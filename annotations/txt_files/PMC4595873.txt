Objectives:
To determine and compare the effects of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.

Methods:
This prospective study included 150 patients affected by severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Gonarthrosis was graded using the Kellgren-Lawrence and Albhack radiographic classification scale. 150 patients were randomized into 2 study groups .In the PRP group (n=55) three intraarticular injection were applied andthe control group (n=55) received 3 intra-articular injections of high molecular weight HA. An unblinded physician performed infiltration once a week for 3 weeks into the knee affected by clinically relevant gonarthrosis (in both groups). All patients were evaluated with the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) score and visual pain scale before the infiltration and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the first injection.

Results:
No severe adverse events was observed. Statistically significant better results in the WOMAC score and visual pain scale was determined in PRP group than HA group at 3 months and 6 months follow up. The cost of the application for the PRP group was lower than that of the HA group.At 12 months' of follow-up, PRP and HA treatments offered similar results.

Conclusion:
The results of this study have shown the application of autologousPRP to be a safe, effective and low-cost method for treating OA tan HA. However, further studies are required for a more clear result
