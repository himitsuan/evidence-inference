Several investigators have shown that hormonal imbalance seen during pregnancy can adversely affect the gingival tissues, which usually manifest in the form of an exaggerated inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Increase in gingival inflammation during pregnancy and resolution following parturition made most of the investigators consider the alterations in the progesterone and estrogen levels during pregnancy to be the major etiologic factor. The present study was designed to evaluate the subgingival plaque microbial flora in pregnant and non-pregnant women, to determine whether pregnancy induces alterations in the subgingival microflora and if these changes can be associated with changes in periodontal status. The result of the present study which included 30 pregnant (10 each belonging to I, II, and III trimester) and 10 non-pregnant women showed a highly significant increase in GI score in II and III trimesters as compared with the I trimester and non-pregnant women (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The comparison of PI scores of these individuals did not show any significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The pocket depth in pregnant and non-pregnant women did not show any significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). These results are in general agreement with previous reports by Kornman and Loeshe,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Jensen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and Raber-Durlacher <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Kornman and Loesche reported a significant increase in gingivitis during pregnancy with peak level during II trimester of pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] In the present study the difference in GI score was marginal between the individuals belonging to the II and III trimester of pregnancy with slight increase during the II trimester. This may be possibly due to the differences in the study design. In the present study, 10 individuals each belonging to the I, II, and III trimesters of pregnancy were evaluated. On the other hand, Kornman and Loesche monitored 20 pregnant women throughout their period of pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] All through their study they did not find any fluctuation in the PI scores. The present study also showed no significant differences in PI scores during the I, II, and III trimesters. Jensen <italic>et al</italic>. in their study showed a significant increase in the GI score of pregnant women as compared with non-pregnant women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] They also showed increased gingival crevicular fluid secretion during pregnancy. They did not find any significant differences in pocket depth between pregnant and non-pregnant women. In the present study also, no significant difference in pocket depth in pregnant and non-pregnant groups could be observed. Raber-Durlacher <italic>et al</italic>., in their study assessed the clinical, endocrinologic, and microbiologic aspects of experimental gingivitis during pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] They found increased swelling, redness, and bleeding on probing during pregnancy. They suggested that as a result of dental plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation develops superimposed on pregnancy-associated physiologic alterations.</p><p>Jonsson <italic>et al</italic>. determined the relationships between periodontal health, salivary steroids, and <italic>Bacteroides intermedius</italic> in males, pregnant and non-pregnant women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] They reported no significant difference between these groups in clinical and bacteriologic parameters. Microbiologic evaluation of subgingival plaque samples in this study revealed that, proportions of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was increased in pregnant women belonging to both II and III trimesters as compared with I trimester and non-pregnant women. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> were prevalent in II and III trimester of pregnancy. However, proportions of other anaerobes included in the study, such as <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, and <italic>P. micra</italic> did not show any significant difference among pregnant and non-pregnant women. These results can be compared with previous reports by Kornman and Loesche,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Jensen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and Raber-Durlacher <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] who also reported an increase in <italic>P. intermedia</italic> during pregnancy.</p><p>Kornman and Loesche studied the subgingival microbial flora during pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Organisms which they included in the study were <italic>Actinomyces naeslundi, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, intermedius, Bacteroides</italic> sub sp. <italic>melaninogenicus, Bacteroides assacharolyticus, Bacteroides ocharaceus, F. nucleatum</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic>. Their results showed an increase in the proportions of <italic>B. melaninogenicus</italic> sub sp. <italic>intermedius</italic> (currently <italic>P. intermedia</italic>) during the II trimester. In the present study, levels of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> did not differ significantly between the individuals who were in their II and III trimesters of pregnancy. But highly significant difference was observed between I and II trimesters. Jensen <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the periodontal status of 3 groups of women: pregnant, non-pregnant, and women taking contraceptives, clinically and microbiologically, especially for the percentage of <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> species and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Their results showed 55-fold increases in the proportions by <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species in pregnant women and 16-fold in women taking oral contraceptives as compared with non-pregnant women. They suggested that increased female sex hormones substituting for naphthaquinone requirement of certain <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species were most likely responsible for their increased proportions during pregnancy. Raber-Durlacher <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] also reported an increase in the mean proportions of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> in subgingival plaque during pregnancy, unlike the reports by Jonsson <italic>et al</italic>. who did not find any difference in the proportions of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> in plaque samples of pregnant and non-pregnant women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The present study showed definite increase in proportions of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> in II and III trimesters as compared with I trimester and non-pregnant women. Carrillo-de-Albornoz <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the influence of hormonal variations on the subgingival biofilm during pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] They found that <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-positive patients presented an increase in gingival inflammation unrelated to plaque. Correlations were also found between maternal hormone levels and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and <italic>P. intermedia</italic>.</p><p>The increased levels of female sex hormones, that is, progesterone and estrogen present during pregnancy seems to be associated with increased GI score and increased proportions of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> in II and III trimesters. This is supported by findings that both the hormones substituted for naphthaquinone (menadione), which is an essential nutrient for <italic>P. intermedia</italic> and it has also been shown that steroid uptake of plaque sample during pregnancy is increased. Since <italic>P. intermedia</italic> is an important periodontal pathogen, an increase in their proportions in subgingival plaque during II and III trimesters of pregnancy has to be considered as a significant change.</p><p>Finally, this study has got certain limitations in terms of sample size and lack of longitudinal evaluation, which would have more clearly depicted the temporal association between pregnancy and gingival changes. Also, biochemical tests were not performed to assess the possible hormonal variations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>On the basis of clinical and microbiologic findings of the present study, definite increase in the proportions of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> occurs in the subgingival plaque microflora during pregnancy. The exaggerated gingival response during pregnancy may be associated with increase in the prevalence of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> in the subgingival plaque. Further studies could be conducted to correlate the concentration of female sex hormones in non-pregnant and pregnant women in all the 3 trimesters with the number of microorganisms and the GI score in pregnancy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sooriyamoorthy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gower</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hormonal influences on gingival tissue: Relationship to periodontal disease</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1989</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>201</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2654195</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal changes in pregnancy</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1965</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>209</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14300227</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Carney</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Dicks</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pregnancy gingivitis: A survey of 100 antenatal patients</article-title><source>J Dent</source><year>1974</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>106</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4531436</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hugoson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gingivitis in pregnant women</article-title><source>Odontol Revy</source><year>1971</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>65</fpage><lpage>84</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5280517</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silness</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal diseases in pregnancy.
