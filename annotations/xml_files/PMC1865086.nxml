<bold>Background:</bold> People who are overweight are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, particularly if they have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). When an individual has IGT, their cells are not able to respond properly to insulin in the blood, which means that blood sugar levels can remain high, and fat cells do not take up fatty acids from blood at the rate they should. The term prediabetes is often used to refer to these linked characteristics. However, if such individuals are able to lose weight they can reduce their chances of becoming diabetic in the future. In particular, loss of a particular type of fat, the visceral fat (packed in around the internal organs, as opposed to fat immediately under the skin), is thought to be beneficial for people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Some researchers have suggested that giving human growth hormone (GH) to people who are overweight might help reduce their levels of visceral fat. At the same time, drugs known as thiazolidinediones are currently used, in combination with other drugs, diet, and exercise, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. The researchers carrying out this study wanted to find out whether combining treatment with human GH and a thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone (PIO), would reduce levels of visceral fat and improve glucose metabolism in overweight adults with IGT. The researchers specifically planned to compare the changes in these primary outcomes amongst people receiving both human GH and PIO for 40 weeks with the changes in individuals receiving placebo only; additional comparisons were also done for individuals receiving either drug alone, as compared to placebo.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> A total of 76 participants were randomized and received the treatment allocated to them, but only 62 participants were included in the final analyses due to losses to follow-up. The primary outcomes being compared at baseline and after 40 weeks of treatment were the change in visceral fat levels and change in individuals' sensitivity to insulin. Individuals receiving GH experienced a drop in visceral fat area over the 40 weeks of the trial, as compared to placebo, whilst PIO alone did not seem to have an effect on visceral fat area. Individuals receiving both GH and PIO, however, also showed a decrease in visceral fat area. When examining the effect on insulin resistance, GH alone did not seem to have an effect on the ability to respond to insulin. However, administration of PIO alone did bring about a decrease in insulin resistance levels, as compared to placebo, and individuals receiving both GH and PIO together also experienced a drop in insulin resistance. The trial was not designed to detect statistically significant differences in side effects between the groups studied, but some side effects, such as build-up of fluid in the limbs and joint stiffness, seemed to be more common in the groups receiving drug treatment than in the placebo group.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Although the trial was small, enough participants were recruited to detect statistically significant changes in the primary outcomes. Strengths of the trial include the use of appropriate techniques to conceal the randomization sequence from investigators recruiting participants into the trial and blinding of both participants and investigators to the treatments that an individual would receive. However, one limitation includes the fact that the likelihood of developing diabetes was not directly measured as an outcome in this trial, and it is therefore not possible to conclude from these results that administration of GH, PIO, or both combined, will help prevent diabetes amongst overweight people with IGT. Finally, this trial compared the drug interventions directly with placebo and not with behavioral interventions such as diet and exercise, which are normally recommended for the prevention of diabetes amongst overweight people. It would be important to further investigate the efficacy, harms, and costs of these drugs directly against nondrug interventions before making any recommendations about their clinical use.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Other studies have shown that PIO administration has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes. This study adds evidence confirming that PIO is likely to have similar effects in people who are not diabetic but who are overweight and who have IGT. The study also adds data regarding the effect of PIO and GH combined in such populations; giving both drugs together seemed to have beneficial effects on visceral fat area and insulin sensitivity, as compared to placebo.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Attallah H, Friedlander AL, Nino-Murcia M, Hoffman AR (2007) Effects of growth hormone and pioglitazone in viscerally obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance: A factorial clinical trial.

Weight loss has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and prevent or delay progression to diabetes [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to recent studies, the improvement in insulin sensitivity that occurs with weight loss is closely linked to the reduction of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the collection of intra-abdominal adipose depots that includes omental and intrahepatic fat [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. After controlling for body mass index (BMI), whole body and subcutaneous fat, only VAT is an independent predictor of endogenous insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism before or after weight loss [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This, in turn, suggests that reducing visceral fat is crucial to improving insulin sensitivity and preventing diabetes in high-risk individuals.</p><p>Recombinant human growth hormone (GH) is a lipolytic drug that reduces total body, abdominal, and visceral fat in GH-deficient adults [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several studies have reported as much as 25%&#x02013;45% reductions in VAT following GH replacement in this population [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Like GH deficient adults, abdominally obese individuals have increased VAT and insulin resistance, and continuous 24-hour measurements indicate that GH levels are below normal [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that GH improves insulin sensitivity when administered over time in men with large waist circumferences (WCs), and this improvement has been indirectly attributed to visceral fat reduction [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The potential benefit of long-term GH administration on insulin sensitivity contrasts with our traditional understanding of direct GH-induced antagonism of insulin action, particularly during acute treatment [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While GH has been extensively studied in adults who were normoglycemic at baseline, less is known about the short- and long-term effects of GH in adults with IGT or diabetes.</p><p>In obese type 2 diabetics, insulin-sensitizing drugs known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) also have been reported to reduce visceral fat and improve insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The combination of a TZD and GH in rodents was shown to counter the short-term, transient diabetogenic effect of GH and reduce both visceral adiposity and insulin resistance over time [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similar studies assessing the combined use of a TZD and GH in humans have not been performed.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of GH and the TZD pioglitazone (PIO) alone and in combination on glucose metabolism, visceral adiposity, and insulin sensitivity in abdominally obese adults with IGT. We hypothesized that (1) compared to GH alone, treatment with GH plus PIO would result in better short-term glucose metabolism; and (2) compared to placebo, treatment with GH plus PIO would lead to greater reductions in both VAT and insulin resistance over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 81 overweight adult men and women were enrolled in the study.

Using this information, we determined that 12 participants were needed per group to have an 80% chance of detecting a change in visceral fat of at least 17.9%.

FPG was measured monthly, and baseline versus post-treatment glucose tolerance was measured using a 3-h OGTT. Glycohemoglobin was measured at baseline and every three months thereafter at the clinical laboratory of the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Body weight was measured monthly, and measurements of WC and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were performed at baseline and again at week 40.</p><p>Post-treatment OGTT and insulin suppression testing were performed on separate days following a 3- to 4-wk washout of study drugs.

With the individual in a supine position, a preliminary scout film of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained to identify anatomic landmarks.

After fasting for ten to 12 h, participants arrived at the Clinical Studies Unit and an intravenous catheter was placed into each antecubital vein. One catheter was used to draw blood for glucose measurements, and the catheter in the contralateral arm was used for infusion of octreotide, insulin, and 20% dextrose solutions. The three infused substances were administered simultaneously. Octreotide acetate (Sandostatin, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novartis.com">http://www.novartis.com</ext-link>) was used to suppress endogenous secretion of insulin and was infused at 0.27 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>/min. Insulin was infused at 32 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min, and 20% dextrose was infused at 267 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/min.

The well-established lipolytic effect of GH has been attributed to suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity or enhanced responsiveness of adipocytes to catecholamine [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Fasting glucose increased during the first four to eight weeks of GH treatment, but this resolved either spontaneously or shortly after GH dose reduction. No significant differences between baseline and post-treatment FPG and OGTT-derived glucose area under the curve were seen following prolonged GH administration. Lipoprotein levels did not change despite a significant reduction in visceral fat content. Although lipid measurements were performed after a three-week washout of study drug, possibility altering the benefit on lipids, trials assessing the effects of prolonged GH administration on lipids have yielded conflicting results [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pctr-0020021-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Insulin sensitivity did not improve after nine months of GH despite VAT reduction. Although GH is known to impair insulin action directly by reducing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 proteins [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a long drug washout was used to reduce possible confounding effects of GH and IGF-1 on glucose disposal [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A possible explanation for the lack of SSPG change is that visceral fat declined 13.1% in the GH group, less than the 18% reduction in visceral fat that was associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity in Johannsson et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unlike the previous investigation, our sample included five women (approximately one-third of the total sample), and GH-treated women are known to achieve smaller reductions in visceral and subcutaneous fat than men [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The diminished effect of GH on body composition in women has been attributed to the estrogen-induced antagonism of GH action [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, although mean BMI did not change and participants were asked to adhere to their usual diet and exercise routine, dietary and lifestyle factors are a potential confound. The lack of rigorous monitoring precluded the maintenance of a stable weight in all participants, and weight gain did occur in individual cases. It has been reported that the lipolytic effect of GH is blunted in individuals who experience weight gain as a result of increased dietary intake or decreased exercise, or both [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We found that 40 weeks of PIO improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with IGT. As with patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the insulin-sensitizing effect of PIO persisted several weeks after the drug was stopped in PIO-treated individuals. However, no significant change in body composition, including visceral or subcutaneous fat content, was seen.</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma with TZDs improves insulin sensitivity by modulating the expression of various genes in the insulin-signaling pathway and increasing the production of glucose transporter proteins [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Miyazaki et al. recently suggested that PIO's beneficial effect on insulin action in type 2 diabetes might be related to a change in body composition [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The authors indicated that a shift in body fat from visceral to subcutaneous fat depots was observed following 16 weeks of PIO, and the change was associated with an improvement in hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. The greater reduction in visceral fat reported in Miyazaki et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] may have been related to the makeup of the study population (patients with type 2 diabetes versus those with IGT) or the use of a higher PIO dose (45 mg/d instead of 30 mg/d). However, other investigators reported no change in visceral fat content in PIO-treated diabetics [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. At present, the overall effect of TZDs on visceral fat content remains uncertain.</p><p>Our sample size was likely not large enough or adequately powered to detect significant changes in glucose concentrations during PIO treatment [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similarly, with regard to multiple testing, the analysis of lipids was performed as an ancillary test that was not prespecified in the protocol. The lack of significance in lipid changes with PIO in the present study was seen in the context of a smaller subset of data analyzed (only 13 participants per group). Therefore, the possibility that the study was not adequately powered to see changes in lipid parameters with PIO must be considered, given that improvements in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol have been reported in PIO-treated diabetics [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It is unclear, however, if PIO exerts different effects on lipids in diabetic versus nondiabetic adults such as the participants in this study.</p><p>In the GH plus PIO group, mean FPG remained stable, and both visceral fat and insulin resistance declined over time. PIO attenuated the diabetogenic effect of GH shortly after GH injections began and before any change in body composition would have been expected. Further, the reduction in visceral fat area that occurred after 40 weeks of GH plus PIO treatment (27 &#x000b1; 4 cm<sup>2</sup>) was similar to the reduction that occurred with GH alone (24 &#x000b1; 7 cm<sup>2</sup>). Only cotreatment with PIO resulted in improved insulin sensitivity, while GH alone did not.

VAT reduction and improved insulin action may not only be important for preventing or delaying diabetes, but also for modulating surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease and improving cardiovascular outcome [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Given the rising costs and growing burden of diabetes on the health-care system [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], strategies that aim to prevent or delay the onset of this disease might be beneficial [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although diet plus exercise is frequently used in experimental settings and is the mainstay for body fat reduction, this approach often fails in clinical situations and is commonly associated with recidivism. For pharmacologic interventions such as GH that might be useful in reducing body fat, cost and side effects are important considerations. The average cost for GH replacement in adults is widely regarded as unacceptably high. However, the cost has declined in recent years, in part because of evolving dosing strategies that have steadily lowered initial GH doses used to achieve similar efficacy [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Similarly, GH-associated side effects are generally transient or are well tolerated, and treatment discontinuation is not common, particularly with the lower GH doses that have been advocated in recent years [<xref rid="pctr-0020021-b059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Further, the issue of cost with the use of GH in obesity must be considered in the overall context of the soaring costs and rising health-care burden of diabetes. Given the link between visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, future studies assessing the body composition and metabolic effects of GH + PIO in adults with the metabolic syndrome may be warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020021-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(49 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020021.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020021-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><caption><p>(287 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020021.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Leah Holloway, all of the clinical research nurses, and the following research volunteers who helped with recruitment and data analysis: Nilima Desai, MD; Kavitha Mothkuri, MD; Sejal Patel, MD; Farzana Sheikh, MD; Jamie Green and Nandini Dayananda, MD.
