Asymptomatic, latent TB infection may reactivate at a later stage, particularly if the individual acquires immunodeficiency from HIV. In low prevalence countries a predominant goal is to detect and treat latent TB in order to achieve the stage of TB elimination. This includes testing high risk groups such as close contacts of an active TB case, HIV-infected, and children below 5 years of age <xref rid="pone.0064215-World2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Shingadia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of latent TB. Many guidelines include Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) and the interferon-&#x003b3; release assays (IGRAs) QuantiFERON&#x000ae;-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-IT, Cellestis, Carnegie, Australia) and T-SPOT&#x000ae;.<italic>TB</italic> (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK) for the detection of latent TB, either alone or in combination <xref rid="pone.0064215-Abubakar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Denkinger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Pai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Tuberculin skin testing (TST) has been used for a century <xref rid="pone.0064215-Mantoux1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is a &#x0201c;low tech&#x0201d; procedure resulting in an induration typically 10&#x02013;20 mm in diameter at the injection site of an MTB infected patient <xref rid="pone.0064215-Snider1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064215-Huebner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. TST can be delivered and interpreted by point-of-care medical, nursing or paramedical staff, has no need for a laboratory, with a sensitivity around 75&#x02013;90% <xref rid="pone.0064215-Snider1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Huebner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Reactivity to PPD may appear around 6 weeks after exposure to MTB <xref rid="pone.0064215-Poulsen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. PPDs main disadvantage is its cross-reactivity with environmental mycobacteria and all BCG vaccine strains. To compensate for this cut-off points between 5 and 15 mm of induration are recommended in various guidelines <xref rid="pone.0064215-World2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, if infected with HIV a low cut-off point may be used in spite of known BCG vaccination. This gives rise to a complex interpretation of PPD results with numerous local variations and clinical uncertainties.</p><p>The IGRAs are blood based <italic>in vitro</italic> assays based on peptides covering the MTB specific, BCG-deleted antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 giving specificities of 98&#x02013;100% <xref rid="pone.0064215-Diel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Due to costs and complexity the World Health Organization issued in 2011 a &#x02018;negative&#x02019; policy statement with a caution against replacing TST by IGRAs as public health intervention to detect latent MTB infection in low- and middle-income settings <xref rid="pone.0064215-World3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As discussed in a recent workshop there is a need for an improved skin test <xref rid="pone.0064215-Pai2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

The recruited patients were diagnosed with active TB with a compatible clinical picture of TB with the intention to treat (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064215-t001">Table 1</xref>). Participants were recruited from outpatient clinics in the South West area of London within the first 2 month of acute phase of antibiotic treatment and included with a positive culture, PCR result, smear microscopy, or IGRA result. Treatments with products likely to modify the immune response (e.g. corticosteroids or blood products) or HIV infection were exclusion criteria. The patients were recruited in 3 groups of 12. The first group received 0.01 &#x000b5;g preserved and unpreserved C-Tb in either arm according to a randomization code. Based on an evaluation of safety and skin reactions the last two groups received the same dose of 0.1 &#x000b5;g. Follow-up visits took place after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 28 days and included measurements of indurations and erythema. Immediate pain caused by the injections was assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) using a ruler (Schlenker Enterprises LTD). The ruler transformed various degrees of pain visualized by smileys into a scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst possible). Blood samples for haematology and biochemistry analyses were collected at baseline screening within 28 days before skin testing and at last visit 21&#x02013;32 days after testing.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0064215-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0064215.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Distribution of primary site of tuberculosis infection and number of patients in dose-finding trial.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0064215-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0064215.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">C-Tb dose group (/0.1 mL)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB diagnose</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.01 &#x000b5;g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1 &#x000b5;g</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pulmonary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lymph node</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (23%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pleural</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (16%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spinal</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (25%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB meningitis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">1</xref>

The most important exclusion criteria were history of TB or close contact to a person with active TB, a positive QFT-IT at inclusion, immunosuppressive treatment, congenital and/or acquired immune deficiency or pregnancy. C-Tb and PPD were injected by Mantoux technique and the diameter of any induration measured after 2&#x02013;3 days. All systemic and local adverse events occurring within 28 days were recorded. Laboratory safety parameters of haematology and biochemistry and a 2<sup>nd</sup> QFT-IT were performed on day 28. An IFN&#x003b3; response occurring at this time point was regarded an immune reaction to C-Tb/PPD and an additional blood sample was collected after 6 months for a repeated measurement to investigate the duration of the response.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample Size Calculation</title><p>The sample size of 12 (24) in the dose finding trial was mainly based on practical considerations. However, a group of 12 (24) volunteers gave 72% (92%) chance of discovering an unacceptable adverse reaction appearing at a true frequency of 10%.</p><p>The specificity was estimated as a relative frequency in a binomial distribution. With N patients the variance of the estimated specificity (&#x000fb;) is Var(&#x000fb;)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;u(1&#x02013;u)/N, where u is the (unknown) true specificity.

With N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;150 this maximum is 0.25/N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0017 corresponding to a standard deviation SD(&#x000fb;) of 0.041. As the true specificity is expected to be higher than 0.5 the standard deviation of 0.041 is a worst case scenario. With a more realistic value for the true specificity of 0.8 the corresponding standard deviation becomes 0.033, which was considered an acceptable precision of the estimate.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data Safety Monitoring Board</title><p>A Data Safety Monitoring Board consisting of four independent senior clinicians was established for the dose-finding trial to evaluate adverse reactions prior to proceeding to the next strength of C-Tb.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The trials were conducted according to &#x0201c;Note for guidance on good clinical practice&#x0201d;, CPMP/ICH/135/95, ICH topic E6 and CPMP/ICH/377/95 E2A and in accordance with the ethical principles of the edition of the Declaration of Helsinki, adopted at the 59th World Medical Association General Assembly, Seoul, in October 2008.

It was found that 0.1 &#x000b5;g rdESAT-6 gave an induration similar in size to 2 TU PPD RT 23 SSI. To increase sensitivity rCFP-10 was subsequently included in C-Tb <xref rid="pone.0064215-vanPinxteren1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In a first-in-man trial C-Tb showed no signs of false positive reactions (no sensitisation) if healthy participants were tested twice 6 weeks apart corresponding to the incubation period of TB <xref rid="pone.0064215-Bergstedt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In MTB infected guinea pigs C-Tb showed the same dose response as previously described with rdESAT-6 (data not shown) <xref rid="pone.0064215-Aggerbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Yet, as a safety precaution the initial dose of C-Tb was reduced to 0.01 &#x000b5;g in the dose finding trial described here because this study took place in TB patients with a risk of more adverse reactions and stronger responsiveness than in treated cases. PPD was not included as direct comparator as it might already have been applied during diagnostic workup giving a risk of a booster response <xref rid="pone.0064215-Huebner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, indurations with 0.1 &#x000b5;g C-Tb were similar to those reported previously for PPD <xref rid="pone.0064215-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Huebner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. When used in standard doses in patients with active TB, PPD may induce painful responses with ulceration. It was therefore reassuring that in this population of active TB cases, C-Tb was associated with few, minor adverse reactions, of which itching and pain were the most frequent and probably inevitable parts of the diagnostic immune response.</p><p>For optimal cost effectiveness C-Tb could be distributed in multi-dose vials, so C-Tb was preserved with 0.5% phenol to comply with the European Pharmacopoeia on antimicrobial efficacy. It is encouraging therefore that phenol did not seem to give rise to unspecific indurations or affect adverse reactions in patients with active tuberculosis tested with C-Tb. This concurs with two studies done in 2000 investigating unpreserved and phenol preserved PPD RT 23. The studies included 209 healthy participants and 55 TB patients in Lithuania and 319 healthy participants in Sweden. Similar immune responses were observed, but VAS scores showed more pronounced immediate pain with the unpreserved preparation (SSI unpublished data). In the present study the numbers were too low to verify a positive influence of phenol on the injection site pain. This may partly be due to the fact that 16/38 patients were asked a differently phrased question about the pain during the conduct of the trial.</p><p>In the specificity trial four of the 147 QFT-IT negative, healthy participants had an induration response with C-Tb. As there is no gold standard to identify latent TB it cannot be ruled out that some of the responders may be true C-Tb positives. The participant with a 9 mm C-Tb response worked as an ambulance technician, and although he did not give a specific history of contact with a known TB case, one could speculate that this occupation may expose him to an increased risk of contact with a contagious case of TB. Nonetheless, our data suggest a specificity of C-Tb of 99% at a cut-off 5 mm. This is similar to the specificities reported for the blood-based IGRAs <xref rid="pone.0064215-Pai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064215-Diel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In comparison a specificity of 92% was seen with PPD RT 23 using a cut-off of 15 mm to compensate for non-specific contribution to the induration response by prior BCG vaccination. Because QFT-IT was part of the inclusion criteria to ensure a low risk of MTB infection, a direct comparison of C-Tb and QFT-IT was not possible due to bias.</p><p>Based on the prevalence of childhood BCG immunization different regions employ different cut-offs for PPD, so it is evident that use of a single cut-off for C-Tb irrespective of BCG status will simplify the interpretation of a skin reaction.</p><p>C-Tb and QFT-IT takes advantage of the same antigens, and the trials described here indicate a similar performance of the two tests. However, in four cases in the dose-finding study C-Tb and QFT-IT showed discordant results in patients confirmed by culture or smear. Discordance could not be explained by the site of infection as both groups were represented by one case of lymph node and one case of pulmonary TB. Part may be related to the definition of positive test result as one testing positive with C-Tb showed an IFN&#x003b3; result of 0.31 IU/ml slightly below the cut-off for QFT-IT. Another reason could be difference in incubation time, overnight for QFT-IT vs. 2&#x02013;3 days for C-Tb, which could affect the sensitivity. The degree of discordance between C-Tb and QFT-IT of 18% was of the same magnitude as previously reported for QFT-IT and T-SPOT&#x000ae;.<italic>TB</italic>
