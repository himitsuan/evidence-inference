I-Gel&#x02122; (Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) is a cuffless, single-use second-generation SAD made of a soft gel-like thermoplastic elastomer (styrene butadiene ethylene-styrene) which provides an excellent perilaryngeal seal.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Due to its potential advantages, I-Gel&#x02122; has gained widespread popularity among paediatric anaesthetists.</p><p>We were interested to know whether PLMA would be able to provide better OPLP and ventilation compared to I-Gel&#x02122; in the different head-and-neck positions in children.</p><p>Therefore, we designed this prospective randomised trial to evaluate and compare the performance of PLMA and I-Gel&#x02122; in the different head-and-neck positions in anaesthetised paralysed children. The primary outcome was the OPLP of the two study devices in maximum flexion, extension and neutral position. Secondary outcomes included the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), expired tidal volume, ventilation scoring and grading of fibreoptic view.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted from June 2014 to December 2015 in the advanced paediatric centre of a tertiary care hospital after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (NK/1606/MD/10039-40). Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of 70 American Society of Anaesthesiologists Grade I or II children of either gender weighing between 10 and 30 kg enrolled in the study. Children having upper respiratory tract infection on the day of surgery, anticipated difficult airway or children at increased risk of aspiration such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, non-fasting status, hiatus hernia, lung diseases and limited head-neck movements were excluded from the study.</p><p>Children were fasted 6 h for solid food, 4 h for milk and 2 h for clear water. Monitoring included pulse oximetry, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiography and capnography (Aestiva 5&#x02122; 7900, Datex Ohme2 orda, Madison, USA) was done. General anaesthesia was induced with 100% oxygen with sevoflurane (6%&#x02013;8%). Injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenously (IV) was given an analgesic and injection atracurium 0.5 mg/kg IV was administered for muscle relaxation. Children were randomised to have inserted either I-Gel&#x02122; size 2 or 2.5 or PLMA size 2 or 2.5 using computer-generated randomisation chart (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). The allocation was concealed in opaque envelopes that were opened only before the start of anaesthesia. The appropriate sized allocated device was inserted following manufacturer's recommendations. An introducer was used to insert appropriate sized PLMA.</p><p>Effective ventilation of the device was defined as bilateral chest movements on gentle manual ventilation and square shaped capnograph trace. A maximum of two insertion attempts were allowed before considering it as failure to insert the device. Endotracheal intubation was performed in case failure to insert the device satisfactorily or if there was displacement of the device resulting in an inability to ventilate.</p><p>After successful insertion of the study device, the patient's lungs were ventilated for 3 min with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 12&#x02013;20/min according to patient's age in a neutral position. The neutral position was made by aligning the external ear canal and the superior orbital margin of the eye in a vertical plane to the horizontal operating table. The OPLP, PIP, expired tidal volume, ventilation scoring and fibreoptic grading were recorded in the neutral position. Thereafter, the position of the head-and-neck was changed to maximum extension (45&#x000b0; from neutral) or maximum flexion (45&#x000b0; from neutral) in random order. The degree angle at each position was measured using a goniometer. After 30&#x02013;60 s of each position change the OPLP, PIP, expired tidal volume, ventilation scoring and fibreoptic grading were recorded.</p><p>OPLP was measured using closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 L/min and recording the airway pressure at which the dial on a calibrated aneroid manometer reached equilibrium. The maximum airway pressures were not allowed to exceed 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The oropharyngeal leak was determined either at the mouth (audible), the stomach (epigastric auscultation) or at the drainage tube (bubbling of lubricant placed on the proximal end of the drainage tube).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Adequacy of ventilation was assessed based on three criteria: (1) No leakage with an airway pressure of 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, (2) Bilateral chest excursion with a PIP of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and (3) Square wave capnograph. Each point was given a score of either 0 or 1 point. Thus, if all three criteria were satisfied, the ventilation score was 3.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Fibreoptic grading was determined by passing a 3.5 mm fibreoptic scope (I-view&#x02122; scope, VBM India Co., New Delhi, India) through the airway tube to a position 1 cm proximal to the end of the tube. Fibreoptic scoring was done based on scores used by Okuda <italic>et al</italic>. (4 - &#x0003c;1/3 view covered with epiglottis, 3-1/3&#x02013;2/3 view covered with epiglottis, 2 - &#x0003e;2/3 view covered with epiglottis, 1-completely covered with epiglottis but having an adequate function).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>At the end of the surgery, the device was removed after complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Complications with device insertion, maintenance or removal such as airway reflex activation (coughing, laryngospasm or bronchospasm), desaturation (SpO2 &#x0003c;90%) or blood staining on the device after removal were noted.</p><p>Sample size calculation was determined from a pilot study on ten patients. Assuming the largest difference in mean OPLP (standard deviation [SD]) cm H<sub>2</sub>O between the different positions to be 4 (4.2) cm H<sub>2</sub>O within the two study devices, namely PLMA and I-Gel&#x02122;, we calculated the sample size of 31 with an alpha error of 0.05 and power of 0.8. To account for dropouts or study failures, 35 children were enrolled in each group.</p><p>Data were presented as the difference of mean (SD), median (range) or an absolute number of patients. Intragroup comparisons of OPLP, PIP and expired tidal volume were done using repeated measures analysis of variance. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was applied for comparing fibreoptic scoring, and Friedman's (non-parametric) test was used to compare ventilation score. Data between the two groups were analysed using the unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney test. For the analysis of nominal data, we used Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test. SPSS software Version 22 (IBM Inc., NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Out of 100 children assessed for eligibility, 70 children were randomised according to the study protocol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the consort diagram of the enrolled patients.

A significant increase in PIP and decrease in expired tidal volume were noted during neck flexion with I-Gel&#x02122; compared to PLMA. The ventilation scores and the fibreoptic gradings were similar with both I-Gel&#x02122; and PLMA in all the three different neck positions.</p><p>The mean values of OPLP of PLMA and I-Gel&#x02122; were comparable in all the different head-and-neck positions. So far, there have been contradictory reports with regard to the comparison of OPLP between these two devices.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>OPLP increased with flexion of the neck and decreased in neck extension with both the devices. Similar results have been replicated in studies using different SAD's in both adults and children.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Jain <italic>et al</italic>. showed a significant increase in OPLP during flexion and decreased during extension with I-Gel&#x02122; in 30 anaesthetised paralysed children.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Similarly, an increase in OPLP with classic LMA (CLMA) during flexion and decrease during extension was observed in 39 non-paralysed anaesthetised children.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Flexion results in decrease in the longitudinal tension on anterior pharyngeal muscles which settle over the mask of the SAD's providing better seal and reverse is seen during extension.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] So far, the effect of the different head-and-neck positions on OPLP of PLMA in children has not been evaluated in children. Therefore, no direct comparison can be made.</p><p>In contrast to the previous studies, we compared the mean difference and the precent change in the OPLP with each position change. In the current study, PLMA group resulted in 25% increase in the mean OPLP compared to 17.4% with I-Gel&#x02122; from neutral to flexed neck position (<italic>P</italic> = 0.042). The greater increase in mean OPLP with PLMA in comparison to I-Gel&#x02122; can be attributed to the larger and more compliable mask of PLMA compared to I-Gel&#x02122;.</p><p>In another similar study comparing laryngeal tube (LT) to CLMA in children, Biedler <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated higher OPLP with LT compared to CLMA in all the different head-and-neck positions.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In spite of higher OPLP with LT compared to CLMA in all the different head-and-neck positions, approximately 27% increase in OPLP with CLMA compared to 14% increase with LT with a change in position from neutral to neck flexion was neither noted or commented on. These findings further suggest the need for interpreting the results with a mean difference or percentage change with every position change, especially when there is a difference in mean values of OPLP and other ventilation parameters in the neutral position itself. This additional knowledge can alter the clinical interpretation of the results.</p><p>Neck flexion results in narrowing of the laryngeal inlet, increase in deflection of the posterior epiglottis and worsening of alignment of the pharyngeal and the laryngeal axis. Conglomeration of all these factors leads to an increase in the PIP during neck flexion.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Along with it, compression of the cuff against a narrowed laryngeal inlet results in loss of the delivered tidal volume which was seen with both the devices during flexion.</p><p>PLMA resulted in significantly lower PIP and higher expired tidal volume in flexion compared to I-Gel&#x02122;. I-Gel&#x02122; resulted in 51.2% increase in PIP and 38.6% decrease in expired tidal volume compared to 25.9% increase in PIP and 23.6% decrease in expired tidal volume with PLMA. This better preservation of ventilation parameters with PLMA can be attributed to the larger area of cross-section of the ventilation hole of PLMA (4 &#x000d7; 2 for size 2.5 and 3.2 &#x000d7; 1.5 for size 2) compared to I-Gel&#x02122; (2 &#x000d7; 1.8 for size 2.5 and 1.8 &#x000d7; 1.5 for size 2) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] which provides PLMA the added advantage of greater buffer area for ventilation during flexion, when the laryngeal space is less, and cuff of devices are compressed.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of ventilation apertures of ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (4 &#x000d7; 2 for size 2.5 and 3.2 &#x000d7; 1.5 for size 2) and I-Gel&#x02122; (1.8 &#x000d7; 1.5 for size 2 and 2 &#x000d7; 1.8 for size 2.5)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-62-103-g005"/></fig><p>The greater increase in OPLP and relatively lesser change in PIP and expired tidal volume during flexion with PLMA can prove advantageous over I-Gel&#x02122; while using in surgeries requiring flexed position. As we did not perform any power calculation for the secondary outcomes, these results can be considered exploratory, and they can provide the basis of future research.</p><p>Unlike adults, the epiglottis of children is large, floppy, and more horizontally placed. In spite of the optimal placement of the supraglottic airway, a part of the epiglottis is generally visible on the fibreoptic assessment of the glottic aperture through the SAD. Therefore, in our study, we used the fiberoptic grading proposed by Okuda <italic>et al</italic>., which is better suited for the assessment of the paediatric airway.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Fibreoptic grades of glottis view through PLMA and I-Gel&#x02122; were comparable in all the three different positions. Most of the previous studies have shown little or no correlation between fibreoptic view and function of SADs. The changes in fibreoptic grade are considered to be a poor marker of the adequacy of ventilation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A study reported adequate ventilation with even poor fiberoptic score of 1&#x02013;3.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Others have suggested radiological examination (magnetic resonance imaging) to confirm the airway location and to determine the exact site of obstruction, if present. However, such studies have not been done so far.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study should be interpreted in the light of some limitations. This study was carried on anaesthetised paralysed children, and therefore, these results cannot be extrapolated to spontaneously breathing children. Flexion results in an increase in the PIP and use of muscle relaxants tend to improve the lung compliance and provide a safety margin for ventilation in a flexed position. Second, radiological confirmation for airway changes could have added to the best of our knowledge but was not feasible in our setting. In the present trial, although we had selected only size 2 and 2.5, excluding the infants and the bigger children, the difference in performance at the two ends of the range of weight of children in the study groups and variation in PIP due to the difference in the respiratory rate among different age groups cannot be ruled out. We evaluated the devices in children above 10 kg, owing to increase in the complication rate with device displacement in the younger age group. Efficacy of these devices is smaller age groups needs to be determined through future trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Oropropharyngeal leak pressure was similar with both thePLMA and I-Gel&#x02122; in the neutral position, maximum neck flexion and maximum neck extension. Although ventilation was possible with both the devices in all three positions, I-Gel&#x02122; resulted in higher PIP and lower expired tidal volume than PLMA in maximum flexion which warrants caution and future evaluation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brimacombe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The influence of head and neck position on oropharyngeal leak pressure and cuff position with the flexible and the standard laryngeal mask airway</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1999</year><volume>88</volume><fpage>913</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10195547</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buckham</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Brooker</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Brimacombe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparison of the reinforced and standard laryngeal mask airway: Ease of insertion and the influence of head and neck position on oropharyngeal leak pressure and intracuff pressure</article-title><source>Anaesth Intensive Care</source><year>1999</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>628</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10631418</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Do</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The influence of head and neck position on the oropharyngeal leak pressure and cuff position of three supraglottic airway devices</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2009</year><volume>108</volume><fpage>112</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19095838</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Howes</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Supraglottic airway devices: Recent advances</article-title><source>Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care Pain</source><year>2011</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>56</fpage><lpage>61</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Intersurgical</article-title><source>I-gel&#x02122;
