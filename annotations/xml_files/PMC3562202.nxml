However, current evidence reveals that hemiparetic weakness impairs the capacity to perform, and practice, movements appropriately. Here we investigated how power training (i.e., high-intensity, dynamic resistance training) affects recovery of upper-extremity motor function post-stroke. We hypothesized that power training, as a component of upper-extremity rehabilitation, would promote greater functional gains than functional task practice without deleterious consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Nineteen chronic hemiparetic individuals were studied using a crossover design. All participants received both functional task practice (FTP) and HYBRID (combined FTP and power training) in random order. Blinded evaluations performed at baseline, following each intervention block and 6-months post-intervention included: Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT-FAS, Primary Outcome), upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, Ashworth Scale, and Functional Independence Measure. Neuromechanical function was evaluated using isometric and dynamic joint torques and concurrent agonist EMG. Biceps stretch reflex responses were evaluated using passive elbow stretches ranging from 60 to 180&#x000ba;/s and determining: EMG onset position threshold, burst duration, burst intensity and passive torque at each speed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Primary outcome: Improvements in WMFT-FAS were significantly greater following HYBRID vs. FTP (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.049), regardless of treatment order. These functional improvements were retained 6-months post-intervention (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03).</p><p>Secondary outcomes: A greater proportion of participants achieved minimally important differences (MID) following HYBRID vs. FTP (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03). MIDs were retained 6-months post-intervention. Ashworth scores were unchanged (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05).</p><p>Increased maximal isometric joint torque, agonist EMG and peak power were significantly greater following HYBRID vs. FTP (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .05) and effects were retained 6-months post-intervention (<italic>p</italic>&#x02019;s&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). EMG position threshold and burst duration were significantly reduced at fast speeds (&#x02265;120&#x000ba;/s) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02019;s &#x0003c; 0.05) and passive torque was reduced post-washout (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .05) following HYBRID.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Functional and neuromechanical gains were greater following HYBRID vs. FPT. Improved stretch reflex modulation and increased neuromuscular activation indicate potent neural adaptations. Importantly, no deleterious consequences, including exacerbation of spasticity or musculoskeletal complaints, were associated with HYBRID.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While the problem is well recognized, there is little evidence demonstrating the most effective approach for promoting functional motor recovery of the hemiparetic upper-extremity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Prominent manifestations of compromised motor control following stroke include: impaired inter-segmental coordination
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], hyperreflexia or spasticity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and weakness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Rather than mechanical factors such as muscle fibre type or cross-sectional area, hemiparetic weakness results predominantly from disorganized neuromotor output, including impaired descending motor drive, and activation impairment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that weakness plays a more significant role than traditionally believed and contributes directly to compromised motor function post-stroke
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast to fundamental traditional clinical tenets
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], contemporary research demonstrates that neither high-exertion activities nor resistance training, per se, exacerbate spasticity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Lower extremity resistance exercise has revealed improvements in functional task performance including: walking, rising from a chair, and stair climbing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and self-perceived disability
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] in persons post-stroke. However, the role of strength
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the effects of strengthening have only recently been systematically investigated in the hemiparetic upper-extremity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Here we investigated two forms of upper-extremity rehabilitation for persons post-stroke: 1) functional task practice (FTP) and 2) functional task practice combined with upper-extremity power training (i.e., dynamic high-intensity resistance training) which we refer to as HYBRID. We hypothesized that inclusion of power training in upper-extremity rehabilitation would produce greater effects on clinical and neuromechanical indicators of functional motor recovery without producing detrimental effects including exacerbation of spasticity. Because there is little evidence to support inclusion of either high-intensity or resistance training, we conducted a clinical trial to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of upper-extremity power training in persons post-stroke. Our observations confirm our hypothesis and demonstrate positive functional outcomes, increased strength and joint power, improved reflex modulation and retention of treatment effects in the absence of additional intervention. Importantly, our findings indicate no negative consequences (i.e., exacerbation of spasticity, joint pain or injury) resulting from inclusion of power training in upper-extremity rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We studied nineteen individuals in the chronic phase of recovery, operationally defined as 7-18 months post-stroke.

Separate random orders prepared at study initiation for higher and lower functioning participants were allocated to sealed envelopes and kept by the study coordinator in a locked drawer. Following baseline clinical assessment, the blinded evaluator informed the study coordinator of the participant&#x02019;s hemiparetic severity (i.e., higher v. lower). The coordinator selected a sequentially numbered sealed envelope from the appropriate group (i.e., higher vs. lower). This envelope was given to the treating physical therapist who broke the seal to reveal the assignment to treatment order. Stratification on the basis of hemiparetic severity was done to assure baseline equivalence between groups (i.e., Order A and Order B). Participants were informed that the study goal was to investigate the efficacy of two forms of upper-extremity rehabilitation and were actively counseled to not discuss the specific therapeutic activities with study personnel other than the treatment physical therapist.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic interventions</title><p>Algorithms for both the FTP and HYBRID interventions have been described in detail elsewhere
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Briefly, treatments were administered on alternate days (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) at the same time of day. Individual sessions were 75 minutes in duration and initiated with 10-15 minutes of stretching and passive range of motion.</p><sec><title>Functional task practice</title><p>The control intervention involved functional task practice structured according to principles of motor learning
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and utilized a progression of six therapeutic goals and nine activity categories. Specific tasks, chosen from the activity categories, were practiced on a structured rotation within the framework of the current therapeutic goal. Each of the six treatment goals was addressed for two sessions and treatment progressed to the next therapeutic goal independent of whether mastery of the current goal had been achieved. A variety of therapeutic tasks were developed for each of the nine activity categories (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which were identified for individual participants on the basis of functional level, his/her personal goals and needs. Within each session the time devoted to each activity category was held constant at 10 minutes. Thus, individual sessions involved tasks from six activity categories. Each of the nine activity categories was addressed twice per week. Our approach: i) allowed for structure and repeatability across multiple participants in a three-year intervention study, ii) afforded flexibility to accommodate participants presenting with varied hemiparetic severity and functional deficits, and iii) allowed the therapist to tailor intervention using patient-centered goals

The structure of the FTP program is outlined in <bold>Panel A</bold> with examples of how activities were identified for study participants of varying abilities and progressed over the course of the intervention. Power training was delivered using a commercially available dynamometer fitted with custom attachments to enable non-standard positioning and accommodate individuals with impaired grasp. Pictured in <bold>Panel B</bold> are configurations for elbow flexion/extension (top), shoulder abduction (middle) and shoulder external rotation. The elbow flexion/extension configuration was also used for stretch reflex testing. Power training involved 3 sets of 10 repetitions of each exercise: shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, shoulder external rotation, elbow flexion/extension. The criterion speeds for each set were varied using the protocol illustrated in <bold>Panel C</bold>. The first set of each exercise involved eccentric actions in which the participant resisted the dynamometer through the full range of motion. Using data reported by Colsen et al
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (see Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) to estimate the power produced (i.e., torque x velocity) per contraction, the program was systematically progressed by increasing workload by 44% (Sessions 5-8 relative to 1-4) and 84% (Sessions 9-12 relative to 1-4).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-0003-10-1-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>HYBRID intervention</title><p>The experimental intervention combined power training with FTP. Each treatment session divided time between upper-extremity power training (35 minutes) and FTP (25-30 minutes). The abbreviated FTP component addressed six of the nine activity categories, which were selected on the basis of the participant&#x02019;s abilities and goals. Each individual session involved practice of four activity categories for seven minutes each. Power training involved four reciprocal upper-limb movements: shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder external/internal rotation and transverse plane elbow flexion/extension and was delivered using a Biodex System 3.0 Pro dynamometer<sup>a</sup>. Custom attachments, designed to accommodate hand and wrist weakness, were used to enable hemiparetic participants to engage the dynamometer without grasping and to optimize positioning for performance through a full range of motion for each joint (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Where necessary, the attachments were counterbalanced to minimize the effect of lifting the weight of the attachment against gravity. Each power training session involved three sets of 10 repetitions of each movement
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The first set was eccentric (e.g., resisting an externally imposed load) and the second two sets were concentric, delivered at different criterion speeds. The dynamometer was controlled in isokinetic mode (i.e., constrained to pre-set speed). Over the course of treatment, movement speeds were advanced in 30&#x000ba;/s increments in concentric sets (i.e., from 30-120&#x000ba;/s) and 15&#x000ba;/s increments in eccentric sets (i.e., from 30-75&#x000ba;/s) (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Power training targeted proximal joints (e.g., shoulder and elbow).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participant compliance</title><p>All treatment sessions were completed within the timeframe of the study design. Several factors specific to our setting enabled 100% compliance with the intervention protocols. First, this study was conducted in a free standing rehabilitation research center where study personnel were tasked to project activities rather than routine clinical care. If a participant was unable to attend a session, makeup sessions were scheduled as soon as possible and, only if necessary, on an adjacent day. This measure was taken to assure delivery of the requisite number of treatments in the timeframe specified by the study protocol. The costs of study personnel and participant transportation were underwritten by grant support, thus the therapeutic intervention was delivered at no cost to the participant or his/her insurance provider. In exchange, participants agreed to all intervention sessions and return for follow up evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment battery</title><p>A comprehensive battery of clinical and neuromechanical assessments was administered by blinded evaluators at five times across the study: baseline, following each treatment block, following the washout period and at six months post-intervention.

Neuromotor activation was assessed using surface electromyography recorded from eight upper-extremity muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, anterior/middle/posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, brachioradialis, and pectoralis major) using active, pre-amplified surface electrodes (17mm inter-electrode distance).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> (Panel B, top). Surface EMG was recorded from the brachioradialis, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii (long head) muscles using pre-amplified electrodes<sup>b</sup> (MA-311). Analog position and torque signals were sampled directly from the dynamometer at 2kHz written directly to disk for offline analysis.</p><p>For each test session, participants were seated in the dynamometer chair with the back angled at 85&#x000ba;, the trunk stabilized using waist and trunk straps, and the feet supported using the leg rest. The hemiparetic arm was positioned with the shoulder in 70-80&#x000ba; abduction, and 5-10&#x000ba; forward flexion with the medial epicondyle of the humerus aligned with the dynamometer rotational axis. The arm was stabilized using an adjustable support to balance the weight of the limb and eliminate excess shoulder rotation during elbow flexion and extension. The wrist and hand were positioned in pronation using a pre-fabricated wrist splint and straps added to the standard dynamometer wrist attachment. Passive elbow extensions covered a 100&#x000ba; range ending at the participant&#x02019;s full anatomical range of motion. The anatomical position was determined using a handheld goniometer and reported in degrees of elbow flexion (i.e., full extension&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x000ba;). Anatomical angles were used to report subject-specific joint angles for the onset of reflex activity. The dynamometer angle corresponding with 90&#x000ba; elbow flexion was recorded in A/D units and used to reproduce the anatomical 90&#x000ba; elbow flexion position in subsequent evaluation sessions. Positioning was replicated at each session by recording the dynamometer and chair position settings for each participant.</p><p>Velocity-dependent reflex responses were tested by operating the dynamometer in passive mode under panel control. Each trial was comprised of four phases: i) 10 second static hold in elbow flexion; ii) passive elbow extension at criterion speed; iii) 5 second static hold in full extension; iv) passive return to elbow flexion at 30&#x000ba;/s. During all movement phases, participants were instructed to relax as the limb was moved through the full range of elbow motion by the dynamometer. Torque, position and EMG data were collected before and during passive elbow extension stretches. Passive stretches were delivered at five criterion speeds (i.e., 60&#x000ba;/s, 90&#x000ba;/s, 120&#x000ba;/s, 150&#x000ba;/s, 180&#x000ba;/s). After every third trial the test speed was incremented by 30&#x000ba;/s to obtain three trials at each criterion. Two additional trials were obtained at 10&#x000ba;/s to quantify passive joint torques. The reliability of both EMG and torque responses has been established for ramp-and-hold stretches obtained using this paradigm and range of speeds

The torque and position signals were digitally lowpass filtered (20 Hz cutoff, zero-phase shift, 1<sup>st</sup>-order Butterworth filter). Velocity was determined by calculating the derivative of the filtered position signal. This calculated signal was subsequently digitally lowpass filtered at 20 Hz. Maximal isometric joint torque (MVIC), agonist EMG at MVIC, and peak power were evaluated for the five movements listed above. Muscle length and joint position effects were controlled by defining a 15&#x000ba; window centered at the optimal position<sup>e</sup> for each joint action. Isometric, concentric and eccentric torque, velocity and EMG were evaluated over this range. Power was calculated as the product of torque and velocity within this window. Peak power was extracted from the condition (i.e., 30, 75 or 120&#x000ba;/s) producing the highest value. Neuromuscular activation was evaluated by determining the EMG amplitude during MVIC.

While these proportions suggest greater improvements following the retention period, mean changes at each speed expressed as a percentage of baseline torque (Figure

Our main finding is that inclusion of power training (i.e., dynamic, high-intensity resistance training) in a program of upper-extremity rehabilitation is feasible, without negative consequences including either musculoskeletal compromise or exacerbation of spasticity. Functional recovery, as documented by the WMFT-FAS and other clinical indicators, was greater following HYBRID than FTP. Intervention-related effects were both retained and, in some cases, advanced during a 6-month retention period. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating advancement of intervention-related improvements over a 6-month period of no additional intervention.</p><p>Several novel aspects of the intervention reported here likely contribute to our positive results: 1) high-intensity workloads with progression to advance the challenge over the course of the intervention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]; 2) dynamic contractions that challenged the impaired nervous system to increase movement speed and muscle power; 3) presentation of eccentric contractions which &#x02013; a) increases the absolute magnitude of the training stimulus, b) involves alternative neural strategies for execution, c) requires force production throughout the full range of motion and therefore facilitate reacquisition of this critical neural mechanism of force production.</p><sec><title>Relationship of findings to current research results</title><p>Other studies have compared strengthening and task practice for persons post-stroke in the sub-acute
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and chronic
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] periods of recovery with conclusions of both favoring functional task practice. Careful examination of the methods and training parameters, however, reveals that the training approach used in the present study differed considerably. Among those previous studies, the first based strengthening on functional activities performed with either increased resistance or repetitions, while the second utilized an independent home-based program of limited scope and intensity. Most notably, therapeutic activities in both studies were not graded relative to maximal capacity and algorithms for progressive challenge of resistance training were not evident. A third study utilized a uniplanar robot to deliver a high volume of resisted upper-extremity movements, all performed in the transverse plane at table top height
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Similar to the outcomes of the activity-based functional therapies described above, resisted and non-resisted robotic therapy appeared equally effective. However, the peak resistance level presented in the entire six-week robotic protocol was 28 N (~6.3# or 2.9 kg) and an algorithm for systematic progression of the resistive load was not evident. Using grip force as a proxy for upper-extremity strength, normative values for MVIC grip force average 236 N and 383 N for women and men, respectively, aged 60-69
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] indicating that the resistance used in this robotic study involved only 7-10% of maximal capacity. These three studies each concluded no benefit of strengthening for improving function in the hemiparetic upper-extremity. Yet, in all three cases the resistance intervention may have lacked sufficient contrast to the alternative task-specific practice approach. More importantly, in all three cases the intensity of the resistance was most likely insufficient to represent an overload stimulus
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], which therefore readily explains the failure to produce meaningful effects on either strength or function. Because the current study involved dynamic contractions, direct comparison to the resistance levels used in the three earlier studies is not possible. As explained in the description of the therapeutic interventions (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the training prescription in the current study differed from previously conducted studies in three ways: 1) resistance exercise targeted contractions at specific velocities, 2) intensity of the resistance required a high level of the participant&#x02019;s maximal capacity and 3) work load was systematically progressed over the course of the intervention.</p><p>In contrast, a recent study utilized a robotic-type device that offered both static resistance (i.e., isometric) and repetitive arm movements at preset constant velocities (i.e., isovelocity) that required production of a minimum threshold force throughout the full range of motion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Eight weeks of training (24 sessions) using this combination of parameters (i.e., threshold force throughout the movement, dynamic contractions, systematic repetition) in persons six or more months post-stroke produced increases in grip and isometric shoulder strength ranging from 22&#x02013;62% and modest gains on the UE Fugl-Meyer assessment, both outcomes comparable to those revealed in the present study. Perhaps more remarkable were significant improvements in critical parameters of reaching including: movement speed, time-to-peak velocity, minimum jerk and inter-joint coordination suggesting that repetitive training on the basis of key biomechanical parameters facilitates improved coordination of multi-segmental upper-extremity movements.</p></sec><sec><title>Does improved strength relate to improved function?</title><p>Weakness has long been recognized as a prominent characteristic of post-stroke hemiparesis, yet the relationship between increased strength and improved function has been elusive. Despite evidence of beneficial effects of strengthening, evidence to support concurrent effects on functional motor performance remains equivocal
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Accordingly, prevailing clinical perspectives assert that remediation of weakness is a problem distinct from restoration of function and task-specific practice is requisite to promote improved functional performance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Moreover, there is strong evidence to suggest that repetitive task practice drives neural plasticity at the supraspinal level
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Given these assertions the results of the present study are novel. HYBRID produced significant improvements not only in isometric strength, neuromotor activation and power production, but clinical parameters of impairment and functional activities. To our knowledge, only two other studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], have reported improvement in upper-extremity function following resistance training. While we recognize that the HYBRID intervention combined functional task practice and power training, the results reveal larger effects on all measures compared to functional task practice alone. Thus, it appears that functional outcomes are improved by directly addressing the weakness component of post-stroke hemiparesis.</p><p>The majority of studies pertaining to persons post-stroke characterize weakness using isometric force measurements and from these data it has been concluded that improved strength does not contribute to improved function. Because functional task performance is dynamic, characterization of muscle performance under dynamic conditions is more relevant to understanding functional motor impairment. Indeed, intervention-related increases in dynamic torque generation have been revealed in conjunction with absence of improvements in isometric force
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Power represents the capacity to generate force over time (i.e., in a moving joint
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]). Quantification of a dynamic muscle performance parameter, such as power, may thus reveal the elusive link between strength and enhanced functional performance relevant to profoundly motor compromised populations such as post-stroke hemiparesis.</p><p>A stronger relationship has been demonstrated between power and function than between strength and function in older adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The contribution of neuromotor control mechanisms to this relationship is unmistakable. For example, reduced power production in mobility-limited elders is strongly associated with the rate of EMG production
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Conversely, older adults who maintain competitive fitness for power lifting retain maximal motor unit firing rates at levels comparable to healthy young individuals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. High-velocity and/or explosive training increases neuromuscular and mechanical power to a greater extent than strength training and is associated with improved performance on functional tasks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Leveraging these findings we questioned whether the obvious manifestations of neuromotor impairment following stroke would respond similarly to older adults without neuropathology. Additional work in our laboratory, separate from this current study, has demonstrated that upper-extremity power training in isolation (i.e., not combined with FTP) is equally, if not more, effective than FTP for promoting recovery of functional upper-extremity movements
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strength and activation changes</title><p>The early phase (i.e., 2-6 weeks) of resistance training is known to produce neural adaptations which influence the magnitude and organization of motor output (e.g., &#x0201c;central motor drive&#x0201d;) and may include: improvements in cortical excitability, alterations in motor unit recruitment threshold, changes in motor unit firing patterns (e.g., increased recruitment, rate coding, presence of doublets, motor unit synchronization, etc.)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] and alteration in the patterns of force production including an increased rate of force production
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Both the magnitude and time course of increased isometric strength, EMG at MVIC, and joint power in response to HYBRID are consistent with such neural adaptations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>Recent work documents both increased corticospinal excitability and marked reduction of GABA-mediated short intracortical inhibition (SICI) following 4 weeks of dynamic, high-load resistance training
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. While this work provides clear evidence of functional changes in the strength of corticospinal projections following resistance training, reduced SICI may be more relevant to the current study and individuals post-stroke. Corticomotor drive results from the net balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences integrated by the intra-cortical circuits
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Reduced SICI reveals reduced inhibition, resulting from unmasking of silent synapses (e.g., disinhibition) and, potentially, synaptic plasticity at the cortical level
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Excessive inhibition of the ipsilesional hemisphere is recognized following stroke and restoration of the balance of cortical excitability between hemispheres is now acknowledged as a target for motor rehabilitation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. This recent demonstration of cortical disinhibition in response to dynamic, high-load resistance training suggests potential mechanisms mediating the positive neuromechanical and functional outcomes demonstrated in the present study, which can be systematically investigated in future research.</p></sec><sec><title>High-exertion activity does not exacerbate spasticity</title><p>Our results also reveal concurrent improvements in biceps brachii stretch reflex modulation and upper-extremity functional use in response to HYBRID. While clinical assessment using the Ashworth Scale revealed no significant changes following either FTP or HYBRID, both stretch reflex modulation (e.g., hyperreflexia) and passive torque responses (e.g., hypertonia) were significantly improved following HYBRID. Comparable effects were not revealed following FTP.</p><p>We hypothesized that high-intensity activity would not exacerbate spasticity. Unexpectedly, our findings demonstrate that high-intensity motor activity actually induces positive adaptations in reflex modulation that are retained in the absence of additional intervention. Previous work investigating the mechanisms of hyperreflexia has provided evidence for: increased/abnormal motoneuron excitability
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]; increases in activation of dendritic persistent inward currents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]; decreased presynaptic inhibition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]; diffuse changes at the level of spinal circuitry affecting responses in multiple muscles
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], and aberrant depolarizing synaptic drive
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Reductions in aberrant activity, including systematic changes in the onset threshold of reflex activity as observed following HYBRID, can thus be considered positive adaptations in the direction of normal stretch reflex activity. The behavioral manifestations of neural recovery undoubtedly involve the integration of adaptations throughout the neuraxis. When studied concurrently with clinical and functional performance, reflex responses provide a means to monitor these multi-factorial physiological adaptations.</p></sec><sec><title>Active control</title><p>In the present study the experimental, HYBRID, intervention was compared directly to an active control intervention (FTP). The functional task practice program was developed according to principles guiding current clinical practice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] and afforded dose-equivalent matching for treatment time, time on task, and practitioner exposure. Repetitive task practice is argued as the intervention approach of choice for driving functional reorganization of the nervous system post-stroke
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. While intervention-related effects were indeed observed in response to the control intervention, the experimental intervention produced both larger changes and a larger proportion of participants producing clinically significant improvements. In contrast to many investigations of rehabilitation efficacy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>], our approach was to determine whether the experimental intervention would produce greater effects than a standardized treatment developed to meet the putative parameters of current clinical practice. In so doing, we anticipated that the control intervention would reveal treatment-related gains.</p></sec><sec><title>Crossover design</title><p>Our use of a crossover design enabled us to monitor responses to both interventions in the same individuals strengthening our findings regarding differential treatment effects between HYBRID and FTP. Crossover designs offer two clear advantages. First, the influence of confounding covariates and heterogeneity between individuals is reduced because each participant serves as his/her own control. It can be expected that an intervention will produce large and small responses among individuals and similarly, that individuals may be high and low responders. Thus, the crossover can detect differential responses to therapies, should they exist. Second, optimal crossover designs are statistically efficient, thus require fewer subjects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Crossover studies also present challenges, two of which are the potential of order effects and the potential of carry-over between treatments. It is possible that the order in which treatments are administered will affect the outcome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. In the case of rehabilitation, this outcome may be genuine in that one treatment order is more efficacious or may result from a variety of influences. Clinical assessments typically used in rehabilitation are not optimally sensitive or responsive to change and thus are prone to ceiling and floor effects. Compounding these problems of clinical assessment there may be a learning effect or physiological conditioning effect in response to active therapy following a period of relatively sedentary lifestyle. Taken together, these circumstantial influences may contribute to greater responses to the first treatment, regardless of which treatment occurs first. A second concern when using a crossover design is the potential of carry-over between treatments. Carry-over effects are of particular concern in the case of rehabilitation, or exercise, where the intent is to induce persistent changes. In practice, carry-over effects can be avoided with a sufficiently long washout period between treatments. In the worst case, if treatment effects are non-specific and retained through a washout period, a crossover design would yield the obvious result &#x02013; more therapy is better. In the best case, a crossover design can reveal differential effects of intervention and may suggest order effects that would optimize the ordering of activities in rehabilitation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present study, the differential effects of FTP and HYBRID can be appreciated across all levels of measurement, clinical, neuromechanical and neurophysiological. While period effects are suggested in some measures (e.g., Figures
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), they were not consistently revealed and thus contrast with our recent work
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The interventions in the present study shared common elements (i.e., HYBRID involved an abbreviated program of FTP), thus the distinction of ordering may be less clear than when the interventions are contrasting. Regardless, distinct differences in the magnitude of improvements were revealed favoring the HYBRID intervention, which incorporated power training.</p></sec><sec><title>FAS</title><p>Given the underlying rationale of objectively assessing movement function with a standardized battery of timed tasks, one might question the choice of the observational, FAS component of the WMFT. The psychometric properties of the WMFT including validity, reliability and discriminant capacity have been established
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Consideration of the FAS may be an underappreciated aspect of this literature. Since early efforts, both validity and reliability of the FAS component have been tested and reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, early stages of the ExCITE trial reported psychometrics of all aspects of the WMFT, including the FAS, across study sites
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The FAS is equally reliable as the timed portion, and shows a significant negative correlation with performance time
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The fundamental point of both these analyses and inclusion of the FAS as a component of the WMFT is that movement speed and quality of movement are interrelated. Work recently published from our lab
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] used the WMFT to assess recovery of upper-extremity motor function post-stroke. Similar to the current study, we sought to understand the differential effects of two treatment interventions. Of note, the WMFT(time) improved equally in response to both interventions, indicating global improvements in motor function. However, kinematics (3D motion capture) differentiated treatment effects between groups with substantial effect sizes, while effect sizes for WMFT(time) were small to negligible for differences between groups
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Given that the primary question in the current study was to differentiate treatment effects, we elected to report changes in the FAS score. While observational, the FAS score incorporates features of movement captured quantitatively with kinematics. Perhaps more importantly, it affords a measurement instrument readily available to the practicing clinician.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>While results of the present study are encouraging, there are a number of limitations and future investigation is clearly warranted to elaborate these early findings. The small sample size limits both generalizability and the ability to better understand whether differential treatment effects occurred in higher and lower functioning participants. Further, although hand function is clearly a critical element driving use of the upper-extremity, this phase of our investigation targeted the shoulder and elbow for both strengthening and functional effects. Our intention was to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of performing such high-intensity activity in persons post-stroke. With these fundamental issues addressed we are able to refine the intervention for future investigation. All treatments were delivered by one physical therapist. Due to the interpersonal nature of rehabilitation practice, it is likely that an element of our results can be attributed to the positive experience participants enjoyed in receiving a substantial bout of one-on-one treatment from a therapist with whom they enjoyed a good rapport. In future work additional personnel will be involved in an effort to generalize our findings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This efficacy trial of combined functional task practice and power training produced positive, meaningful effects on both clinical and neuromechanical metrics of upper-extremity impairment and function that were both retained and advanced over a 6-month retention period. Importantly, no adverse events were noted and no deleterious consequences, including exacerbation of spasticity, resulted from the high-intensity effort.</p></sec><sec><title>Endnotes</title><p><sup>a</sup>Biodex, Medical Systems, Shirley, New York, 11967-4704 USA.</p><p><sup>b</sup>MA-311, Motion Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA 70816 USA.</p><p><sup>c</sup>Keithly Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH 44139 USA.</p><p><sup>d</sup>The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, 07160-2098 USA.</p><p><sup>e</sup>Elbow flexion: 48-63&#x000ba;, Elbow extension: 67-82&#x000ba;, Shoulder flexion: 15-30&#x000ba;, Shoulder abduction: 33-48&#x000ba;, Shoulder external rotation: 3-18&#x000ba;.
