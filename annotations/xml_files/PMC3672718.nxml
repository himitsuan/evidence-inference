Also, TIMP-1 did not add to the predictive value of <italic>HER2, TOP2A </italic>gene aberrations, or to Ki67 immunoreactivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study could not confirm the predictive value of TIMP-1 immunoreactivity in patients randomized to receive E-CMF versus CMF as adjuvant treatment for primary breast cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A number of clinical studies have clearly indicated the superiority of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy over the combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-flourouracil (CMF) in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, a significant number of anthracycline treated patients will experience disease recurrence, suggesting that their breast cancers contained tumor cells refractory to adjuvant anthracyclines. Moreover, patients receiving an anthracycline may experience significant toxicity during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. With a validated predictive biomarker for anthracycline sensitivity/resistance, it would be possible to direct the toxic adjuvant anthracycline treatment to those patients with the highest likelihood of a treatment benefit while those patients with anthracycline resistant tumors could receive an alternative treatment, for example, a taxane.</p><p>A number of studies have suggested that breast cancer patients with HER2 positive tumors, those amplified and/or overexpressing HER2, are those obtaining the greatest benefit from the addition of an anthracycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Similar data have been presented for the Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (TII&#x003b1;) gene copy number (<italic>TOP2A</italic>) or enzyme, the latter being a target of the anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recently, we have shown that tumor levels of other members of the HER family may be associated with benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, these effects are not substantiated in a recent meta-analysis of multiple trials with data available for HER2 and TOP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Emerging data may suggest that novel markers associated with centromeric enumeration probe for chromosome 17 (CEP17) duplication may identify, in part, those patients with anthracycline responsive cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, increasingly, there is recognition of the complex nature of tumor resistance to chemotherapy and the need for multiple markers to stratify patients according to their likelihood of response to chemotherapy.</p><p>Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) protein as determined by immunhistochemistry is another potential molecular marker for anthracycline benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Preclinical data linked TIMP-1 to protection against chemotherapy-induced inhibition of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and when applying TIMP-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) to tissue microarrays (TMAs) from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) 89D prospective randomized adjuvant trial (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil (CEF) vs CMF), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it was demonstrated that women with breast tumors displaying cancer cell TIMP-1 immunoreactivity had similar benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of the addition of an anthracycline, while women lacking TIMP-1 immunoreactivity in the cancer cells had a significant improved benefit (increased disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)) when receiving combination therapy with an anthracycline as compared with women who received treatment with CMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A subsequent study, including the same DBCG 89D patient cohorts, showed that TIMP-1 immunhistochemistry could be combined with the <italic>HER2 </italic>or <italic>TOP2A </italic>gene copy number forming a biomarker panel which could predict anthracycline benefit in almost double the number of patients as each of these markers could do separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a more recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], including patient samples (TMAs) from the Canadian MA5 study in which patients were randomized to receive either CEF or CMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we reported on a substantial reduction in mortality by CEF compared to CMF in patients with a HER2/TIMP-1 or TOP2A/TIMP-1 responsive profile; however, we could not show a similarly significant reduction in recurrence-free survival events, where a benefit of CEF over CMF was found irrespective of TIMP-1 status.</p><p>To further test the hypothesis that TIMP-1 in combination with either <italic>HER2 </italic>or <italic>TOP2A </italic>copy number can be used to predict benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, including an anthracycline, we assessed TIMP-1 immunoreactivity in TMAs obtained from the BR9601 study in which patients were randomized to receive either epirubicin followed by CMF (E-CMF) or CMF alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. On all samples, data on tumor genetic alterations of <italic>HER2 </italic>and <italic>TOP2A </italic>and protein expression of HER2 and Ki67 were available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The BR9601 study recruited 374 pre- and post-menopausal women with completely excised, histologically confirmed early breast cancer that had a clear indication for adjuvant chemotherapy according to current UK practice, which relies on the Nottingham Prognostic Index for risk stratification.

The patients were randomized between the standard arm of eight cycles of CMF (intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, methotrexate 50 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 21 days, and E-CMF (four cycles of 100 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of epirubicin every 21 days followed by four cycles of the same CMF regimen). The protocol was approved by central and local ethics committees, and each patient provided written informed consent prior to randomization. The primary outcomes of the BR9601 study were relapse free (RFS) and OS (2). Patients were followed for a mean of 5.30 years (range 2.76 to 8.51 years).</p><p>For the current analysis, following approval by the central ethics committee (South East Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee), tissue blocks were retrieved from 321 cases (85.8%) among which 288 cases (77.0%) were applicable for the present study.

It should be mentioned, however, that in the original biomarker study of the BR9601, neither <italic>HER2 </italic>nor <italic>TOP2A </italic>gene aberrations were associated with benefit from anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although only 288 of the original 374 patient samples were available for this study, survival analyses confirmed the benefit from the addition of an anthracycline to CMF versus CMF alone in this subset of patients. Moreover, when analyzing the associations between patient outcome and <italic>HER2 </italic>and <italic>TOP2A </italic>gene copy number and Ki-67 protein in the 288 patients, similar results were obtained as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It thus appears that these 288 patients are representative for the initial study population.</p><p>The TIMP-1 immunostaining was performed using a validated anti-TIMP-1 monoclonal antibody and a strict protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the scoring of TIMP-1 positivity/negativity was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, among the 288 patients 42% were found positive for TIMP-1, which is much less than what has previously been reported: in the DBCG 89D patient cohort 75% of the cases were TIMP-1 positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and a similar distribution between TIMP-1 positivity/negativity was seen in the MA5 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. While TIMP-1 immunoreactivity is often heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and smaller TMA might impact on results, the cores used here were similar to those used in the MA5 study. Also while in the DBCG 89D study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the cores were taken from the invasive front of the tumors while in the BR9601 and MA5 study sampling was focused on tumor rich areas. TIMP-1 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with lower Ki67 immunoreactivity, suggesting that TIMP-1 positive tumors have a lower rate of proliferation, which in turn might result in reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy. Conversely, in the present study in which TIMP-1 positive tumors had a non-significant increased benefit from the E-CMF combination as compared to CMF alone is not explained by increased proliferation of these tumors as evaluated by the Ki67 staining.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the discordant results between the present study and our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] is that the interaction depends on the regimens and/or the patient populations studied. The anthracycline regimens in the DBCG and the BR9601 studies are not identical, with a greater total dose and duration of epirubicin treatment in the DBCG study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] as compared to BR9601 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the DBCG trial recruited only pre-menopausal node-positive women, and patients did not receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. Conversely, in BR9601, both pre- and post-menopausal women were recruited, including 15% node negative tumors, and all ER positive cases were to receive five years of tamoxifen. Another noteworthy disparity between the trials was the higher percentage of ER positive patients recruited into BR9601 (54.9%) compared to the DBCG trial (33.7%). While these differences might explain the discordant results, there is no obvious <italic>a priori </italic>explanation as to why they should.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this validation study of TIMP-1 breast cancer cell immunoreactivity as a predictive biomarker for adjuvant anthracycline benefit did not support the use of this marker to select patients for anthracycline treatment.
