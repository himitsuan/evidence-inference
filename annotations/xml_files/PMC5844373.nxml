Numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of first-line epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over standard chemotherapy in regard to progression-free survival (PFS), response and quality of life for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitive <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;8</xref> Thus, first-line EGFR-TKI is currently the mainstay for systemic therapy of advanced <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant NSCLC.</p><p>However, median PFS with gefitinib monotherapy is 9&#x02013;10 months in these patients and more effective treatment strategies, such as the combination of EGFR-TKIs with other agents, are warranted. Even in this new treatment era, the essential component of lung cancer treatment still tends to be anchored in cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recently, first-line combination of EGFR-TKIs with cytotoxic chemotherapies has been evaluated for patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant NSCLC.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;14</xref> Among them, the North-East Japan Study Group (NEJ) 005/Tokyo Cooperative Oncology Group (TCOG) 0902 study has demonstrated in a primary report that first-line concurrent and sequential alternating combination therapies of gefitinib plus chemotherapy (carboplatin/pemetrexed) offer promising efficacy with predictable toxicities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Although not powered to assess overall survival (OS), the results from this study were striking in that the concurrent regimen, in particular, offered an OS benefit of 42 months. However, OS data were insufficient because of the lack of death events in the primary report.

Patients in the sequential alternating regimen group initially received 8 weeks of gefitinib and then two cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed; this sequential treatment was repeated up to three times (carboplatin/pemetrexed was repeated up to six cycles), followed by alternating gefitinib and pemetrexed maintenance. When patients received four cycles or more of carboplatin/pemetrexed with gefitinib, the induction therapy was considered complete. Continuation of gefitinib alone was permitted when carboplatin/pemetrexed or pemetrexed was terminated.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000313.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" xlink:href="esmoopen-2017-000313supp001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Patients were enrolled from January 2010 to April 2012.

Responses were classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease (PD) or non-evaluable, on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Progression was defined as PD according to RECIST 1.1, clinical progression as judged by the investigator or death from any cause. Progression and clinical response data were all confirmed in an independent central review by members who were not aware of the treatment assignments. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0 was used to grade adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary objective was to select the arm with superior PFS. Secondary endpoints included OS, objective tumour responses and toxicity profiles. This study was not designed to have adequate power to detect a statistically significant difference in efficacy and safety between the two regimens; thus, reported P values are to be interpreted as exploratory.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>PFS was evaluated from the date of randomisation to the date on which progression was first confirmed by the central review assessment. OS was evaluated from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. For patients without any events, data were censored on the last date with non-event status. The probability of PFS or OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves compared using the log-rank test. HRs and 95% CIs were calculated using a Cox proportional-hazards analysis with sex and clinical stage as covariates. The response rate and rate of toxic effects were compared between the two groups with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

Median PFS from this study was promising, being 17.5 months for the concurrent regimen and 15.3 months for the sequential alternating regimen. In regard to the secondary end point of OS, it is noteworthy that median survival times were similar to those of the primary report (41.9 and 30.7 months in the concurrent and sequential alternating regimen groups, respectively; 2-year survival was 31.5% in the concurrent regimen group). In addition, the combination of gefitinib and carboplatin/pemetrexed did not appear to have additive toxicity in a longer follow-up period.</p><p>In this study, despite the identical PFS between the groups, better OS was observed in the concurrent regimen group. Some mechanisms for de novo EGFR-TKI resistance have been reported<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and several patients elicited initial progression with gefitinib monotherapy in the sequential alternating regimen group. The concurrent strategy with cytotoxic agents might circumvent such resistance. In addition, the period of exposure to gefitinib was longer in the concurrent regimen group, partly due to the treatment schedule design. The increased exposure to gefitinib, accompanied by increased pemetrexed maintenance, might lead to long-term clinical benefit with the concurrent regimen.</p><p>We also identified a difference in OS in relation to common <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation types. Patients with Del19 tumours had a longer OS than those with L858R tumours, in both treatment groups. In the Del19 tumour group, OS was longer for patients in the concurrent regimen group than in the sequential alternating regimen group. Since no reports have previously shown PFS or OS differences between&#x000a0;Del19 or L858R populations with gefitinib monotherapy, including our NEJ002 study (data not shown), mutation subtype was not a stratification factor in the current study. These observations warrant further exploration of the biological mechanisms underlying the survival differences associated with these two common <italic>EGFR</italic> genotypes.</p><p>The T790M mutation of <italic>EGFR</italic> is the most common cause of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, being found in up to 50% of patients treated with first-generation and second-generation EGFR-TKIs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;20</xref> The frequency in the emergence of the T790M mutation or other resistance mechanisms might be altered by adding cytotoxic agents to EGFR-TKIs. We have not examined the resistance mechanisms at the time of RECIST progression. However, to examine acquired resistance with sequential gefitinib and cisplatin/pemetrexed combinations, such exploratory research is currently being conducted in parallel with a phase III trial (JCOG1404/WJOG8214L; UMIN000020242).</p><p>Current research is focused on combining novel and targeted therapies to achieve additional benefit in the <italic>EGFR-</italic>mutated NSCLC population. Ongoing clinical trials for these patients include those assessing EGFR-TKIs combined with cytotoxic agents (like the present study),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;14</xref> antiangiogenic agents<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and immune check point inhibitors.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The Japanese JO25567 study has shown promising efficacy of erlotinib and bevacizumab,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and our ongoing NEJ026 trial will provide a phase III evaluation of the erlotinib and bevacizumab combination.</p><p>Recently, third-generation osimertinib monotherapy has demonstrated superior PFS compared with gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy, for patients&#x000a0;with&#x000a0;<italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated NSCLC in the FLAURA study (median PFS 18.9 vs 10.2 months).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Thus, the algorithm for future first-line treatment strategies will dramatically change in this population. After comparing the efficacy and safety profile of the new strategies, including the combination of EGFR-TKIs and cytotoxic agents, and most importantly, carefully examining patients status, there may be several options for optimal first-line treatment in the future.</p><p>As we mentioned in the primary report, one limitation of this study is related to the nature of phase II evaluation; specifically, this study was not designed to formally identify differences in efficacy and safety between the two regimens. Therefore, the findings obtained in this study should not be considered definitive. Second, we have not evaluated the clinical outcome of subsequent treatment in this study cohort, which might affect OS results. However, a substantial proportion of patients had subsequent treatment in both groups and the proportion of patients who received such treatment was similar.</p><p>In conclusion, our updated analysis confirms that first-line gefitinib plus carboplatin/pemetrexed combination improves PFS compared with the reported PFS with gefitinib monotherapy and that the concurrent regimen, in particular, offers an OS benefit of 42 months in the <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated setting. We are now conducting the phase III NEJ009 (UMIN000006340) study to compare the concurrent strategy with standard gefitinib monotherapy in the <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated setting. Together with other ongoing phase III trials, NEJ009 will clarify whether this combination strategy can be incorporated into routine clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all participating patients, their families and the site investigators.
