Dementia care is therefore one of the most important health problems globally. Due to limitations in the efficacy of pharmacological approaches (e.g., <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Food and Drug Administration, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Birks, 2006</xref>), nonpharmacological approaches for people with dementia are receiving considerable attention year by year.</p><p>There are several systematic reviews on non-pharmacological approaches (e.g., <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Livingston, Johnston, Katona, Paton, &#x00026; Lyketsos, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Olazar&#x000e1;n et al., 2010</xref>). These articles concluded that cognitive stimulation (CS) is an approach with a high-grade recommendation. CS describes engagement in a range of activities and discussions aimed at the general enhancement of cognitive functioning (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Clare &#x00026; Woods, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Probably, the most widely used CS program is cognitive stimulation therapy (CST), an evidenced-based brief program that Dr Spector and colleagues in the United Kingdom developed based on their previous systematic review (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al., 1998</xref>). CST consists of 14 sessions that include various topics such as word association, object categorization, discussion of current affairs, and orientation. Each session begins with introductions and warm-up activities. These include the singing of a chosen song and orientation, through referring to an orientation board and discussion of the date and topical issues (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al., 2003</xref>). Targets of the program are people with mild-to-moderate dementia. Although CST is based on complex principles of learning (including multisensory methods, stimulation of language and executive functioning), material is presented in a game-like manner with the aim of subtle, implicit stimulation and avoiding people feeling that they are being &#x02018;taught&#x02019; (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Spector, Orrell, Davies, &#x00026; Woods, 2001</xref>). It builds on principles of person-centered care, emphasizing the importance of treating people with dementia as individual adults, with much to contribute when staff are able to recognize their &#x02018;personhood&#x02019; (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Kitwood, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Woods, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the effects of CST, a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 201 participants showed a significant benefit for the treatment group compared with controls in both cognitive function and quality of life (QOL) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al., 2003</xref>) and was shown to be cost-effective (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Knapp et al., 2006</xref>). The UK government guidelines (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Social Care Institute for Excellence [NICE-SCIE], 2006</xref>) recommend the regular use of CS for mild and moderate dementia. CST much influenced subsequent studies of CS (e.g., <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Eckroth-Bucher &#x00026; Siberski, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Vidovich, Shaw, Flicker, &#x00026; Almeida, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In Japan, no government agencies have created any integrated guideline of nonpharmacological approaches for people with dementia, compatible with the UK guidelines. Instead, the <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Japanese Society of Neurology (2010)</xref> developed such a guideline with the cooperation of six other related Japanese academic societies. This guideline describes that any nonpharmacological approaches have not shown clear effectiveness in Japan. Moreover, the guideline indicates that very few structured studies of nonpharmacological approaches have been conducted in Japan.</p><p>As for research of CS in Japan, two studies examined the cognitive effectiveness of their program (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>). Each study showed that patients treated with CS and donepezil improved significantly more than patients treated with donepezil alone, in nonrandomized controlled studies. However, these studies were individually administrated, focusing on outpatients with very mild dementia in clinical settings. Furthermore, single-blind assessment and intention-to-treat analysis were not conducted in either study.</p><p>In this study, we developed the Japanese version of group CST (CST-J) by translating and following the manual created by <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al. (2003)</xref>. Therefore, we examined the effects of the program for Japanese people with mild-to-moderate dementia in long-term residential care settings with a single-blind, controlled clinical trial and also included the intention-to-treat analysis as per the original UK study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Three residential homes and one nursing home in the Tokyo metropolitan area collaborated in our study.

We asked them not to execute any new interventions or take part in any other research for the duration of this study. Moreover, we requested the institutions to continue with usual group activities while this study ran. These group activities generally included daily short stretching exercises for about 10 minutes and events set such as annual events and birthday parties. Moreover, volunteers irregularly provided some activities such as listening to music, singing, and arts for the residents. In addition, we asked them to keep the allocation blind to the blind assessor (YK).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Assessment measures</title><p>Based on single-blindness, cognition was evaluated by a researcher, and the quality of life (QOL) and mood were rated by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. Additionally, the QOL and mood of the participants were rated by care workers who were not blind but who observed them most directly in daily life.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Cognition</title><p>Cognitive abilities were evaluated using the MMSE (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Folstein, Folstein, &#x00026; McHugh, 1975</xref>) and the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (COGNISTAT; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Northern California Neurobehavioral Group, 1995</xref>). The MMSE is a brief, internationally used test of cognitive function, with a maximum score of 30 points. COGNISTAT is also widely used and consists of 10 subscales: orientation, attention, comprehension, repetition, naming, construction, memory, calculation, similarities, and judgment. We used the Japanese version of COGNISTAT, which was developed and the reliability and validity were established (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda &#x00026; Nakatani, 2004</xref>). The sum score of standardized COGNISTAT subscales ranges from 23 to 105, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Of the two tests, we regarded COGNISTAT as a primary outcome measure of cognitive abilities because it is more complex and multidimensional. In addition, cognitive performance is likely to be influenced by delirium superimposed on dementia. Therefore, cognitive tests were not administered when levels of consciousness tended to be low: the time just after sleeping or eating, or evening time. Moreover, the assessor confirmed if the participants were &#x02018;alert&#x02019; regarding their levels of consciousness as the first check item in COGNISTAT in each cognitive test.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Quality of life (QOL)</title><p>The Quality of Life &#x02013; Alzheimer's Disease scale (QoL-AD; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon, Gibbons, McCurry, &#x00026; Teri, 1999</xref>) and the self-administered health index of EQ-5D (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">EuroQol Group, 1990</xref>) were used as participants' QOL measurements. QoL-AD is a brief, self-reported and disease-specific questionnaire. The scale includes 13 domains with good validity and reliability (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Thorgrimsen et al., 2003</xref>). The total score ranges from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating better functioning. EQ-5D is the internationally used scale of the health-related quality of life. We used the utility scores based on the patterns of each item's score, which range from &#x02212;0.01 to 1.000. A Japanese version of QoL-AD was developed by <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Matsui et al. (2006)</xref>, and the <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Japanese EuroQol Translation Team (1998)</xref> developed the EQ-5D for Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Mood</title><p>To assess mood, we used a face scale that <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Lorish and Maisiak (1986)</xref> developed and <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Tabira et al. (2002)</xref> modified. This scale was originally developed to assess depressive mood (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Lorish &#x00026; Maisiak, 1986</xref>). It was important to assess the mood between pre- and post periods of the treatment because it was recently reported that the prevalence of depressive symptoms in AD patients was 25% (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Van der Mussele et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>On the scale, participants were requested to select one face best expressing their recent general mood among the five faces with different facial expressions. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better functioning. We considered that the face scale was easier for people with dementia to rate visually and intuitively than other scales.</p><p>QOL and mood are subjective, primarily rated by participants. However, it is often difficult for people with dementia to be aware of their own conditions (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Clare, 2008</xref>). For this reason, these scales were compensatorily rated by their care workers as proxies in addition to the participants themselves. Moreover, the rating by care workers has another implication. Particularly in applied behavioral analysis, it is important to check whether any change in participants' due to interventions are recognized by others, which is called &#x02018;social validity&#x02019; (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Wolf, 1978</xref>). We, however, regarded self-rated tests as primary outcome measures for the QOL and mood tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Blindness</title><p>This study was single-blind. An assessor (YK) and the participants were blind regarding the allocation. However, the therapist (first author) and the care workers in the institutions who additionally rated the QOL and mood of the participants were not blind, which was a major limitation in this study.</p><p>After all postintervention assessments, the &#x003ba; value for agreement between the actual allocation and the allocation guessed by the blind assessor was examined to confirm if the blinding was successful.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Program</title><p>It is important for CST-J to be translated and culturally adapted based on some framework. Regarding assessments, particularly in cognitive tests, such frameworks have already begun to be made (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Steis &#x00026; Schrauf, 2009</xref>). Though there have not been such frameworks in non-pharmacological approaches yet, some frameworks should be made, referring to those for assessments. However, it is thought that the process for interventions, particularly regarding activity-based approaches such as CST, is not necessarily the same as that for assessments. One of the reasons is that activities included in the original CST are basically examples based on the theme of each session. Therefore, the process to translate and culturally adapt it for CST-J was made based on the following principles:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Directly translate the original program to Japanese (translation by three experts).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Administer a pilot study to Japanese people with dementia on the basis of the translation.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>Amend unfamiliar and unsuitable sections for the Japanese situation as a result of the pilot study.

Adopt alternative activities that appear to fit to the Japanese situation from the results.</p></list-item></list><p>According to these principles, the original manual was translated into Japanese by the first author, YK, and TA. Based on the translation, a pilot study was administered, which revealed that it was necessary to modify the contents of eight sessions that seemed to be unsuitable as regards Japanese culture. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows such modifications. For instance, crossword puzzles in the 13th session of word games were not very familiar in Japanese culture. Therefore, they were altered to &#x02018;Shiritori,&#x02019; which is a Japanese traditional word-chain game. The modifications were discussed and developed by the translators. The remaining six sessions were unchanged. We confirmed the suitability of the modified contents (e.g., The participants could understand &#x02018;Shiritori&#x02019; more easily than crossword puzzles) through a second pilot study before we completed the CST-J.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Modifications from original program.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Theme</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reasons for modifications</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Modifications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physical games</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(No modification)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sounds</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">One of the original activities was to play music using percussion instruments that most Japanese participants were unfamiliar with.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Beating one's hands to music was added for such participants unfamiliar with play instruments.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Childhood</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(No modification)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Food</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Using replicas of foods seemed childish to Japanese participants.

As a result, the treatment group showed improvements compared with the control group in cognitive function, QOL, and mood, except the self-rated QOL by a single blind assessment. Therefore, it was concluded from this controlled clinical trial that CST shows promising short-term effectiveness for Japanese long-term residential care settings, although the therapy was developed within a British context. This study suggests that sufficient modifications to the content through pilot studies will enable different cultures, such as Japan, to adopt CST.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Comparison with past research</title><p>CST-J showed a significant effect for cognitive function, similar to the original study (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al., 2003</xref>). It is generally thought that some abilities are impaired, but others are still intact in people with dementia. For example, people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) notably show lower episodic memory function from the early stage (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Overman &#x00026; Becker, 2005</xref>), but some other functions such as semantic memory or procedural memory are still intact (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Garrard, Patterson, &#x00026; Hodges., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Mochizuki-Kawai et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, people with dementia have individual differences in degrees of both impaired and intact abilities. It is thought that CST stimulates each individual's intact abilities naturally and repeatedly through social group activities involving fun rather than training for people with more progressed dementia.</p><p>However, the nonsignificant result of the self-rated QoL-AD was different from the significant result of that in the original developmental study of CST (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al., 2003</xref>). We suggest a possible reason for the difference related to Japanese feeling and expression of QOL. For instance, subjective well-being, which is suggested to impact on QOL (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ballesteros, 2007</xref>), has been reported to vary between cultures, with the trend in Japan being quite different from that in the United Kingdom (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Gallup, 2010</xref>). Further studies indicated that Japanese have characteristics such as being self-critical and other-enhancing biases in the interdependent construction of self, which could be related to Japanese low well-being (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Heine &#x00026; Lehman, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Karasawa, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama, Markus, Matsumoto, &#x00026; Norasakkunkit, 1997</xref>). Therefore, it is suggested that therapists need more time and effort to change Japanese participants' QOL scores using a short-term program such as CST-J.</p><p>Interestingly, in this study, the difference of QOL between the treatment group and the control group could be perceived by the care workers as proxies. The EQ-5D was significant and the QoL-AD showed a positive trend when rated by the proxies. The results may have been influenced by evaluative bias, as they were not rated blindly. However, it is important from the point of social validity (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Wolf, 1978</xref>); that is, it seems meaningful that the extent of the effect of the treatment was noticeable for care workers as proxies and observers, because they were nearest to the participants.</p><p>Moreover, the positive change in the self-rated mood suggested that it might be a precursor for changing QOL, even over a limited time period before true QOL changes become apparent. The prevalence of significant depressive symptoms in AD patients is reported to be higher compared with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Van der Mussele et al., 2012</xref>), which indicates that AD patients increasingly have depressive symptoms after onset. If so, it should be clinically significant that participants could improve or keep their daily mood through enjoying CST, which particularly seems to place great importance on social interactions among CS programs.</p><p>CST programs have flexible activities that therapists can select in each session according to participants' opinions or preferences, to some extent. Regarding the original program of CST, an individual version (iCST) is being developed for people for whom it is difficult to attend group activities (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Orrell et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, CST has been applicable to more varied situations. For these reasons, it is important that this program be applied in more countries.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Limitations</title><p>The sample size of our study was small compared with that of the original study, and statistical power was not examined. In addition, the treatment was conducted by one therapist. Therefore, generalization between many therapists was not shown. Regarding the rating of QOL, it is recently indicated that discrepancies in QOL perception between people with dementia and their caregiver should be recognized, particularly in cases of more severe dementia (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>). The reason for the discrepancy and the validity of either rating by the patients themselves and their proxies has not been sufficiently explained yet. Therefore, we should give careful consideration to the result of QOL. Moreover, we should have taken account of unifying time, place, and activities before or after the evaluation of the face scale of mood, because it is generally considered susceptible to chance and confounding variables.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>To date, CST has been confused with CS in Japan, although CST is an original program developed by <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Spector et al. (2003)</xref> and has since been the basis for consequent CS studies. To further complicate the issue, the distinction between CS and CT (cognitive training), which were clearly defined by <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Clare and Woods (2004)</xref>, is not apparent in many Japanese studies. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for Japanese practitioners to understand the background and definitions of the original CST, CS, and CT studies and to clear up the confusion. This study could contribute to a solution for the Japanese problem. Furthermore, the manual of CST-J has been already completed and is available to Japanese practitioners. Because the program was modified for Japanese culture, it will now provide an invaluable resource in a wide range of settings in Japan. It is important that a system of support and supervision for people running CST groups is established. For example, a culturally appropriate CST-J program could be implemented in homes, allowing residents to maintain cognitive functions and mood, enjoying such sessions while at the same time providing measureable indicators for assessors.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Future research</title><p>This program of CST-J should be tested as an RCT. The generalization between different therapists should be examined concurrently with a larger sample size. Given the rapid worldwide increase in people with dementia, as described above, it is most crucial to establish any effective standard programs of daily activities for people with dementia in long-term residential care settings that can be used anywhere in the world. Globally, it will be increasingly important for researchers to more directly exchange ideas and opinions regarding nonpharmacological approaches for people with dementia through common programs by translating and following the manual. CST is accessible in natural long-term residential care settings to even general care staff, as well as to specialized therapists such as psychologists, in terms of the paradigm, materials, and procedure. For this reason, this program may be effective in different countries if it is basically modified according to each culture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CST-J showed improvements in cognitive function, QOL, and mood, except the self-rated QOL, by a single-blind assessment. The nonsignificant result of the self-rated QOL might be influenced by some cultural factors. However, the improvement in QOL rated by the care workers as proxies provides some social validity. Therefore, it can be concluded that CST-J shows promising short-term effectiveness for Japanese long-term residential care settings.</p><p><bold><italic>Declaration of Interests</italic></bold><bold>: None.</bold></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by grants-in-aid for scientific research (19530612, 24653189) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.
