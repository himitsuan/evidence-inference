The increasing prevalence of COPD demands substantial progress to prevent and control the enormous burden of disease. COPD patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) have more severe disease, more frequent exacerbations, more rapid decline of functional capacity and worse outcome <xref rid="pone.0052248-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-OswaldMammosser1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Sims1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, cardiovascular disease mechanisms are gaining importance as potential treatment targets in COPD <xref rid="pone.0052248-Bogaard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Sabit1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Barr1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>So far, only a few trials investigated pulmonary vasodilators in COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0052248-Melot1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Agusti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Stolz1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Rietema1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Unfortunately, pulmonary vasodilators mostly caused an impaired gas exchange and did not improve exercise capacity in COPD. Hereby it is conceivable that non-selective (ventilation-independent) pulmonary vasodilatation and inhibition of hypoxic vasoconstriction increases ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting. Drug application by inhalation might overcome this flaw. Inhaled medications facilitate access to alveolar units, which receive the greatest proportion of ventilation, hence redirecting pulmonary blood flow advantageously to these areas while lowering pulmonary pressures. Two inhaled vasodilators, namely nitric oxide and prostacyclin, have shown to improve oxygenation and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in high V/Q mismatch states <xref rid="pone.0052248-Walmrath1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Zwissler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although nitric oxide has shown beneficial aspects in COPD, its use is inconvenient and the safety of this approach has been considered questionable <xref rid="pone.0052248-Vonbank1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Adnot1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Roger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In contrast, prostacyclin, one of the most powerful pulmonary vasodilators, might play a central role in the development of secondary PH in COPD <xref rid="pone.0052248-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-NanaSinkam1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The selective vasodilative properties of inhaled iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue, were previously investigated in interstitial lung disease <xref rid="pone.0052248-Olschewski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Recently, an open-label study reported an improvement in 6 minute walking distance after iloprost inhalation in COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0052248-Dernaika1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Importantly, V/Q matching improved after iloprost administration. However, to our knowledge, inhaled prostacyclins have not been investigated in a randomized trial in COPD patients.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether inhaled iloprost improves exercise capacity in COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension in a randomized, double-blind fashion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, single center, cross-over trial comparing two doses of inhaled iloprost (10 &#x000b5;g iloprost&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;low dose iloprost and 20 &#x000b5;g iloprost&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;high dose iloprost) and placebo in 16 patients with COPD-associated PH (a detailed description of the methods is provided by the supporting information &#x02013; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052248.s003">Supporting information S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052248.s002">Protocol S1</xref>, CONSORT <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052248.s001">checklist S1</xref>).

Exercise parameters were measured using a telemetric mobile cardiopulmonary exercise test device (Oxycon Mobile&#x000ae; software v. 4.6, VIASYS Healthcare GmbH, W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany). This device consists of an EKG-triggered belt, an oxygen sensor, a facemask with a dead space &#x0003c;30 ml, a flow sensor, a sensor unit to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide, a data storage unit and a data transfer unit with integrated long-range telemetry, allowing real-time monitoring of the data. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, tidal volume, oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were continuously registered. Out of those parameters ventilation (VE), ventilatory reserve, O2 pulse, and ventilatory equivalents (VE/VO2, VE/CO2) were calculated. Before the exercise test there was a resting phase of several minutes. Measures at rest were obtained during a steady state after inhalation before exercise start. 10 minutes after inhalation of iloprost/placebo a six-minute walking test (6MWT) with the mobile exercise equipment was performed according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines <xref rid="pone.0052248-1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. At all times patients had the opportunity to slow the pace, to stop temporarily and to discontinue the test. During the test patients were not encouraged to walk faster or to continue walking. Exercise measures were obtained at peak oxygen uptake. Except for oxygen saturation, where minimal values, and heart rate where maximal values during exercise were analyzed.

Two further patients withdrew informed consent after the first study visit. One of them experienced severe dyspnea after inhalation of the first study medication and denied to undergo any further study procedure. Retrospectively, the episode leading to study interruption followed placebo inhalation. Comprehensive mobile cardiopulmonary exercise testing, including the measures of a six-minute walk test (6MWT), was performed in 13 patients. Three patients were evaluated by standard 6MWTs. Four patients refused repeated arterial punctures and two arterial punctures were not achieved in a timely manner (21% and 4% of all arterial punctures, accordingly). Side-effects included exhaustion, dyspnea, leg weakness and headache (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1), and dizziness (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1) after low dose iloprost.

There was a modest trend to a lower walking distance after low dose iloprost inhalation (estimated difference of the means as compared to placebo (EDOM): &#x02212;12.4 m, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): &#x02212;32.7&#x02013;7.9 m, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.22). High dose iloprost inhalation was similar to placebo in regard to walking distance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.98). Peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2 peak</sub>) during the 6MWT differed significantly over the three study groups (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002). VO<sub>2 peak</sub> was clearly reduced after low dose iloprost inhalation as compared to placebo (EDOM: &#x02212;76 ml/min, 95% CI: &#x02212;122&#x02013;&#x02212;31 ml/min, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002). Noteworthy, inhalation of high dose iloprost seemed not to influence VO<sub>2 peak</sub> (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.92). A similar effect on carbon dioxide production during exercise (VCO<sub>2 exercise</sub>) was observed. Low dose iloprost impaired VCO<sub>2 exercise</sub> (EDOM: &#x02212;70 ml/min, 95% CI: &#x02212;115&#x02013;&#x02212;26 ml/min, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004) whereas high dose iloprost did not alter VCO<sub>2 exercise</sub> (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.90). Oxygen saturation after iloprost inhalation at rest (SpO<sub>2 rest</sub>) was significantly different across the study groups (p&#x0003c;0.001). Low dose iloprost (EDOM: &#x02212;1.0%, 95% CI: &#x02212;1.9&#x02013;&#x02212;0.1%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.035) as well as high dose iloprost (EDOM: &#x02212;2.2%, 95% CI: &#x02212;3.1 &#x02212;1.2%, p&#x0003c;0.001) significantly diminished SpO<sub>2 rest</sub>. Minimal oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2 exercise</sub>) during the 6MWT was similar after placebo and iloprost inhalation (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.17). However, there was a non-significant trend to a lower SpO<sub>2 exercise</sub> after high dose iloprost inhalation (EDOM: &#x02212;1.7%, 95% CI: &#x02212;3.4&#x02013;0.1%; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.064). Oxygen saturation after exercise was similar in patients with low dose iloprost (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.55) and declined in patients with high dose iloprost (EDOM: &#x02212;2.4%, 95% CI: &#x02212;3.4&#x02013;0.0%; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.047), as compared to placebo. Neither the partial pressure of oxygen nor the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was affected by treatment (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.39 and 0.89, accordingly). The partial pressure of carbon dioxide after exercise was elevated in the low dose iloprost group (EDOM: 0.27 kPa, 95% CI: 0.01&#x02013;0.52 kPa; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.040).

O<sub>2</sub> pulse during the 6MWT was similar after iloprost and placebo inhalation (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.16).

First, iloprost inhalation failed to improve six minute walking distance in COPD-associated PH. Second, peak oxygen consumption was not affected or declined after iloprost inhalation. Third, oxygenation at rest deteriorated following both iloprost inhalations.</p><p>The present study is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating aerosolized iloprost in patients with COPD-related PH. Against our hypothesis, inhaled iloprost did not improve exercise capacity. Low dose iloprost even impaired peak oxygen consumption during the 6MWT. However, impaired oxygen uptake did not translate into a reduced walking distance.</p><p>Multiple factors cause exercise intolerance in COPD. Ventilatory components (expiratory flow limitation, dynamic hyperinflation, respiratory muscle dysfunction), gas exchange (hypoxemia, hypercapnia) as well as peripheral factors (locomotor muscle dysfunction, deconditioning) increase energy demands and decrease energy supplies, consequently leading to dyspnea and exercise limitation <xref rid="pone.0052248-Aliverti1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In COPD-associated PH hemodynamics and cardiac output are further elements of poor exercise tolerance. Reasons for the absent exercise improvement are that the key limiting factor was not addressed, the key limiting factor was insufficiently addressed or a simultaneous deterioration of another exercise limiting component.</p><p>A small number of other vasodilators were investigated in COPD so far. Nifedipine caused de-oxygenation in patients with COPD, most likely due to inhibition of hypoxic vasoconstriction <xref rid="pone.0052248-Simonneau1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Kalra1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Bosentan, an endothelin-receptor antagonist worsened oxygenation and quality of life in patients with severe COPD <xref rid="pone.0052248-Stolz1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, three months of sildenafil did not improve exercise capacity in a similar cohort of COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0052248-Rietema1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In a recent study, sildenafil deteriorated oxygenation due to impaired V/Q distributions at rest <xref rid="pone.0052248-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Still, there was a trend to a higher V/Q imbalance during exercise. Nevertheless, a beneficial effect of pulmonary vasodilators on hemodynamics is also in COPD-related PH likely <xref rid="pone.0052248-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052248-Alp1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Probably, most drugs lack selective vasodilative properties and consequently inhibit hypoxic vasoconstriction. Iloprost, a rather large molecule with a short half-life, administered via inhalation, is one of the most selective pulmonary vasodilators available yet. However, similar flaws of inhaled iloprost limit its utilization in COPD.</p><p>Iloprost inhalation clearly impaired oxygenation at rest, both at low and high dose. An enhanced perfusion, similar to the effect reached by other pulmonary vasodilators, most likely caused a worsening of V/Q mismatch. It is unclear, whether selectivity of inhaled iloprost is insufficient or vasodilation <italic>per se</italic> causes impaired V/Q matching in COPD patients at rest. Although not statistically significant, there was a dose dependent decrease in oxygen saturation during exercise. Six minutes after exercise, once more at rest, oxygen saturation was clearly diminished after high dose iloprost inhalation. Thus, it is likely that the effect of iloprost on oxygenation is more pronounced at rest. A similar phenomenon was observed after sildenafil administration <xref rid="pone.0052248-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Noteworthy, beneficial effects of sildenafil on hemodynamics were similar at rest and during exercise.</p><p>Besides V/Q mismatch, other mechanisms impairing oxygenation and exercise capacity are conceivable. The major factor limiting exercise capacity in most COPD patients is ventilation. A minor effect of iloprost on airways could potentially aggravate air trapping, dynamic hyperinflation and compromise exercise tolerance. In accordance, decreased minute ventilation was observed after low dose iloprost inhalation. Our results are in line with results of a previous study, which suggest a significantly lower minute ventilation after iloprost inhalation <xref rid="pone.0052248-Dernaika1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The elevated carbon dioxide levels following iloprost inhalation might either reflect an effect on the ventilatory pump or an impairment of the respiratory drive. Previously, it was reported that iloprost attenuates cerebral blood flow, which might alter ventilatory control <xref rid="pone.0052248-Rosengarten1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>In the current trial, the subgroup of COPD patients who improved in walking distance also improved in peak oxygen consumption. These three patients were characterized by a more restricted diffusion capacity, more dyspnea and a more severe right cardiac strain, while left cardiac function was preserved (data not shown). Thus, patients with a more severe hemodynamic and right cardiac compromise might still benefit. Presumably, ventilatory factors were the main determinants of exercise intolerance in this population. This is also in line with a recent study, suggesting that only COPD patients with severe PH (mPAP&#x02265;40 mmHg) are limited by hemodynamics <xref rid="pone.0052248-Boerrigter1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, the deleterious effects of iloprost on gas exchange and potentially on ventilation have further precluded an exercise improvement.</p><p>A few limitations of the study need to be mentioned. Obtained results are restricted to acute effects of the investigated iloprost dose. Whether other or repeated medication doses would have yielded another outcome is not known. However, our results already prove a clinically relevant deterioration of oxygenation at rest following single iloprost inhalation. Thus, a) indicating that there is a measurable (detrimental) effect of inhaled iloprost in this population; and b) questioning the appropriateness of a long-term trial in respect of short-term safety. The fact that all patients receiving continuous open-label iloprost inhalation following the study end, discontinued therapy within four weeks due to side-effects and/or lack of subjective clinical benefit, supports this notion. Despite careful patient evaluation we cannot rule out that other causes of PH contributed to elevated pulmonary pressures. A considerable number of patients had cardiac comorbidities and six patients had slightly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP&#x02265;15 mmHg). Since left ventricular pressures were not measured it remains uncertain whether this reflects a true elevation <xref rid="pone.0052248-Halpern1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Importantly, all patients had a preserved systolic function. However, a minor cardiac dysfunction at rest might have become more relevant during exercise. Three patients did not achieve current criteria for pulmonary hypertension (mPAP&#x0003e;25 mmHg). Mean pulmonary pressures during exercise in these patients were 49, 58 and 62 mmHg, respectively. Due to a significant number of missing arterial blood gases (25%) interpretation is limited.</p><p>In summary, inhaled iloprost failed to improve exercise capacity in patients with COPD-related PH. Negative effects of inhaled iloprost on oxygenation limit applicability in COPD. Up to date inhaled iloprost cannot be recommended in patients with COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0052248.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
