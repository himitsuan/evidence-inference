While genomic sequencing is useful for genetic disease diagnosis, results are usually reported too late to guide inpatient management. We performed an investigator-initiated, partially blinded, pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial to test the hypothesis that rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) increased the proportion of NICU/PICU infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days. The participants were families with infants aged &#x0003c;4 months in a regional NICU and PICU, with illnesses of unknown etiology. The intervention was trio rWGS. Enrollment from October 2014 to June 2016, and follow-up until November 2016. Of all, 26 female infants, 37 male infants, and 2 infants of undetermined sex were randomized to receive rWGS plus standard genetic tests (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32, cases) or standard genetic tests alone (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33, controls). The study was terminated early due to loss of equipoise: 73% (24) controls received genomic sequencing as standard tests, and 15% (five) controls underwent compassionate cross-over to receive rWGS. Nevertheless, intention to treat analysis showed the rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of enrollment (the primary end-point) to be higher in cases (31%, 10 of 32) than controls (3%, 1 of 33; difference, 28% [95% CI, 10&#x02013;46%];<italic> p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). Among infants enrolled in the first 25 days of life, the rate of neonatal diagnosis was higher in cases (32%, 7 of 22) than controls (0%, 0 of 23; difference, 32% [95% CI, 11&#x02013;53%];<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). Median age at diagnosis (25 days [range 14&#x02013;90] in cases vs. 130 days [range 37&#x02013;451] in controls) and median time to diagnosis (13 days [range 1&#x02013;84] in cases, vs. 107 days [range 21&#x02013;429] in controls) were significantly less in cases than controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). In conclusion, rWGS increased the proportion of NICU/PICU infants who received timely diagnoses of genetic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Whole genome sequencing: Speedier diagnoses in infants</title><p id="Par2">Genetic disorders in critically ill infants can be diagnosed in as little as 26&#x02009;h by rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS). A study led by Stephen F. Kingsmore at the Rady Children&#x02019;s Institute for Genomic Medicine in San Diego and Children&#x02019;s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City compared the time to genetic diagnosis in 65 infants with inherited diseases of unknown cause using rWGS, clinical confirmatory testing and standard genetic tests or standard genetic tests alone. They found that the addition of rWGS including confirmatory testing significantly decreased the time to diagnosis, which in newborns can mean the difference between life and death. Because of the increasing accessibility and decreasing costs of the technology and the critical need for timely and effective intervention in infants with suspected genetic diseases, the authors advocate the use of rWGS as a first-line diagnostic test.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">A premise of pediatric precision medicine is that outcomes are improved by replacement of clinical diagnosis and empiric management with genetic diagnosis and genotype-differentiated treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> The evidence base for pediatric precision medicine is still underdeveloped.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Ill infants are especially in need of precision medicine since genetic diseases are a leading cause of mortality, particularly in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and pediatric intensive care units (PICU).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Among high-cost health care, NICU treatment is one of the most cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Since disease progression can be very rapid in infants, genetic diagnoses must be made quickly to permit consideration of precision interventions in time to decrease morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> For a few genetic diseases, newborn screening has shown early neonatal diagnosis and rapid, precise intervention to dramatically improve outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> The potential expansion to newborn diagnosis for symptomatic infants for all 5000 genetic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> has been made technically possible by the advent of clinical genomic sequencing (whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES), and next-generation sequencing gene panel tests (NGS).

First, since a criterion for enrollment was suspicion by the provider of an underlying genetic disease, nomination was often delayed until a genetic test or consult had been ordered. In such cases, the time of enrollment delayed the study test, rWGS, compared to standard testing; nevertheless, there was still a decreased time to diagnosis with rWGS. Secondly, NSIGHT1 required informed consent from both parents; the logistics and complexity of obtaining informed consent in a NICU or PICU setting are arduous. A follow-on study, NSIGHT2, has started in which enrollment occurs close to the day of NICU or PICU admission (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03211039). This was facilitated by simpler enrollment criteria, requirement of informed consent from a single parent, and limiting eligibility for enrollment to within several days of admission.</p><p id="Par19">Since the current study, clinical rWGS has improved with respect to rate of genetic diagnosis and time to diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In particular, the diagnostic rate has increased through ongoing identification of novel disease genes, improved reference genome sequences, and better identification of disease-causing copy number, repeat expansion, regulatory, splicing and structural variations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> These recent advances were not reflected in the current study. Indeed, in three cases herein, causative chromosomal deletions were detected by microarray but not by rWGS. rWGS has recently also become much more feasible in clinical laboratories due to improved throughput of rapid sequencing instruments (Illumina NovaSeq 6000), and the availability of robust commercial interpretation software. Rapid trio exome sequencing (rWES) has also become feasible, and has demonstrated similar performance to rWGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>: In a recent study, rWES revealed a molecular diagnosis in 51% of infants at an average of 33 days of life, and with a mean turnaround time of 13.0 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> Randomized, controlled studies are needed that compare the diagnostic and clinical utility and cost effectiveness of rWES and rWGS in NICU and PICU infants</p><p id="Par20">NSIGHT1 was terminated early, primarily due to loss of equipoise noted by some nominating clinicians during the study. Some practitioners grew to regard randomization to standard tests alone to be an inferior intervention than standard tests plus trio rWGS. This was associated with seven (21% of controls) requests to cross-over control infants to the rWGS arm following clinician un-blinding, five of which were granted. It was also associated with a higher rate of order of targeted NGS panels, WES or WGS standard genetic tests in controls (43 tests in 24 controls) than cases (22 tests in 17 cases). Standard genomic sequencing tests accounted for 63% (5) of the eight genetic diagnoses in controls. As a result, there was not a significant difference between arms in the total number of genetic diagnoses, a secondary end-point (41% [13] diagnoses among 32 infants in the rWGS arm, 24% (8) of 33 in controls; difference, 16% [95% CI, &#x02212;6 to 39%]; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.19). Future pragmatic RCT designs in genomic medicine will require careful attention to the principle of equipoise and to the rapid evolution of clinical NGS-based testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> The more widespread use of gene panel testing in the NICU during the course of this study was a significant departure from our experience at study conception. Our study was not intended to evaluate the relative diagnostic yield of panel testing over rWGS. Consequently, the study was not powered to evaluate the non-inferiority of panels over rWGS.</p><p id="Par21">The rationale for rWGS in NICU infants is to enable consideration of acute precision interventions in time to decrease morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> In two prior studies of genomic sequencing in infants, genetic diagnoses led to precision medicine that was considered life-saving in 5%, and that avoided major morbidity in 6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> In those studies, early diagnosis (DOL 49) led to greater implementation of precision medicine (65%) than later diagnosis (DOL 374, 39%), particularly with regard to palliative care guidance. As in the current study, assessments of clinical utility were based on actual changes in management, which were limited by clinician experience with genomic medicine and rare genetic diseases. This is a major challenge for NICU and PICU implementation of genomic medicine for rare genetic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> Unfortunately, early termination of the current study resulted in loss in power for the secondary end-points: there were not significant differences in the overall rate of clinical utility of diagnoses, length of admission, rate of diagnosis before discharge, mortality and age at death. The clinical utility of diagnoses and rate of diagnosis before hospital discharge trended towards being higher in the rWGS arm (difference, 19% [95% CI, &#x02212;3 to 42%], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11, and 19% [95% CI, 0&#x02013;38%], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06, respectively). Additional studies are needed to clarify whether shorter time to diagnosis is associated with changes in clinical utility of diagnoses, outcomes, or healthcare utilization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par22">Among infants with suspected genetic diseases in a regional NICU or PICU, the addition of rWGS decreased the time to diagnosis. Since genetic diseases are among the leading cause of death in the NICU and PICU, as well as overall infant mortality, implementation of rWGS is likely to have broad implications for the practice of neonatology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par23">NSIGHT1 tested the a priori hypothesis that rWGS increases the proportion of infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days in a partially blinded, randomized controlled study in a regional NICU and PICU in a tertiary referral children&#x02019;s hospital (Children&#x02019;s Mercy&#x02014;Kansas City, CM-KC)(Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Infants were born at CM-KC or transferred from outside birthing hospitals to CM-KC for intensive care at various ages. Inclusion criteria were infants in the NICU or PICU of age less than four months with illnesses of unknown etiology and one of the following: 1. A genetic test order or genetic consult; 2. A major structural congenital anomaly or at least three minor anomalies; 3. An abnormal laboratory test suggested a genetic disease; or 4. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition. Exclusion criteria were a previously confirmed genetic diagnosis that explained the clinical condition, or features pathognomonic for a chromosomal aberration. The NICU census was reviewed daily for eligible infants by enrollment coordinators. The eligibility criteria did not change after trial commencement. NICU clinicians were notified of eligible infants, who were nominated through a standard form. NICU and PICU clinicians notified families of eligible infants about the study, and enrollment coordinators then approached parents for informed consent. Enrolled infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard, clinically determined tests (controls) or standard clinical tests plus trio (infants and parents where available) rWGS for etiologic diagnosis of infants&#x02019; underlying conditions (cases; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Randomization was performed automatically by the RAND function in Microsoft Excel at enrollment. Parents and clinicians were initially blinded. However, by day ten they were notified of randomization assignment, to minimize parental anxiety and allow consideration of crossover to rWGS. The study design was adaptive, with modification of enrollment prospectively planned following interim data analysis after approximately 2 years of accrual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size determination</title><p id="Par24">The study proposed a sample size of 500 in each group (1000 total), with 82% power to detect a difference of 0.05 in the proportion of molecular diagnoses (using a case diagnosis proportion of 0.1 and a control diagnosis proportion of 0.05; two group, continuity-corrected <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level).
