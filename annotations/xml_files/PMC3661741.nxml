Obesity is associated with attenuated PYY concentrations in both the fasting and the postprandial state (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The response to PYY infusion in obese individuals seems well preserved with increased indices of satiety and a reduction in subsequent energy intake (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), resulting in PYY being identified as a potential therapeutic target for weight management. Altering dietary habits towards a positive energy balance for three weeks is known to alter appetite-regulating hormone concentrations (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and is associated with increased energy intake during the subsequent three day period.</p><p id="P6">Exercise, which can impart a negative energy balance, is also known to alter appetite-regulating hormone concentrations and promote tighter appetite control (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Two recent studies demonstrated that 60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise in healthy, normal-weight individuals increased plasma PYY concentrations, and transiently reduced subjective scores for hunger (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This increase in PYY has also been demonstrated in obese individuals (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) following moderately-intense exercise (60 min of 50 v. 65% VO<sub>2max</sub>). Interestingly however, resistance exercise did not result in any increase in PYY levels (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Research conducted on the acute responses of appetite-related hormones to exercise has only investigated the concentration of these peptides in the immediate post-exercise period (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), without examining the impact throughout the day when additional meals are consumed. Further since our exercise guidelines now encourage exercise to be done in short intermittent bouts throughout the day, gaining an understanding of this type of exercise regimen on appetite-related hormones and satiety throughout the day is critically important.</p><p id="P7">An inverse relationship between insulin and PYY concentrations has been reported. PYY seems to have no effect on baseline insulin, glucose, or glucagon secretion, but decreases glucose-stimulated insulin production (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). More specifically, an increased PYY concentration may inhibit insulin production through a neuropeptide-Y mechanism acting at the level of the pancreatic islets (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A exercise-induced increase in endogenous PYY may contribute to decreased insulin levels and it is possible that exercise intensity or duration may modify this relationship between PYY and insulin levels.</p><p id="P8">The purpose of this study was: 1) to establish the circulating total PYY concentrations and hunger/satiety responses to meal consumption in obese individuals over the course of a 12 h day, 2) to establish how different exercise regimens (continuous v. intermittent exercise) alters total PYY concentration profile and subjective measures of appetite and 3) determine the relationship between total PYY and insulin/glucose concentrations throughout the 12-h study period. It was hypothesized that a continuous bout of exercise would increase total PYY levels to a greater degree than intermittent bouts exercise; however, both exercise conditions were expected to increase total PYY concentration to a greater degree than the sedentary condition. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the increase in circulating total PYY, induced by continuous and intermittent exercise, would correlate with enhanced satiety and reduced hunger, and that these effects would be altered throughout the day. Additionally, it was expected that an inverse correlation between total PYY and insulin concentrations in obese individuals would become stronger following both exercise conditions due to the increase in total PYY and proposed effects on glucose-stimulated insulin production.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Methods and Procedures</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects</title><p id="P9">All subjects signed an informed consent document approved by the Syracuse University Institutional Review Board prior to participating in this study. Young (18&#x02013;35 years old), weight-stable, obese (BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) individuals who were free from gastrointestinal problems and orthopedic limitations to normal walking activity were recruited into this study. Female subjects did not use oral contraceptives, and were consistently tested within the follicular phase (days 2&#x02013;7) of their menstrual cycles to limit potential hormonal effects on appetite regulation. According to self-report, all subjects met general guidelines for moderate physical activity (3&#x02013;5 days per week, approximately 150 minutes total).</p><p id="P10">Twenty-three subjects completed an oral glucose tolerance test (75 g glucose), resting blood pressure measurement (Omron HEM automatic blood pressure monitor - Omron, Kyoto, Japan), and lipid profile (Cholestech LDX -Cholestech Corporation, Hayward, CA).

The total exercise duration (60 min) and intensity (60&#x02013;65% VO<sub>2</sub> peak) were matched between the EX and INT study days. Subjects recorded their dietary intake for the three days prior to the first experimental condition using a food-diary, and were asked to match intake prior to subsequent testing as closely as possible.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Study Protocol</title><p id="P13">At 0700 h, a registered nurse placed a Teflon catheter into the antecubital vein of each subject for blood sampling. Baseline blood samples (10 ml) were drawn prior to the ingestion of the first meal. Each meal (250 kcal) consisted of a mixed, high-carbohydrate liquid (15% protein (PRO), 65% carbohydrate (CHO), 20% fat (FAT)) (Wegmans Nutritional Beverage, Wegmans, Rochester, NY, USA) which was provided every 2 h, so that a total of 1500 kcal was consumed during each study period. Exercise sessions started immediately following baseline blood sampling and consumption of the first meal. Subjects remained sedentary outside of prescribed activity during the EX and INT conditions.</p><p id="P14">Blood samples were drawn from the indwelling catheter at 10 min intervals over the course of each study day. Samples were assayed in duplicate for serum glucose using a commercially available glucose oxidase assay (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO). Additionally, samples were centrifuged (3000 g, 5-minutes, 4&#x000b0;C) and assayed for serum total PYY and insulin concentrations (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using Luminex xMap Technology (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) on a Luminex 100/200 platform (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). All procedures followed manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, with quality controls within expected ranges for each assay. Inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients for insulin and total PYY were 4.0 and 9.5%, and 6.0 and 5.3%, respectively. The lowest limits for detection of this assay were 137 and 14 pg/ml, for insulin and total PYY, respectively. All samples for a given subject were analyzed in the same assay series.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Subjective Hunger and Satiety (VAS scores)</title><p id="P15">Subjects were asked to record an index of their hunger and satiety at 20-minute intervals throughout each study day using a visual analogue scale (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Participants made a mark along a 100 mm line indicating the intensity of their hunger and satiety on a scale of 1&#x02013;100. The VAS for hunger asked &#x02018;How hungry do you feel?&#x02019; and indicators of &#x02018;Not at all hungry&#x02019; and &#x02018;As hungry as I have ever felt&#x02019; were included at the left and right ends of the scale, respectively. Similarly, the satiety VAS asked &#x02018;How full do you feel?&#x02019; with &#x02018;Not at all full&#x02019; and &#x02018;As full as I have ever felt&#x02019; included as scale anchors.

The AUC was calculated for the entire 12-hour period (tAUC) and each 2-h increment starting from first blood sample (iAUC; 0705&#x02013;1905 h). The change (&#x00394;) in total PYY, insulin, and glucose concentrations; as well as VAS scores for hunger and satiety were calculated for each 2 h meal interval by subtracting 2 h baseline from 2 h peak values. Subsequently, percent change values were calculated from these &#x00394; values by dividing the ((peak-baseline)/baseline values)*100. A one-way ANOVA with repeated measures assessed the differences in the baseline, peak, 2 h and 12 h AUC for total serum PYY concentrations and VAS scores between meal conditions. Two-tailed Pearson&#x02019;s correlations between the average magnitude of change, and average percent change between 2 h total PYY concentrations and insulin, glucose, and VAS scores for satiety across study days were calculated. Significance levels in all statistical tests was accepted at &#x003b1;=0.05.

This research however, has typically focused on continuous exercise, and monitored appetite and appetite-regulating hormones during the period immediately (1&#x02013;3 h) post-exercise (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This study extends these findings by examining the effects of exercise on appetite-related hormones and satiety beyond the first few hours of the post-exercise period and extending these observations out over 12 h. This study reports for the first time that the addition of a one hour morning exercise (EX) or intermittent 5-minute exercise bouts every hour throughout the day (INT) does not alter total PYY concentrations over the course of a 12 h day in obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose. However the intermittent exercise resulted in lower perceived hunger and increased satiety in the mid-afternoon hours, which did not occur in the sedentary or exercise condition.</p><p id="P25">Despite no change in the hormonal responses, intermittent exercise was more effective in reducing the perception of hunger as the day progressed with a robust attenuation of hunger perception (32.3%) demonstrated between the INT and EX conditions between 1500&#x02013;1700 h, and a 24.6 and 26.9% reduction in hunger between 1700&#x02013;1900 h when compared to the SED and EX conditions, respectively. Intermittent activity also improved the perception of satiety, with increased indices of meal-induced satiety reported in the INT compared to the EX and SED conditions. Between 1500&#x02013;1700 h, intermittent exercise resulted in a 25.7% increase in satiety when compared to EX. Similarly, in the 2 h period between 1700&#x02013;1900 h, the perceived scores for satiety in the EX condition were 42.6 and 24.8% lower than the SED and INT conditions, respectively. The current findings demonstrate little to no effect of continuous exercise (EX) on appetite over the course of a twelve hour day, in agreement with a previous review (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, there is evidence of an accumulating effect of intermittent exercise (INT) on appetite, independent of changes in total PYY, which may result in sustained appetite modulation over the course of the day. Intermittent exercise therefore presents a promising alternative for weight maintenance and weight loss.</p><p id="P26">Previous studies have demonstrated that prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise increases PYY concentrations (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), though this has not been demonstrated exclusively (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and these changes are often elevated transiently (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). While total PYY was elevated immediately following the morning exercise bout (EX) as compared to the SED (11.9%) and INT conditions (19.3%), this effect had disappeared by 2 h (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The 12 and 2 h AUC for total PYY concentrations were not different between conditions, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p id="P27">While Martins et al (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) did not report differences between VAS measures of hunger and satiety in response to a 1 h bout of moderate exercise (65% of max heart rate), their measurements were restricted to a 3 h period after the exercise bout. Likewise we did not observe any changes in hunger or satiety in the immediate 3-h period following the acute, continuous exercise bout. While one-hour of moderate-intensity exercise at the beginning of the day did not result in changes in the hunger and satiety perception in our obese subjects with impaired fasting glucose, intermittent exercise participation resulted in a decreased hunger perception (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and increased satiety later in the day (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This finding is surprising, as previous work has demonstrated that intermittent aerobic exercise results in a higher excess post-exercise oxygen consumption and energy expenditure than an intensity- and duration-matched single bout of aerobic exercise (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The potential for an exercise intervention that increases overall daily energy expenditure, while decreasing hunger and increasing satiety, is promising.</p><p id="P28">An inverse relationship was confirmed between insulin and total PYY concentrations over the course of the day during the EX condition; where an increase in total PYY concentration was associated with an attenuated increase in insulin concentrations. This was not demonstrated in the SED and INT conditions. This inverse relationship during the EX condition occurred despite no differences in the indices of total PYY (12 h or 2h AUC, &#x00394; or percent change per meal) between the study conditions. The continuous physiological stimulus of the 1 h morning exercise bout may have been sufficient in increasing the total PYY concentration or action which may have inhibited insulin release. A similar strengthening of the relationship between glucose-stimulated insulin production and PYY has been demonstrated in older, obese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance following a strict, twelve-week exercise intervention (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It was postulated that this response was due to the incretin effect of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Additional investigations in obese individuals concerning the relationship between PYY and insulin levels with exercise are needed to better understand these phenomena. In addition, the complex milieu of appetite hormones including the redundant physiological mediators and pathways which control of appetite regulation (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), both at rest and during exercise, warrant further study.</p><p id="P29">The strength of this project is that we have extended previous research by frequently sampling blood over a 12 h period providing insight into the hormonal profile to subsequent meals, and not just the meal immediately following the exercise bout. This study design also allowed us to examine the effect of intermittent exercise throughout the day which is now being widely prescribed. Discrepancies in our findings from the previous report can be attributed to the extended period of sampling done in the present study. The six-meal, 1500 kcal diet utilized in this project was selected since this would approximate the energy needs throughout the study days, and mimics the frequent snacking often observed in the general public. This 1500 kcal diet represented a reasonable caloric intake for adults considering we did not include a dinner time meal. It is possible that subjects were in a slight caloric deficit on the exercise days, which may have somewhat influenced the subjective hunger and satiety responses. The decision to adopt a study design where participants consumed a meal immediately prior to exercise participation in the EX and INT conditions was imperative in order to prevent an extreme energy deficit following the 12 h fast. Previous work has demonstrated that a large energy deficit can potentially affect insulin concentrations and appetite perception (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and may in turn influence insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="P30">A limitation of the present study was that total PYY was measured rather than PYY<sub>3-36</sub>. Much of the previous research concerned with circulating PYY has reported total PYY levels using assays which detect both the PYY<sub>1-36</sub> and PYY<sub>3-36</sub> (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). PYY<sub>3-36</sub> is the predominant form both in the fed and fasted states and in lean and obese subjects (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), thus it is possible that we may have noted different findings if we had measured PYY<sub>3-36</sub> only. However, since both PYY<sub>1-36</sub> and PYY<sub>3-36</sub> are considered physiologically relevant to appetite regulation, particularly over the course of an entire day, the decision was made to measure total PYY (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, total PYY concentration was not affected in obese individuals following either a 1 h bout of exercise or multiple short bouts of exercise over a 12-h time period. However, short bouts of exercise over the course of the day improved subjective measures of appetite; a finding which is particularly significant considering that intermittent exercise is expected to have resulted in increased energy expenditure over the SED condition. Future work should examine whether short, intermittent exercise bouts throughout the day will lead to decreased food intake over the long-term, and assist with weight management in obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><p>This project was supported in part by NIH grant R21DK063179.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2" fn-type="conflict"><p>There were no conflicts of interest
