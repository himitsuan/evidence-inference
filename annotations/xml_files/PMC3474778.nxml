Because previous attempts to blind the filter have been unsuccessful, we also assessed weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ) as an objective measure of diarrhea impact. Filter use was high, with 96% (596/620) of household visits meeting the criteria for users.

The 33 million PLHIV worldwide - including almost 1 million living in Zambia <xref rid="pone.0046548-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> - are especially vulnerable to diarrheal disease caused by opportunistic infections from waterborne pathogens, such as <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. <xref rid="pone.0046548-Mermin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Diarrheal disease may lead to intestinal malabsorption so that PLHIV on antiretrovirals (ARVs) are not acquiring their essential nutrients and therapeutic dosages of medications <xref rid="pone.0046548-Isaac1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Bushen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Brantley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, diarrheal disease and unsafe drinking water may be particularly debilitating for children born to HIV-positive mothers. Young children born to HIV-positive mothers are at greater risk of mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition, which may be aggravated by enteric infection <xref rid="pone.0046548-Filteau1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Makasa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Omari1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Safe water is critical for HIV-positive mothers who choose to replacement feed in order to prevent transmission of the virus via breast milk; &#x0201c;safe water and sanitation&#x0201d; is the first condition for replacement feeding in the new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines <xref rid="pone.0046548-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Current WHO guidelines for infant feeding for HIV-positive women recommend that virtually all women breastfeed their children for up to 2 years while either the mother or child is on ARVs <xref rid="pone.0046548-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; the risks of diarrheal disease and malnutrition outweigh the risks of HIV transmission in the majority of low-income settings. Even for mothers who choose to breastfeed, infants may be exposed to waterborne pathogens; exclusive breastfeeding is less common among HIV-positive mothers <xref rid="pone.0046548-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and water treatment has been found to reduce diarrhea even among breastfed children <xref rid="pone.0046548-Chiller1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Finally, young children who do contract the HIV virus will be more susceptible to water-related pathogens because of a weakened immune system and may particularly benefit from improved environmental conditions.</p><p>Our previous research in Zambia found that children &#x0003c;2 years born to HIV-positive mothers are particularly at risk of diarrheal disease. In our cross-sectional study, 26% of children &#x0003c;2 years had diarrhea in the past week and bacterial contamination of drinking water was found in 70% of households <xref rid="pone.0046548-Peletz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Children were more likely to have diarrhea if they had been given water in the past two days, suggesting that diarrheal disease may be at least partially attributable to unsafe drinking water. Additionally, diarrhea in children was significantly associated with mother's diarrhea, which is of particular concern in HIV-affected areas; mothers with HIV may be more likely to have diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0046548-Mermin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and consequently more likely to pass diarrhea onto their children. Therefore, for children born to HIV-positive mothers in low-income settings, water quality interventions may be particularly critical.</p><p>Improving household drinking water quality through household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) has been shown to have the potential to significantly reduce diarrheal disease <xref rid="pone.0046548-Waddington1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Clasen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Fewtrell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. International organizations including USAID, the World Bank, and WHO have recently called for an integration of water and sanitation activities in HIV/AIDS programs <xref rid="pone.0046548-USAID1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-USAID2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-WSP1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Water1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and the number of programs including HWTS for PLHIV is increasing <xref rid="pone.0046548-Lugada1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Kangamba1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Lockwood1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Potgieter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Colindres1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>However, despite these programs, there is relatively little evidence demonstrating the health impact or examining use of HWTS interventions for PLHIV. Only one study has assessed the health impact of HWTS for PLHIV in a low-income setting in the form of a randomized, controlled trial. This trial in Uganda found that PLHIV with a household chlorination technology had 25% fewer diarrhea episodes and 33% fewer days with diarrhea compared to the control group, though diarrhea reductions were not significant for children under five <xref rid="pone.0046548-Lule1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Other observational studies of household chlorination interventions have found significant associations with diarrhea reductions in Nigeria among adults with HIV/AIDS <xref rid="pone.0046548-Barzilay1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and in Kenya among infants born to HIV-positive mothers <xref rid="pone.0046548-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, these studies and the majority of HWTS programs for PLHIV have been in the form of chlorination products <xref rid="pone.0046548-PSI1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-CDC1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-US1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, which do not inactivate or remove the full array of waterborne pathogens (such as <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp.) unless combined with other treatment mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0046548-Korich1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, there are questions about whether HWTS interventions are used correctly and consistently over an extended period of time <xref rid="pone.0046548-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>; this study is primarily designed to examine HWTS use, which is vital to the success of HWTS programs.</p><p>We undertook a randomized controlled trial to assess a gravity water filter combined with local jerry cans for safe storage. Specifically, we examined 1) the use of the HWTS, both for children &#x0003c;2 years and all household members, 2) the microbiological performance of the HWTS intervention, measured as thermotolerant (fecal) coliforms (TTC), a well-established WHO indicator organism for fecal contamination <xref rid="pone.0046548-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and 3) the impact of the intervention on the longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea among children &#x0003c;2 years and all household members, measured both as reported by the primary caretaker and by the weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) of children &#x0003c;2 years &#x02014;a potential measure for reported diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0046548-Schmidt2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046548.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046548.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Sample Size</title><p>A randomized, controlled trial was designed to assess use, microbiological performance, and health impact of a household filtration intervention over 1 year. This study followed an open (non-blinded) design because previous attempts to blind the same intervention (LifeStraw Family filter) in the Congo were unsuccessful; the &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; provided to control households removed approximately 1 log (90%) of fecal contamination, potentially due to the formation of a biofilm, and the authors concluded that blinding this filter is not likely to be possible <xref rid="pone.0046548-Boisson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We estimated a sample size of 50 households per arm (100 total) would allow us to estimate use with a precision of at least &#x000b1;15% with 20% loss to follow-up, assuming at least 70% use <xref rid="pone.0046548-Boisson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Additionally, 10 HIV-negative mothers and their households were included in each arm (20 total, an additional 20% of households). This figure represents a balance between the need to reduce potential stigma of participation and the cost and inconvenience to additional participants. Because recruitment occurred over an eight month period, the length of possible follow-up depended on the time of enrollment, up to 12 months. With this sample size, we had 80% power to detect a 40% reduction in diarrhea prevalence.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Location</title><p>From our previous work <xref rid="pone.0046548-Peletz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, Chongwe District, Zambia was identified for this study based on the lack of piped water supply systems, inadequate water quality, and presence of active health clinics. The project sites included two neighboring compounds, Kasisi and Ngwerere in Chongwe District, both approximately 30 min&#x02013;1 hour from central Lusaka, Zambia. Neither Kasisi nor Ngwerere were serviced by municipal piped water systems at the time of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participant Eligibility and Enrollment</title><p>Children &#x0003c;2 years born to eligible HIV-positive mothers were targeted by recruiting and enrolling their mothers. Women were eligible to participate in the trial if they (i) had a child aged 6 to 12 months at the beginning of the trial, (ii) reported that they were HIV-positive (or HIV-negative) confirmed with antenatal clinic records and willing to disclose their status to our study team, and (iii) resided in a household located within the catchment areas of the Ngwerere or Kasisi health clinics in Chongwe district, Zambia and did not plan to move in the next 12 months. Health clinic staff identified potentially eligible women consecutively through under-five clinics and ART programs at their respective health clinics and referred them to our field team. HIV status of the children &#x0003c;2 years was recorded as reported by the mother.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>Each intervention household received one LifeStraw Family filter and two 5-L safe storage containers. The LifeStraw Family is a novel HWTS filtration technology developed by Vestergaard-Frandsen SA that uses ultrafiltration in the form of a hollow-fiber cartridge to remove pathogens from drinking water <xref rid="pone.0046548-Clasen2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. To operate, untreated (influent) water is poured into a 2.5 L container, flows down a 1 m long tube designed to provide head pressure, and through the ulrafiltration cartridge where is it dispensed via tap (effluent). In addition to the filter, we provided two locally-procured 5-L jerry cans (Merco Ltd, Ndola, Zambia) for safely storing water following treatment. Households that were allocated to the intervention group received the filter and training on use and maintenance by our fieldworkers, who were previously trained by the filter manufacturer. Households allocated to the control group were instructed to continue usual practices throughout the study and were allocated filters and storage containers with subsequent training at the end of the study in August 2011.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Baseline survey and randomization</title><p>At enrollment, baseline data were collected on demographics, sanitation facilities, hygiene practices, water sources and treatment practices, and feeding practices for children &#x0003c;2 years. For each household, baseline water samples were collected from drinking water sources and stored drinking water in the home. Households were randomly allocated using a computer random number generator to either a) the intervention group receiving the LifeStraw Family filter and storage containers, or b) the control group. The randomization was stratified by maternal HIV-status and catchment area (either Ngwerere or Kasisi) in blocks of 8 maximum. The randomization was conducted by the trial manager (RP) who was not involved in the enrollment of participants, and fieldworkers were not involved in the randomization.</p><p>Participants were recruited from April&#x02013;December 2010, and followed for 7&#x02013;12 months depending on time of recruitment. Households were considered to have completed the trial that continued until July 2011, regardless of the time of recruitment; total possible follow-up visits were calculated based on the time from enrollment until July 2011. Households were visited monthly; visits were unannounced and the field team made a repeat visit if the mother was not at home. Although we cannot rule out the potential of courtesy bias assessments of compliance, we took steps to minimize this by making all visits unannounced and sampling water quality, an objective measure.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Use</title><p>Households were followed monthly to obtain information on filter use and acceptability. Households were classified as &#x0201c;reported users&#x0201d; if 1) the filter was observed in household at the time of visit, 2) the storage vessel contained water reported to be treated at the time of visit, and 3) the respondent reported using the filter on the day of or day prior to the day of visit. Households were classified as &#x0201c;confirmed users&#x0201d; if, in addition to these three criteria, there was at least a 1 log<sub>10</sub> TTC improvement in their stored household water over their unfiltered water, or stored water quality was &#x0003c;10 TTC/100 mL. &#x0201c;Exclusive use&#x0201d; was defined as not drinking any unfiltered water in the day of or day prior to the interview as reported by the mother. The acceptability of the technology was evaluated through monthly household surveys.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Water Quality</title><p>Water samples were collected during monthly visits. For the stored drinking water, the respondent was asked if there was any drinking water in the house and samples were collected from the vessel that the householder identified for drinking. For control households, only stored drinking water was collected. For intervention households, water samples were collected of i) unfiltered water stored in the home (influent water), ii) filtered water immediately after filtration (effluent water), and iii) stored water that the household reported to be filtered, if available. Samples (125-mL) were collected in sterile Whirl-Pak&#x02122; Bags (Nasco International, Fort Atikinson, WI, USA) containing a tablet of sodium thiosulfate to neutralize any disinfectant, placed on ice, and processed within 4 hours of collection to assess levels of TTC/100 mL at the University Teaching Hospital, Zambia. Microbiological assessment was performed using a membrane filtration method with membrane lauryl suphate medium using using a DelAgua field incubator (Robens Institute, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surry, UK) in accordance with the Standard <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0046548-Eaton1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. After piloting the assay procedures, we elected to use full 100 ml samples for filtered and filtered &#x00026; stored samples (intervention households) and 10-fold diluted samples for unfiltered samples (intervention and control households) to minimize the number of samples that yielded plates with colonies that were too numerous to count (TNTC). Where plates were TNTC, we ascribed a value of 500 TTC to such plates; this is a conservative estimate of the upper detection limit considering up to 1500 TTC were counted per plate. Baseline samples were also tested for free and total chlorine residuals using a Hach color-wheel test kit (Hach Company, Loveland, CO, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Diarrhea Longitudinal Prevalence</title><p>At all monthly visits, the mother was asked whether each household member experienced any diarrhea in the past 7 days.

During weight measurements, children were only wearing a minimum of light clothing without shoes. Children were weighed a minimum of twice during every visit to verify the weight measurement; if the two measurements were not equal (particularly from child movement), the child was weighed a third time and the confirmed weight was recorded. Date of birth was verified on the child's health card to calculate WAZ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>Data were double-entered into EpiData 3.1 and analyzed using Stata 12. The analysis plan was finalized before the data were examined. WAZ scores were calculated using the WHO growth reference data. Socioeconomic status was measured using an asset index created by combining data on household possessions and characteristics based on asset questionnaires used in the Zambia Demographic and Health Survey <xref rid="pone.0046548-Gwatkin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis in order to estimate the effectiveness of supplying households with the intervention, regardless of filter use. The data from households with HIV-negative mothers were included in all analyses unless stated otherwise.</p><p>To assess acceptability and filter use, we tabulated data for all visits combined, and separately for the &#x02018;final&#x02019; visit, defined as the final follow-up visit for households that completed the trial. To assess the effect of the intervention on water quality, TTC counts during follow-up were compared using random effects linear regression to account for repeated observations within households. TTC counts were normalized with log<sub>10</sub> transformations; a value of 1 was added to all TTC levels before transformation to account for samples with TTC values of zero, log<sub>10</sub>(TTC level+1). Microbiological filter performance was calculated as the difference of the log of the influent concentration and log of the effluent concentration.

Water quality results were transformed to log<sub>10</sub>(TTC level+1), to account for samples with TTC values of zero. Adjusted analyses controlled for age and trial arm, since both were strongly associated with diarrhea. Predicted probabilities of diarrhea from the unadjusted and adjusted models were calculated at fixed values of log10 TTC and plotted.</p><p>We used fractional polynomials to examine the shape of the relationship of water quality (log<sub>10</sub> TTC) with log diarrhea prevalence, using a set of defined powers (&#x02212;2, &#x02212;1, &#x02212;0.5, 0.5, 1, 2 and ln(x)) and a maximum of two power terms in the model. Models were adjusted for intervention arm. The differences in model deviances were compared; the linear model was used if the improvement in fit was not statistically significant at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>The relationship between water quality and WAZ was assessed with random effects linear regression accounting for repeated measures and adjusted for baseline WAZ; adjusting for baseline WAZ accounts for genetic variability and events prior to the intervention. To examine the effect of the intervention on mortality, we used a Cox Proportional hazard model to estimate mortality rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University of Zambia and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01116908). Participants were provided with verbal and printed details of the study in the local language; informed, written consent was obtained from all participating mothers for their respective households. Measures were taken to ensure confidentiality for all participants. If members of participating households were found to be in need of health care during the household visits, they were referred to health clinics.

The large difference in exclusive use may be attributable to the fact that in the Congo trial households were advised to only use water directly from the filter and were not provided with safe storage containers, implying that safe storage containers may be essential to ensure exclusive use of HWTS. At the same time, there is little evidence that the practice of storing water after it is filtered adversely impacted drinking water quality in the home.</p><p>Diarrhea reductions in our study exceeded the 35&#x02013;44% commonly found by HWTS <xref rid="pone.0046548-Waddington1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Clasen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Fewtrell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Diarrhea reductions may have been particularly high among our population because of the increased risk of water-related pathogens in households with PLHIV <xref rid="pone.0046548-Peletz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Central1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and the performance of the intervention in removing the full array of microbial pathogens. Furthermore, use and exclusive use was high among our population, and there is an increased health impact among high-frequency HWTS users <xref rid="pone.0046548-Barzilay1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Arnold2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, the intervention did not result in significant reductions in persistent diarrhea among children &#x0003c;2 years or all household members. Previous research has found that household water treatment may be more effective in reducing shorter episodes of diarrhea compared to persistent diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0046548-Reller1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Water quality showed a positive trend with reported diarrhea, both for children &#x0003c;2 years and all household members. Interventions that improve water quality are known to reduce diarrheal disease <xref rid="pone.0046548-Clasen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Gundry1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, though the relationship between drinking water quality bacterial indicators and general diarrheal disease is not well established <xref rid="pone.0046548-Gundry1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. An observational study in Tanzania found a relationship between health and fecal contamination on hands but not in stored drinking water <xref rid="pone.0046548-Pickering1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, though a previous trial of a household ceramic filter in Colombia found a significant relationship between water quality and diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0046548-Clasen3" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. In our study, the suggestion of positive trend between diarrhea and water quality supports our finding that the water quality intervention resulted in a reduction in diarrheal disease; presumably participants would be unable to base reported diarrhea on actual TTC levels in their water considering they were not aware of exact TTC levels.</p><p>Though we did not find an impact of the intervention on WAZ, we did detect a significant association between WAZ and reported diarrhea. The lack of difference in WAZ between our trial arms despite the reduction in reported diarrhea and the association between WAZ and reported diarrhea merits further discussion. It is possible that reported diarrhea data may be of questionable reliability; open trial designs of self-reported outcomes are subject to bias <xref rid="pone.0046548-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. We cannot entirely rule out or assess the effects of biased self-reporting of diarrhea. However, the relationship between diarrhea and water quality is well-established and is the basis for international drinking water quality standards <xref rid="pone.0046548-WHO4" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The fact that we observed this same relationship here suggests that our results are not solely attributable to bias self-report. Moreover, we found no association between WAZ and water quality; given that the intervention may only influence WAZ via water quality, the intervention may not be appropriate to improve WAZ. Furthermore, diarrhea and WAZ may be associated primarily due to persistent diarrhea. We did not find a significant reduction in persistent diarrhea in children &#x0003c;2 years (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.26) and a previous trial in Guatemala found that a HWTS intervention mostly prevented short episodes <xref rid="pone.0046548-Reller1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Schmidt3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Therefore, the diarrhea experienced by our intervention arm may have been more persistent compared to the intervention group. This is supported by a stronger relationship between diarrhea and WAZ in the intervention arm than in the control arm (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003 for interaction); persistent diarrhea is known to impair growth <xref rid="pone.0046548-WHO3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Though we cannot entirely discount the possibility of reporting bias, WAZ may not be an appropriate measure for diarrhea in HWTS trials, though further investigation is needed.</p><p>There are some limitations to our study. First, the reliance on self-reported data for diarrhea disease in a non-blinded HWTS intervention trial has previously been criticized <xref rid="pone.0046548-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046548-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, the suggestion of positive trend between water quality and diarrhea suggests that most of the self-reported diarrhea may be verifiable. Second, baseline diarrhea prevalence was not evenly distributed between our trial arms for all household members, though this would only result in a conservative estimate of the intervention effect and baseline diarrhea may not be predictive of diarrhea during the intervention period <xref rid="pone.0046548-Schmidt3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Third, because we recruited from health clinics, we were not capturing the most vulnerable population that does not have access to health facilities or is too sick to access these services. Finally, our study was conducted in Chongwe District, Zambia and may not be generalizable to other locations with different water quality and practices.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our findings indicate that HWTS may be particularly beneficial among HIV-positive mothers with young children. Though our study was not designed to examine mortality of children &#x0003c;2 years, our study results and previous research <xref rid="pone.0046548-Crump1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> suggest that HWTS may have the potential to reduce mortality in young children. The effect of HWTS on mortality of young children needs to be further explored in the form of a full randomized, controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0046548.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
