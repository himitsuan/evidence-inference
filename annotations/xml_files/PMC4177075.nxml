Since the pros and cons of self-testing are unclear and neutral information on self-testing is lacking, two decision aids (DAs) on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes were developed to support consumers in making an informed choice that is in line with their personal values. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the DAs on the intention to self-test for cholesterol or diabetes, as well as socio-cognitive determinants of that intention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>1137 people of an internet panel with an intention to use a diagnostic self-test for cholesterol or diabetes were enrolled in a web-based randomized controlled trial consisting of four groups: a cholesterol intervention and control group and a diabetes intervention and control group. The study was conducted in September and October 2011. The intervention groups received an interactive online DA with general information on self-testing and test-specific information on cholesterol or diabetes self-testing, whereas the control groups received a limited information sheet with general information on self-testing. The intention to use a self-test for cholesterol or diabetes and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, cues to action, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and ambivalence towards self-testing were assessed directly after being exposed to the intervention or control information.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Follow-up measurement was completed by 922 people. Analyses showed a significant group by intention at baseline interaction effect within the diabetes condition. Further exploration of this interaction showed that a main group-effect was only observed among maybe-intenders; intention of participants in the intervention group did not change between baseline and follow-up, while intention slightly increased in the control group. We observed a significant main effect of group on cues to action in the cholesterol condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found limited effects of the DAs on intention and its determinants. Although the time spent on the DAs was limited, we might assume that our DAs contain neutral information on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes. By implementing our DAs in real life among people who probably or definitely intend to use a self-test and by assessing weblog files, we might be able to determine the effectiveness of our DAs on self-test behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Dutch trial register</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3149">NTR3149</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Diagnostic self-tests on body materials testing for conditions such as diabetes or elevated cholesterol levels are widely available to the general public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Home self-tests can be bought in drugstores or via the Internet and can be used without the need to consult a health professional first. In home self-testing, the consumer is responsible for the execution of the test, the interpretation of the test result, and the follow-up behaviour based on this result. Diagnostic self-tests on body materials are often used; 18% of respondents participating in an online survey in the Netherlands had ever used a self-test in 2008. In total, 44% of these self-tests were considered to be home-tests whereas the remaining 56% were conducted as so-called &#x02018;street corner&#x02019;, &#x02018;direct access&#x02019; or &#x02018;home collect&#x02019; tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Self-diagnosis and therefore self-testing can be seen as a tool to stimulate autonomy and self-management as they can be used to take responsibility for one&#x02019;s own health. However, since self-testing is a relatively new area in disease prevention and is still in a state of flux, the consequences of self-testing for individuals and society are currently unclear. Self-testing can be seen as a positive development i.e. self-testing may increase testing-rates resulting in more timely diagnosis and treatment, and self-testing can be used in the privacy of one&#x02019;s home and is therefore convenient. However, self-testing might have negative consequences as well, as self-tests may be unreliable and relatively expensive. A false-negative result may delay treatment whereas a false positive result may lead to additional and more expensive medical tests, and testing without counselling may result in adverse medical or psychological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>People intending to use a self-test are confronted with considering the pros and cons of self-testing. In previous unpublished observations we found that individuals who intend to perform a cholesterol or diabetes self-test simultaneously perceived benefits as well as barriers towards using a self-test, i.e., they hold positive and negative beliefs towards self-testing at the same time. Feelings of ambivalence can result in an uncomfortable state that people might want to resolve by making a decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To support people in making the choice whether or not to use a self-test, we developed two web-based decision aids (DAs) on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes. DAs are aimed at supporting patients in making a screening or treatment choice that is the best choice considering their specific situation and matches their personal values and preferences. DAs have shown to improve patients&#x02019; knowledge on options for screening and diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, and to reduce decisional conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our DAs provide neutral information on diagnostic self-testing in general and on self-testing for cholesterol or diabetes specifically. The DAs were based on clinical practice guidelines, previous research on self-testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the International Patient Decision Aid Standard (IPDAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the Health Belief Model (HBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The HBM was originally designed to explain relatively simply health behaviours, such as screening, which may be considered similar to self-testing. The HBM states that people will be inclined to engage in a health-related behaviour if they evaluate their susceptibility to and the severity of a particular condition of illness as high, and if they believe that a certain action can reduce this threat. Furthermore, they have to perceive more benefits than barriers regarding that behaviour. The presence of certain cues, for example the offering of free tests, can stimulate action. Additionally, they need to be confident about their ability to successfully perform the behaviour. Background variables such as socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge can influence the central concepts of the HBM and, as a result, health behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The aforementioned HBM concepts were included in our DAs, for instance information on the pros and cons of self-testing (perceived benefits and barriers). However, our DAs were not aimed at changing or influencing self-test behaviour and the concepts were not translated into behaviour change strategies.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the decision aids on the intention to self-test for cholesterol or diabetes as well as factors related to that intention by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We addressed the following research questions: (1) &#x02018;What is the effect on the intention to use a self-test for cholesterol or diabetes?, (2) &#x02018;What is the effect on HBM-concepts of self-testing for cholesterol or diabetes, and (3) &#x02018;Has there been a reduction in ambivalence towards self-testing for cholesterol or diabetes in the intervention conditions compared to the control conditions?&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was reviewed by the Medical Ethical Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre which indicated that formal approval was not deemed necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>A web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in which the online DAs on cholesterol and diabetes were compared to short, non-interactive and non-test-specific information on self-testing.

Randomization of both groups into two groups of equal size was computer-generated with the random number generators function within the SPSS statistical package.

This e-mail contained a link to either the online DAs or the control information and informed participants to open this link, read the information, and after closing the link they were automatically routed to the follow-up questionnaire. After one week, a reminder was sent to panelists who had not filled out the questionnaire. Panelists received an incentive after completing the questionnaires, according to the norms held by Flycatcher. Socio-demographic variables such as age, gender, and level of education of each respondent were provided by Flycatcher.</p><p>A more detailed description of the methods is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Panelists were invited to participate in the RCT if they had an intention to maybe, probably or definitely use a cholesterol and/or diabetes self-test.

This number was based on a Cochrane review on the efficacy of DAs in which an average absolute increase of 15% in knowledge scores was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our sample size would allow a detection of a 15% absolute difference in knowledge with a power of 80% and an alpha of .05 (two-sided).

In September 2011, the baseline questionnaire was sent to a random sample of the Flycatcher panel and was used for selecting consumers with an intention to maybe, probably or definitely use a diagnostic self-test for diabetes or cholesterol. The questionnaire consisted of questions on personal characteristics such as medical history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and intention towards doing a cholesterol or a diabetes self-test. The complete questionnaire is available elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In October 2011, after participants had been assigned to the intervention or control condition and had been exposed to this condition, participants were invited to fill in the follow-up questionnaire. Participants with an intention to do a cholesterol self-test received questions on cholesterol self-testing, participants with an intention to do a diabetes self-test received a similar questionnaire, but addressing the diabetes self-test. The second questionnaire assessed the HBM-concepts and ambivalence. Our measurements of the HBM concepts were derived from validated questionnaires on other health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We used the questionnaires in previous research on self-testing and found that perceived susceptibility, cues to action, perceived benefits, perceived benefits and self-efficacy were significant predictors of self-test use or the intention to use a self-test. They also contributed to the explanation of the variance of self-test use or the variance in the intention to use a self-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

There is an ongoing scientific debate regarding the pros and cons of self-test and the effects of self-testing on, for example, psychological, societal, and medical aspects, are still unclear. By developing DAs on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes, we have tried to provide neutral information on self-testing that supports consumers in making an informed choice that is in line with their personal values. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the DAs on the intention to use a self-test for cholesterol or diabetes, as well as their effects on HBM variables and ambivalence towards self-testing.</p><p>Analyses revealed limited effects of being exposed to the DA on intention, the HBM variables, and ambivalence. Analyses on intention only showed a significant group by intention at baseline interaction effect within the diabetes condition. Participants who had indicated to maybe intend to use a self-test for diabetes at baseline, had a higher intention at follow-up in the control group compared to participants in the intervention group. The intention of these participants in the intervention group did not change between baseline and follow-up, whereas there was a slight increase in the control group. We did not find an effect at follow-up among participants who indicated to probably or definitely intend to use a self-test for diabetes at baseline. This might be a mere measurement effect implying that asking intention questions related to a particular health behaviour could in itself result in changes in level of intention and subsequent behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This measurement effect may have been outweighed by the information provided in the intervention group concerning pros as well as cons related to self-testing and thereby be restricted to the control group. An explanation for only finding this result in the group of <italic>maybe</italic> intenders might be that there is more variance within this group as compared to the group of people who probably or definitely intend to use a self-test. This group of maybe-intenders might include people who never actually thought about using a self-test but who did not want to reject the possibility of ever using a self-test beforehand as well as of people who actually doubt whether or not to use a self-test. These maybe-intenders might be easier to influence by merely asking questions as compared to people who already made up their mind, e.g. people who probably or definitely intend to use a self-test.</p><p>Analyses on the HBM variables revealed a significant effect of group on cues to action within the cholesterol condition. This group-effect on cues to action within the cholesterol condition reflects that the intervention group perceived more cues to action than the control group. One of the main aspects of our DAs was a risk calculator that addressed several risk factors for CVD and diabetes and provided an indication on the users&#x02019; risk for CVD or diabetes based on the answers provided. This might have led to a greater awareness of the risk factors associated with CVD within the intervention group which might have resulted in perceiving more cues to action in the intervention group than the control group.</p><p>We did not find any additional intervention effects on HBM concepts. The goal of our DAs was to provide neutral information on self-testing for cholesterol or diabetes and to support consumers in making an informed choice that is in line with their values regarding whether or not to use a self-test. Our DAs were not aimed at changing or influencing self-test behaviour and, as a result, within our DAs, the HBM concepts were not specifically addressed and translated into behaviour change strategies. Although the time spent on the DAs was limited, it might be suggested that we succeeded in providing neutral information on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes.</p><p>We only found a marginally significant group effect on ambivalence towards using a diabetes self-test suggesting that participants in the intervention group were less ambivalent than participants in the control group. One of the main goals of DAs is to reduce decisional conflict and, consequently reduce ambivalence towards self-test use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our results suggest that we might have not achieved this. However, the majority of our sample consisted of participants who indicated to <italic>maybe</italic> intend to use a self-test for cholesterol or diabetes. According to the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM), these maybe-intenders are people that are deciding about acting, but are undecided yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our sample, the group of maybe-intenders may have included people who never thought about using a self-test before but who still want to have the opportunity to use a self-test in the future, and were therefore not personally engaged by the subject. These persons may report feelings of ambivalence, but because of their disengagement in the issue, they may not have been motivated to solve these feelings of ambivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ambivalence is experienced as being particularly unpleasant when people are confronted with the necessity to make a choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, deciding about using or not using a diagnostic self-test is not a life-threatening decision and does not create an urge to solve these feelings of ambivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, within our study, participants were not forced to make a choice on whether or not to use a self-test, we merely asked if their <italic>intention</italic> to use a self-test changed. This may also have resulted in the lack of an urge to solve these feelings of ambivalence. Therefore, we may not have found any effects of our DAs on ambivalence.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Study limitations and strengths</title><p>The results of the current study have to be interpreted in light of some strengths and limitations. The generalizability of our study findings might be limited because we used a random sample of an existing Internet panel. Compared to the general population in the Netherlands, our respondents were more often female, and more highly educated respondents were over-represented while low education levels were under-represented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In most studies on the effectiveness of DAs, DAs are compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since there is no usual care available in self-testing, we developed our own control materials. These control materials consisted of very limited information about self-testing containing the definition of self-testing and the different types of self-testing. All distinctive features of our DAs, e.g. interactive elements such as risk calculators and value clarification tools as well as test-specific information, were not included in the control materials. By doing this, we aimed to create a fair contrast between the intervention and control conditions. However, although there were significant differences between the intervention and control conditions in the time they spent on the DA respectively on the PDF, actual exposure to the DA might have been too low.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Practical implications and future research</title><p>By developing DAs on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes, we aimed to support consumers in deciding whether or not to use a self-test and to make a decision that is in line with their personal values. To determine whether we succeeded in achieving this aim, data on informed choice needs to be thoroughly analyzed, and will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>By using the Internet as a medium to deliver our DAs, we had the opportunity to potentially reach a large population and to include interactive and tailored elements in our DAs. However, the time spent on the DAs in our study was limited, and research on Internet delivered behaviour change interventions shows that the actual reach of Internet delivered interventions fall short of expectations. Evidence from studies on the efficacy of these Internet delivered interventions suggests that the actual use of and exposure to the intervention content is low and these exposure rates might be even lower when the intervention is implemented in real life. Additionally, the time spent on assessing the contents of Internet delivered interventions is limited which results in insufficient exposure to the intervention content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Real life implementation of our DAs combined with the assessment of time spent on website and registration of which contents of our DAs are visited, need to determine which parts of our DAs actually reach the users.</p><p>The majority of our participants were <italic>maybe</italic>-intenders which might have resulted in a group of people who were not that motivated to use the DAs on self-testing. Since the information provided in our DAs was largely aimed at using the test and interpreting its result, these <italic>maybe</italic>-intenders might not have been interested in these subjects since they have not yet decided whether or not to use a self-test. Future research should assess the effects of our DAs among people who have actually decided to use a self-test and who arrived at the point of actually buying one. By targeting people who probably or definitely intend to use a self-test, it can be assessed whether the contents of our DAs are applicable within this group of intenders and whether the DAs have an effect on actual self-test behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found limited effects of the DAs on intention, HBM factors, and ambivalence. Although the time spent on the DAs was limited, we might assume that our DAs contain neutral information on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes. By implementing our DAs in real life in combination with assessing time spent on website, registering the contents visited in the DA, and assessing its effects among people who probably or definitely intend to use a self-test we may be able to determine whether or not our DAs are effective in supporting consumers in making an informed choice that is in line with their personal values.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>GR and TvdW conceived the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
