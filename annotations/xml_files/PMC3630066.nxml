Clinical benefit from CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO<sub>2</sub> on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO<sub>2</sub> or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Contrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO<sub>2</sub> reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F<sub>1,47</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.438; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F<sub>2.6,121.2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.3; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO<sub>2</sub> could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Carbon dioxide</kwd><kwd>Trigeminal pain</kwd><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>Capsaicin</kwd><kwd>Headache</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>While efficacy of high-flow oxygen has been studied in several placebo-controlled studies on cluster headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and recently in migraine as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], little is known on effects of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) on the craniofacial nociceptive system.</p><p>Phasic nasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> is used to elicit experimental trigeminal pain in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to record negative mucosal potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and chemosensory evoked potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, if given continuously, a significant habituation i.e. a decrease of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced pain can be observed after some minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Likewise, repeated short stimuli of CO<sub>2</sub> with high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (more than 90% v/v) induce a rapid attenuation of negative mucosal potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These results were translated into therapeutic utility by showing a reduction of post-dural puncture headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and chronic cluster headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] upon prolonged inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub>. Preliminary data also show efficacy of nasal CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in migraine patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The putative mode of action is uncertain. As CO<sub>2</sub> is a potent vasodilator, the first studies attributed possible therapeutic effects to the vasodilating properties on cerebral vessels. More recently, CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to be a powerful modulator of activated nociceptive trigeminal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Tzabazis and co-workers sensitized rat cheeks with capsaicin and insufflated CO<sub>2</sub> or air nasally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Nocifensive behaviour defined as facial and hind paw withdrawal to radiant noxious heat was significantly attenuated by higher CO<sub>2</sub> flow rates of 0.8 l/min but not of 0.4 l/min CO<sub>2</sub> or air. Based on additional pharmacological experiments the authors concluded that CO<sub>2</sub> exerts its antinociceptive, respectively antihyperalgesic effects by activation of mucosal primary trigeminal afferents through a decreased mucosal pH within the nasal cavity.</p><p>These findings are well in line with the hypothesis that TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal C and A delta fibres (which are activated by application of capsaicin) may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of primary headaches such as migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] although this concept has been challenged recently as TRPV1 receptor blockade was inefficient in <italic>in vivo</italic> models of migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In summary, there are some clinical but also pre-clinical data that nasal instillation of CO<sub>2</sub> could have some positive effect on acute headache. We therefore aimed to examine the modulatory efficacy of intranasal CO<sub>2</sub> on experimental TRPV1-mediated trigeminal pain elicited by intranasal application of capsaicin in healthy volunteers to answer the following questions:</p><p>1. How painful is prolonged intranasal application of CO<sub>2</sub> on a numerical rating scale at a flow rate of 1 l/min?</p><p>2. Does intranasally applied CO<sub>2</sub> lead to relevant systemic changes of pH and pCO<sub>2</sub> in capillary blood samples?</p><p>3. Does intranasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> modulate pain ratings after intranasal application of capsaicin?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a controlled randomized parallel-group study to investigate the effects of intranasal CO<sub>2</sub> on TRPV1-mediated trigeminal pain in healthy volunteers.

Medical grade compressed air was obtained from the hospital gas reticulation system and delivered at a flow of 1 l/min by a flow meter (Dr&#x000e4;ger, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany).

Application of CO<sub>2</sub> alone resulted in mild pain and a significant but clinically irrelevant change in capillary pCO<sub>2</sub> and pH levels. After nociceptive stimulation of the first trigeminal branch with intranasal capsaicin (as a model of TRPV1-mediated craniofacial pain with central sensitization), alternating application of CO<sub>2</sub> reduced pain ratings only minimally compared to a sham paradigm with air, but this effect was abrogated during continuous insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><sec><title>Intranasal application of capsaicin as a human model of trigeminal nociceptive activation</title><p>Capsaicin (8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-trans-6-nonenamide) increases release of substance P and simultaneously blocks its reuptake exerting its effects by activation of the TRPV1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This leads to an activation of the trigemino-vascular system with enlargement of the internal carotid artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] if applied intracutaneously into the skin innervated by the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve but not when applied to the skin innervated by the mandibular (V3) branch or the forearm. The nasal mucosa is innervated by branches of the ethmoidal (V1) and the maxillary (V2) nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with neurons containing predominantly substance P and - to a much lesser extent - CGRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Noxious stimulation with capsaicin applied to the nostril causes long-lasting discharges of afferent nerve fibres of the ethmoidal nerve in guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In another study also in guinea pigs, expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos after intranasal capsaicin was highest in the trigeminal complex with the subnuclei caudalis and interpolaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the majority of cells which innervate the dura show a co-localisation of TRPV1 receptors and CGRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with slices of rat trigeminal nucleus caudalis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that activation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptive trigeminal afferents causes release of CGRP. CGRP itself does not activate meningeal afferents but is thought to facilitate nociceptive transmission in the spinal trigeminal nucleus via presynaptic modulation of other primary afferents rather than direct effects on second-order neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A relevant role in migraine pathophysiology is supported by the observation that migraine attacks can be aborted by administration of CGRP receptor antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. According to Lambert and colleagues the TRPV1 receptor antagonist SB-705498 does not suppress activation in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in cats following electrical and mechanical stimulation of nociceptive meningeal and facial afferents. However, sensitisation induced by inflammatory soup was significantly attenuated by SB-705498 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, Summ and co-workers challenged a relevant role of TRPV1 receptors in migraine pathophysiology as blockade of TRPV1 receptors did neither modulate experimentally induced cortical spreading depression nor neurogenic dural vasodilation or nociceptive transmission in the trigemino-cervical complex in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of whether TRPV1 receptor positive V1 neurons are indeed involved in migraine pathophysiology or not, they have been associated with other craniofacial pain syndromes such as dental pain where an upregulation of TRPV1 expression in rat trigeminal ganglia was observed in a model of lipopolysaccharide-induced pulpitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We note that we did not strive for a specific model such as migraine headache but a robust model of craniofacial pain including TRPV1 activation affecting the first trigeminal branch. In our sample, participants showed a transient and significant increase in pain ratings after nasal application of capsaicin which is in line with other studies showing a subsequent and temporary regional sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Pain ratings peaked after 8-9 min which is congruent with an animal study on neuronal activity in the rat nucleus caudalis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. After application of capsaicin to the eye and the tongue a delayed activity peaking also after 4-6 min was found. Thus, intranasal application of 200 &#x003bc;g capsaicin is a potent model for stimulation of TRPV1 positive nociceptive neurons of the first trigeminal branch.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics, tolerability and safety of intranasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub></title><p>CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation was rated as mildly painful by 65% of patients. We found systemic changes in capillary pH and pCO<sub>2</sub> levels but no relevant alterations beyond the normative range and conclude that nasal application at 1 l/min is safe. Insufficient delivery of CO<sub>2</sub> into the nasal cavity seems unlikely as changes of pCO<sub>2</sub> levels after nasal insufflation did not correlate with pain ratings in our pilot study.</p><p>Our attempts to mimic CO<sub>2</sub> induced unpleasantness respectively pain with vaporized ammonia to establish a robust sham condition were in vain (data not shown). Ammonia induced a more stabbing and - at higher concentrations - unbearable pain in the nasal cavity with variable pain thresholds. The unpleasantness of <italic>intranasal</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> in our sample implies that true blinding is not feasible at flow rates of 1 l/min and above as most patients will notice an unpleasant or painful perception. As clinical effects were negligible in our sample, potential sources of bias such as a relevant placebo effect are unlikely.</p><p>At lower <italic>intranasal</italic> flow rates of 0.6 l/min, blinding seemed to be less problematic in prior studies. Casale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] reported that 80% of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis did not notice nasal stinging or burning during nasal <italic>insufflation</italic> of CO<sub>2</sub> at 0.6 l/min for only 1 minute &#x02013; similar to the setup used in the therapeutic studies in migraine patients by Spierings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>Inhalation</italic> of CO<sub>2</sub> was less well tolerated raising doubts about effective blinding in prior studies reporting efficacy of inhaled CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulatory effects of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation on nociceptive trigeminal activation</title><p>The antihyperalgesic efficacy of CO<sub>2</sub> in our study was small and reached statistical significance only when CO<sub>2</sub> and placebo were given in an alternating fashion within the same subject (experiment 1) &#x02013; as opposed to application of either CO<sub>2</sub> or air only in experiment 2. It may be easier for the participants to sense a subtle analgesic or anti-hyperalgesic efficacy of CO<sub>2</sub> if it is given in a contrasting fashion with air as placebo.</p><p>As shown by Tzabazis and colleagues in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], nasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> with flow rates of 0.8 l/min attenuated nocifensive behaviour after sensitization with capsaicin unlike lower flow rates of CO<sub>2</sub> (0.4 l/min) or air. In the nasal mucosa CO<sub>2</sub> decomposes into protons and carbonate catalyzed by mucosal carbonic anhydrase and activates TRPV1- and ASIC- positive neurons by proton accumulation. Subsequent, central inhibitory effects are proposed such as a widespread inhibition of afferent trigeminal input though inhibitory interneurons, trans-segmental inhibitory control circuits or conditioned pain modulation.</p><p>Vause and colleagues showed that incubation of cultured trigeminal ganglions with CO<sub>2</sub> or capsaicin resulted in an acidification of culture medium and a consecutive nociceptive activation with CGRP release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, CO<sub>2</sub> attenuated CGRP release by pretreatment with capsaicin if cultured under isohydric conditions which prevents extracellular but allows intracellular acidification.</p><p>Tzabazis and co-workers observed less intense and only short-lived antinociceptive or antihyperalgesic effects of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation on non-sensitized skin as compared to air insufflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These findings strongly argue in favour of activity-dependent effects of CO<sub>2</sub>, so that efficacy could have been better in patients with chronic craniofacial pain. Alternatively, CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation with a potentially different locus of action could represent a more powerful alternative although tolerability seems to limit feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In summary, intranasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> exerts antihyperalgesic effects in animal models but resulted in only minor clinical effects in our human model of trigeminal pain elicited by activation of nociceptive TRPV1 receptors in healthy volunteers. These moderate effects question the clinical utility of intranasal CO<sub>2</sub> in TRPV1-mediated pain at flow rates of 1 l/min.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical efficacy of CO<sub>2</sub></title><p>Marcussen and Wolff successfully treated aura symptoms in migraine patients termed as &#x0201c;vasoconstrictor symptoms&#x0201d; by inhalation of 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in either air or oxygen for 5 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Likewise, Sikh and Agarwal exposed 40 patients with post-dural puncture headache to 5.6% CO<sub>2</sub> mixed with oxygen for 10 min daily which was repeated up to 2 times if the headache was not relieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. After 3 days, 98% of the patients reported relief compared to 58% of the oxygen only control group. Despite these impressive clinical results on primary and secondary headaches, patients inhaled much higher concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> suggesting a potentially different mode of action. In addition, translating these clinical results to our human model is difficult as the role of the TRPV1 receptor in migraine pathophysiology has been challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies yielded contrasting results. Engel reported that inhalation of 10% CO<sub>2</sub> provoked a headache attack or increased headache intensity in 18 of 40 subjects with mainly posttraumatic headache and migraine. CO<sub>2</sub>-induced headache attacks or aggravation were less intense than headaches triggered by histamine and adrenaline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Likewise, Hannerz and Jogestrand reported that ipsilateral pain could be elicited in patients with active episodic cluster headache during inhalation of 6% CO<sub>2</sub> for 6 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>At present, a firm conclusion on the clinical efficacy of CO<sub>2</sub> in primary and secondary headaches is difficult despite promising data from animal experiments. Trials on the efficacy of inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> in various headache syndromes are relatively old and yielded ambiguous results. Evidence for the efficacy of intranasal CO<sub>2</sub> in migraine has been published in preliminary form.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Only mild modulatory effects of intranasal insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> at flow rates of 1 l/min could be seen in a human model of TRPV1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons which is in line with previous studies.
