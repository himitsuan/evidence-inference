Patients were randomised 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to receive abatacept (&#x0223c;10&#x02005;mg/kg according to weight range) or placebo, plus background MTX, for 4&#x02005;months. Randomisation was by central allocation of a unique number in order of qualification for treatment. Clinicians and patients were blinded; drug preparation professionals were unblinded.</p><p>Abatacept or placebo was administered intravenously on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28&#x02005;days up to and including Month 4. During the OLE all patients received abatacept every 28&#x02005;days from Month 5 up to Month 12, plus background MTX. Patients exited early if they missed &#x0003e;2 consecutive doses; received high dose oral corticosteroids for &#x0003e;2&#x02005;weeks; or were insufficiently controlled (at investigator discretion).</p><p>The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in mean change from baseline to Month 4 in wrist synovitis score; changes in wrist and hand osteitis and erosion were secondary endpoints. The study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00420199) was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation, and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review boards or independent ethics committees approved the protocol, and signed, written informed consent was provided by patients.</p><p>During the study, the following amendments to study design occurred. Patients could have moderate or high, instead of high, baseline disease activity, in order to improve the feasibility of the study and reflect the improving standard of RA care, given that MTX failure patients may not reach high disease activity before receiving a biologic. The timeframe during which intra-articular steroid injections were prohibited was reduced from 12 to 3&#x02005;months prior to screening (initial restriction deemed too conservative).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patient population</title><p>Patients (aged &#x02265;18&#x02005;years) had active RA (according to American Rheumatism Association (1987) criteria) &#x02264;5&#x02005;years' duration.

The p value for the comparison, with significance level 0.05, was calculated. As probability plots did not reveal deviations from normality in changes from baseline in wrist synovitis score to Month 4, a post hoc sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was performed using a parametric ANCOVA, allowing for estimation of the adjusted mean difference between treatment groups.

A persistent beneficial effect on osteitis and synovitis was observed in patients who remained on abatacept over 12&#x02005;months, with inhibition of erosion progression also seen. Following addition of abatacept, patients initially randomised to placebo achieved incremental reductions in synovitis and osteitis by Month 12 to levels similar to those seen in patients who had continuously received abatacept. These patients also showed reduced progression in erosion score after initiating abatacept.</p><p>MRI assessment of abatacept-treated patients has previously been reported in the ADJUST trial in MTX-naive patients with very early or undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, and in patients with psoriatic arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The improvements in MRI synovitis, osteitis and erosion progression seen here with abatacept plus MTX over 12&#x02005;months are consistent with findings from those trials, and with pharmacodynamic data that suggest abatacept may have a positive effect on bone metabolism through its regulatory effect on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> The degree of local baseline inflammation, both synovitis and osteitis, predicts erosion progression during early disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25 R26 R27">25&#x02013;27</xref> Consequently, improving osteitis scores may favourably impact the long-term prognosis of erosion progression.

However, caution must be used when making comparisons across these trials owing to general differences, such as study design, patient populations (particularly different stages of RA) and timepoints evaluated, and MRI-related differences, such as differing magnet field strengths, pulse sequence parameters, the use of contrast agents and the anatomical locations assessed (eg, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and wrists vs wrists alone, as in the current study).</p><p>Abatacept treatment improved disease activity over time in this study, consistent with previous abatacept trials,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> although the proportion of patients achieving treatment targets (based on DAS28 and SDAI) was higher in the current study, probably because these patients had less severe disease at baseline. Patients originally randomised to placebo who switched to abatacept at Month 4 experienced improvements in disease activity by Month 12 that approached those observed in patients continuously treated with abatacept. However, the proportions of patients achieving DAS28 LDAS and DAS28 and SDAI remission at Month 12 suggest that although disease activity improves when patients switch to abatacept, many of them do not reach the low states of disease activity seen in patients who are continuously treated with abatacept.</p><p>Control of disease status at Month 4 in the original abatacept group was associated with greater numerical improvements in synovitis and erosion at Month 12. Reductions in osteitis were seen regardless of the level of disease activity at Month 4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> The disconnect between osteitis and clinical efficacy, where osteitis improved in the context of persistent clinical disease, may be due to the regulatory effect of abatacept on bone, discussed above, or the presence of subclinical disease. Consequently, the reported positive effect on osteitis may result in better long-term structural prognosis regardless of initial clinical efficacy outcomes.</p><p>Abatacept was well tolerated by patients, with a high retention rate in both the DB period and OLE.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></p><p>Certain limitations of this study need to be taken into account. Guidance for powering MRI studies remains uncertain, including the number of anatomical sites to be evaluated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and the responsiveness of the scoring system for each pathological feature. This is a direct result of the paucity of published MRI RCTs at the time the study was designed. Therefore, extrapolation of data from previous MRI RCTs to determine the sample size and anatomical sites may have been imprecise and, as such, this study should be considered exploratory. Assessment of synovitis in this study was restricted to the wrist; contrast-enhanced images of the MCP joints were not acquired owing to limitations in MRI examination time. Additionally, osteitis and erosion were not assessed at MCP 1, as per recent modification of RAMRIS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Another limitation is that the MRI images were read and scored by only one reader; it has been demonstrated that averaging scores from additional readers can reduce error.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Had two MRI readers been used, and a greater number of patients included in the study, the findings for the primary and secondary outcomes may have been different. Finally, the limited number of patients included in this study, and the difference in proportions of RF and anti-CCP positive patients between groups, should also be taken into account when interpreting the analyses. While small MRI studies are suitable for exploring mechanisms of action, the limited number of patients leads to difficulties in interpreting the relationship between a small number of MRI assessed sites and systemic assessment of disease activity.</p><p>Even with the wrist-only assessments of synovitis, abatacept plus MTX was associated with reductions in osteitis, minimal deterioration in erosion and a trend toward reduced MRI synovitis versus placebo plus MTX over 4&#x02005;months, demonstrating an early effect of abatacept on inflammation and structural damage. With continued treatment, patients initially randomised to abatacept experienced persistent benefit in synovitis and osteitis, with inhibition of erosion progression; patients initially randomised to placebo achieved incremental reductions in MRI assessed inflammation and slowing of erosion progression after switching to abatacept. In conclusion, data from the ASSET study extend current knowledge on the early effect of intravenous abatacept on synovium and bone and confirm its use as an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option in patients with RA who have previously failed MTX therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-201611-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e999" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Eve Guichard (Medicus International) for her editorial assistance and Coralie Poncet, Keqin Qi (both Bristol-Myers Squibb) and Harry Genant, (UCSF/Synarc) for their expertise and assistance in data analysis and interpretation.
