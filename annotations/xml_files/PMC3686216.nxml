Similarly, replacing traditional games with active input games resulted in a significant increase in MVPA (3.2&#x02005;min/day, 0.9 to 5.5) and a decrease in sedentary time (6.2&#x02005;min/day, 1.4 to 11.4) in the after-school period.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Electronic games are played on various devices including dedicated consoles (eg, Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii) and hand-held players (eg, Nintendo DS, PlayStationPSP) as well as non-dedicated technologies such as computers, tablets and smartphones. International evidence shows that the majority of children in affluent countries now have substantial daily exposure to electronic games. For example in the UK, approximately half of the children spend over an hour per day using computer games alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> In the USA, children's use of video games has tripled in the past 10&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Indeed, estimates of the daily exposure of children to electronic games in countries such as the UK, the USA and Australia range from 38&#x02005;min/day to 90&#x02005;min/day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8">6&#x02013;8</xref></p><p>While it is known that traditional electronic games are little better than watching television, in terms of body movement and energy expenditure,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> whether electronic games actually displace PA (ie, would children run outside and play if electronic games were not available) has not been established. Cross-sectional studies have shown negative, but weak, relationships between time spent playing traditional electronic games and overall PA level, with a similar relationship for obesity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> However, until now, no study has removed electronic game access entirely from the home and examined the effect on activity. More recently, the new generation &#x02018;active&#x02019; electronic games, such as Sony PlayStation EyeToy and Move, dance mats and Microsoft Xbox Kinect, have added to the controversy. Laboratory studies have shown that some of these active games can result in meaningful increases in muscle activity, movement and energy expenditure while others result in less activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Findings from the few available home-based interventions comparing access to traditional electronic games alone with supplemental access to active electronic games have been mixed: with some evidence for improvements in body fatness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> and fitness in overweight children,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> though there was no effect on objectively measured PA for a sample including both overweight and normal weight children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> The long-term efficacy of active games in promoting PA remains questionable,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> but with potential promise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>With no clear evidence either way, the public-health response until now has been to develop recommendations to restrict all children's screen-based leisure (television, computers and all electronic games), typically to a maximum of 2&#x02005;h a day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Compliance with these guidelines has been poor,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> which may be due to the difficulties experienced by parents when trying to implement the guidelines. Options for parents include removing electronic games from the family home or replacing traditional electronic games with active electronic games. Until now, there has been no study evaluating the effect of both these approaches. Therefore, this study sought to explore, through a crossover randomised controlled trial, the effect of either removing electronic games from the children's home environment or replacing traditional sedentary electronic games with active input electronic games on children's PA and sedentary behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study participants</title><p>This study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia in 2007&#x02013;2010, with the trial registered (Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12609000279224)) and the detailed study protocol published.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In summary, 10-year-old to 12-year-old children were recruited through mass media (radio, newspapers), community newsletters and local school notices. This age group was selected as they are able to provide detailed information in diaries and questionnaires,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> have a high use of electronic games<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and are developing activity and sedentary behaviour patterns preadolescence, which may track into adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Recruitment was staggered as well as spread over 3&#x02005;years to account for seasonal variation and external events and targeted to enable participation of equal numbers of males and females and children representative of a spread of socioeconomic status, electronic game experience and motor competence. Children and their parents were provided with a detailed written description of the study purpose, procedure, benefits and risks, and were given the opportunity to ask research staff for clarification prior to signing assent (children) and consent (parents) to participate. Inclusion criteria were being 10&#x02013;12&#x02005;years of age at the start of the study and able to access the electronic games provided in the study on most days of the week. Children were excluded if they had a diagnosed disorder (parent reported) likely to impact their study participation, movement or electronic game use (other than developmental coordination disorder), lived in a shared care arrangement where the child spent a substantial amount of time in different houses and was unable to maintain game condition access, or lived remote to the University campus. Ethical approval was provided by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>There were three levels of electronic game access. &#x02018;No games&#x02019; involved all dedicated electronic game devices being removed from the family home with a contract by each child that electronic games were to be avoided where possible on other devices and locations. &#x02018;Traditional games&#x02019; involved the provision of a Sony PlayStation 2 with a range of non-violent games requiring game pad input. &#x02018;Active games&#x02019; involved the provision of a Sony PlayStation 2 with EyeToy and dance mat input devices and a range of non-violent games. For each condition, children selected six games and were allowed to change games mid intervention. A condition period of 8&#x02005;weeks was chosen for each intervention as it has been found to be sufficient to show physical and psychological changes. A period of eight weeks also allows for children to accommodate to each condition and is not so long to adversely affect recruitment and compliance in the &#x02018;no games&#x02019; condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>A challenge for the design of this study was to select a design which provided a &#x02018;no games&#x02019; condition with high internal and external validity. A traditional parallel arms randomised and controlled trial would have had low external validity as the children volunteering would not have been representative. From our discussions with children, the removal of all electronic games was only acceptable to the majority of children if the same children could get access to a range of new games and equipment. This is why a within-subjects design was chosen. To control for an order effect, children were randomised to a balanced ordering of the three electronic game conditions. This is why a crossover design was chosen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002629F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002629F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram of flow of participants.

The type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. If the type I error is lowered to 0.01 to account for &#x02018;repeated&#x02019; contrasts between conditions, the power is 0.943.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> We allowed for a 10% attrition in data. The study was curtailed earlier than planned as new electronic game technologies (Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox Kinect) became popular in late 2010 in Perth making it unfeasible to recruit children to the older game technology. Data from nine children who participated in the 2007 pilot study using the same activity and condition protocol were included to provide the best estimate of intervention effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment and study procedure</title><p>Following screening, participants were randomly allocated to an order of conditions by selection of an opaque sealed envelope. A balance of orders across the year was achieved by having sets of the six possible order permutations in each year's cohort. After informed consent/assent from the parent and child, a research officer visited the home and instructed the parent and child in baseline assessments. The baseline visit included an explanation of the accelerometer along with a PA recall diary (see outcomes measures for detail). Baseline data were also collected on the child's height, weight, socioeconomic status, motor coordination and electronic game experience. The research officer returned after 10&#x02005;days to collect baseline assessments and set up the electronic game condition. This involved either removal of all electronic games or setting up electronic game equipment and instructing the parent and child in its use. Follow-up phone calls were made the next day and after 6&#x02005;days to ensure that the game equipment was working correctly. Towards the end of the 6th week in each condition, the research officer visited again to set up the PA assessments (accelerometer and diary). After 8&#x02005;weeks in each condition, the research officer returned, collected the completed activity diary and accelerometer and set up the next condition. Assessments were scheduled to avoid school and public holidays where possible. Individualised reports were provided to participants on study completion. The research officers involved with the setting up of each condition were not involved in the subsequent analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>PA and sedentary time by accelerometry</title><p>The primary outcome was the mean daily minutes of MVPA over the whole week. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous, light and sedentary intensity PA was assessed over 7&#x02005;days using Actical accelerometers worn on the hip. Actical is a widely used and validated accelerometer in studies of children and adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29 R30 R31">29&#x02013;31</xref> The accelerometers were set to record at 15&#x02005;s epoch intervals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> As per established standard practices with accelerometry, a minimum of 4&#x02005;days (at least 1&#x02005;weekend day) was regarded as a valid recording.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> The minimum recording time required for a day to be considered valid was 500&#x02005;min.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Data were visually checked individually for missing values. Non-wear time, regarded as 120&#x02005;min of consecutive zeros (based on pilot data showing that children could accumulate more than 60&#x02005;min of consecutive zero counts when watching television), was removed prior to analyses. Activity intensity thresholds based on Colley and Tremblay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> were used to convert the raw counts into minutes of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous intensity PA. Minutes spent in each of these intensity categories were calculated for an average day over the whole week. As there are known to be variations depending on the type of day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> and time of the day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> which may be masked in whole week analysis, analysis was also conducted on school days, weekend days and the after-school period (from 15:30 to 18:00). The after-school period was chosen as this has been suggested to be an important time in the child's day for both discretional PA and sedentary leisure time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> Measures of the pattern of sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous activity were also calculated for the same time periods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> A Custom LabView program was used to process the data.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>PA and sedentary behaviours by diary</title><p>To provide descriptive information on the type of activities performed and understand any changes in accelerometer determined exposure, participants used a modified version of the previous-day physical activity recall (PDPAR) in the form of a diary for 7&#x02005;days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> The predominant activity was recorded for each 30&#x02005;min block during waking hours. Use of the PDPAR over several consecutive days, in the form of a diary, has also been shown to be valid, against measures of accelerometry, and feasible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> The participants also used this diary to make a note of whether and why the accelerometer was removed for any period during the day. Active leisure, sedentary leisure and various components of sedentary leisure were assessed across the whole week, school days, weekend days and during the after-school period using custom macros in Excel.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Covariates</title><p>Age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and electronic game experience were considered for potential modification of condition effects. Prior PA research has identified significant differences between summer and winter seasons and interactions with sex (more reduction in PA in winter in girls).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> The potential seasonal effect was allowed for in the design by having a balanced ordering of game conditions and a staggered start to cover the whole school year. Previous electronic game experience which could confound the effect of the game condition was measured using a questionnaire based on our prior studies and a large USA study and used in analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were analysed using mixed-model repeated measures analyses to estimate the magnitude of two condition contrasts for each outcome (no games vs traditional electronic games, and active electronic games vs traditional electronic games) using measures from participants with valid data from at least two of the three conditions, adjusting for period and, in the case of accelerometry data, accelerometer wear time. Eleven participants were missing valid accelerometry data for one condition (4 traditional, 2 no games and 5 active games), and there were no participants missing data for more than one condition. These missing values were accounted for in the linear mixed model, which uses a likelihood-based estimation procedure resulting in non-biased estimates by imputation of missing responses based on the surrounding responses and modelled covariance structure. Testing for a treatment by period interaction with statistical significance set at p&#x0003c;0.1 was used to determine whether a carryover effect existed. To verify the absence of influential outliers, initial screening was performed by graphical examination of condition differences plotted against averages, and standardised residuals from each model were plotted against fitted values.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/IC V.10.1 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station Texas, USA). All statistical tests were two-tailed with &#x003b1;=0.05.

Removal of all electronic games also resulted in a significant decrease of 4.7&#x02005;min/day (0.0 to 9.5, p=0.05) in sedentary time in the after-school period, which was matched with a small, non-significant decrease in sedentary time over the whole week and a larger, non-significant decrease on weekend days. Replacing traditional games with active input games had similar findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002629TB1">table 1</xref>). This exchange resulted in no significant change in MVPA over the whole week but a 3.2&#x02005;min/day (0.9 to 5.5, p=0.007) increase in MVPA in the after-school period, with a similar though non-significant pattern of MVPA over the whole school day. Replacing electronic games with active input games also resulted in a small, non-significant increase in light activity over the whole week, with a larger though still non-significant increase on weekend days. Furthermore, replacement of traditional games with active input games resulted in a significant decrease in sedentary time in the after-school period of 6.2&#x02005;min/day (1.4 to 11.1, p=0.012).

No significant effects on overall daily or weekly activity or sedentary time were observed.</p><p>This is the first randomised controlled study, in the real-world setting of the home, to assess the two alternatives parents have for reducing the time their children spend on sedentary electronic games: removal or replacement with something more active. The study findings suggest that parents choosing either option may see a small improvement, more activity and less sedentariness, in the after-school period. Our study corroborates previous research that has shown this time to be a &#x02018;critical window&#x02019; for intervening with PA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> and supports more recent qualitative findings that suggest it is also an important time in the day to reduce children's screen viewing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> The magnitude of effect, approximately 5&#x02005;min more activity and 5&#x02005;min less sedentary time, is similar to improvements observed in other home-based studies. Maddison <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> found a self-reported 10-min increase in active games use and a self-reported reduction in sedentary electronic games use when children were provided with active electronic games in addition to traditional electronic games in a 6-month study. While Baranowski <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> observed no objectively measured increase in daily MVPA or decrease in daily sedentary time in their home-based study, day type or specific day periods were not studied.</p><p>On its own, the magnitude of the change observed is unlikely to be of clinical importance; however, it needs to be seen in the context of electronic games being part of the rapidly growing exposure that children have to screen-based leisure. While time spent viewing television appears to be stable,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> leisure time exposure to console-based electronic games and computing is increasing rapidly,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> as is the increase in mobile smartphones and touch screen tablets that are used for electronic gaming, social networking, video viewing and internet surfing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> Therefore, small changes across a variety of these platforms could result in a more substantial clinical impact. While our study focused on the home setting, school offers another opportunity for more active technologies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> Children sit for a long time at school and there is potential to further reduce sedentariness by engaging with technologies such as sit-stand desks or active-input electronic media as part of lessons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></p><p>The strengths of the study include the strong within-subjects randomised controlled trial design with staggered starts and counterbalanced orders to control for extraneous factors. The participants were representative of a general population of 10-year-old to 12-year-old children in terms of sex, weight, motor coordination, electronic game experience and socioeconomic status, informing the likely broad impact of replacement as a public-health intervention. The study was also grounded in the naturalistic setting of the family home. While active-input technologies have been tested by children in the laboratory and found to increase energy expenditure, this does not account for what happens in practice when the active games are among a milieu of other distractions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Furthermore, this is the first study to examine the effects of fully removing electronic games from the home. The study also used active electronic game technology with a known capacity to increase whole body movement and energy expenditure, rather than the Wii which children can play with only hand movements. Some Wii-based games have been found to be little different to traditional sedentary electronic games.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> The study also provided a substantial range and variation in game offerings, addressing the known issue of active games being less engaging,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> although it was difficult at times to keep participants engaged as the most popular game genre&#x02014;killing&#x02014;was excluded from the study on ethical grounds. The other key strength of the study is that it used an objective measure of PA and sedentary time and supplemented this with self-reported diary measures to aid the understanding and interpretation of results.</p><p>The main weakness was the need to curtail the study 1&#x02005;year early due to electronic game technology changes, specifically the widespread introduction during late 2010 of new active electronic game devices Xbox Kinect and PlayStation Move. These new technologies and the active games available on these devices were qualitatively different and could not simply replace the older devices in the same protocol. This meant children were unwilling to agree to the original protocol, and thus recruitment ceased. The inability to recruit participants for the final planned year resulted in a reduced sample size which was partly compensated for by using data from nine subjects who participated in the protocol in 2007. The reduced numbers meant that we were unable to determine whether the 10&#x02013;15&#x02005;min change in sedentary and light intensity activity on weekends was real. The withdrawal of participants and the lack of adequate accelerometry data on some participants are other obvious limitations. A further limitation was that while the diaries suggested compliance to both conditions was good, we did not have a way of measuring precisely how much the active games were used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>The accelerometer data presented here showed small improvements in whole body movement, which may be useful for a range of physiological effects, one of which is energy expenditure. However, the actual energy expenditure, and thus the likely impact on obesity, should also be determined. The small improvements seen at a group level may mask varied changes for individuals, with the potential for the exposure of some individuals to be markedly affected. Thus, the effect modification of factors such as sex, age, electronic game experience, attitudes to technology and PA, motor competence and weight status should also be examined.</p><p>Given the strong evidence for detrimental effects of too little PA and too much sedentary time,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>

Children in this study were sedentary for just over 8&#x02005;h/day and reported spending approximately 3&#x02005;h/day on screen-based leisure, on the low side but comparable with international findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> Given this high sedentary exposure, healthcare practitioners should use all available opportunities to encourage children (and their parents) to be more active and less sedentary. Sigman<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> has recently called for the medical community to take a more proactive approach to reducing children's screen time exposure. In the increasingly electronic media-enmeshed world of youth, it is unrealistic for parents to remove access to screen-based leisure completely, and therefore parents and health professionals alike need to work with technology to assist its development in ways which are health enhancing rather than health reducing. It was encouraging in this study that the replacing option resulted in at least as good an outcome as the removing option, and this may potentially result in more successful long-term outcomes due to better sustained compliance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Screen-based leisure is a major component of sedentary behaviour and interventions should be targeted to television, computer and electronic game use. This study has shown that replacing sedentary electronic games with active electronic games will provide at least as good an activity outcome and perhaps be easier for the parent and child to sustain than removing electronic game technology from the home.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e167" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002629.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e168" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002629.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the children and their families for their dedication.
