It is characterized by progressive thinning of the scalp hairs, defined by various patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which can start at any age after puberty and is potentially reversible. Even if from a medical point of view, AGA is considered a relatively mild condition; however, people suffering from this condition consider AGA a serious condition that impacts their self-esteem, well-being, social relationships, and confidence.</p><p>The main factors underling hair loss in AGA are genetic predisposition and increased sensitivity of the hair follicles to androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. AGA is often precipitated and exacerbated by conditions that can induce telogen effluvium, including drugs, acute stressors, and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in recent years it has been shown that other factors, such as microinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], decreased microcirculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], can cause hair loss in AGA. These changes contribute to shifting the normal balance of the hair cycle leading to a shortening of the anagen phase. The major components of balding in AGA are frontotemporal recession and loss of hair over the vertex. Hairs become shorter and finer, and finally complete hair loss occurs except at the lateral and posterior margins of scalp, where hair is retained.</p><p>Histologically, in AGA large terminal follicles diminish in size during hair cycles, and the resulting miniaturized follicle eventually produces a microscopic hair. Testosterone is necessary for miniaturization, and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, which block the conversion of testosterone to its more active form dihydrotestosterone (DHT), delay the progression of AGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recently, Garza and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported the preservation of stem cell population and a decreased conversion of hair follicle stem cells to progenitor cells in bald scalp biopsies from AGA individuals. This finding is consistent with the current clinical concept that AGA is a nonscarring type of alopecia and suggests potential reversibility of the condition.</p><p>Currently, only two medications, based on finasteride and minoxidil as active pharmacological ingredients, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for AGA treatment. However, they are costly, require lifelong treatment, and may have side effects. Furthermore, people are frequently reluctant/intimidated by the pharmacological approach to treat a disease that is not life threatening. Thus, a topical, nonpharmacological, effective cosmetic treatment could be more acceptable to patients.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of the use of a patented (US 6,479,059 B2 and CH 703 390), topical cosmetic product, Crescina<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HFSC (human follicle stem cell; Labo Cosprophar AG, Basel, Switzerland), claimed to be effective for the treatment of male AGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The active ingredients contained in the product were chosen to obtain three main effects: proliferation of the stem cells of both the bulge and the dermal papilla, keratinization, and stimulation of microcirculation. Stem cell and dermal papilla stem cell proliferation was achieved by hydrolyzed rice protein and corosolic acid, respectively. Keratinization was stimulated by cysteine, lysine, and a glycoprotein (lectin). Microcirculation was stimulated by benzyl nicotinate. The mentioned results were obtained from studies commissioned by the company Labo Cosprophar AG, which has filed a patent (CH 703 390 B1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All the study procedures were carried out according to World Medical Association&#x02019;s (WMA) Helsinki Declaration and its amendments (Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amendments).

The improvement of hair resistance to traction in the active group was observed in 89.5% (at T2) and 100% (at T4) of the subjects participating in the trial; whereas in the placebo group it was seen in 52.6% (at T2) and 78.9% (at T4).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Results of pull testing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="5">Active product</th><th align="left" colspan="5">Placebo product</th></tr><tr><th align="left"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="left">Mean (&#x000b1;SD)</th><th align="left">1st quartile</th><th align="left">Median</th><th align="left">3rd quartile</th><th align="left"><italic>n</italic></th><th align="left">Mean (&#x000b1;SD)</th><th align="left">1st quartile</th><th align="left">Median</th><th align="left">3rd quartile</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">T&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000a0;months</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">9.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">10</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">9.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.8</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">T&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;months</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">6.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.8</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">8.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.1</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left">T&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;months</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">4.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.5</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">7.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9</td><td align="left">6</td><td align="left">8</td><td align="left">9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>SD</italic> standard deviation</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Resistance to traction (pull testing) variation during the treatment. *<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 versus T0, **<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01 active treatment versus placebo, ***<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 versus T0, ****<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 active treatment versus placebo. <italic>T0</italic> baseline, <italic>T2</italic> 2&#x000a0;months, <italic>T4</italic> 4&#x000a0;months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13555_2013_21_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Global Photographic Assessment</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the macroscopic effect of the product on hair growth.

The pharmacologic treatment of AGA is expensive, requires lifelong treatment, and may have side effects. Subjects are also reluctant/intimidated to use drugs for a nonpathologic condition; however, use of cosmetics is more acceptable.</p><p>A large number of cosmetics claiming to be effective in the coadjuvant treatment of AGA are sold on the market, but some lack proof of effect, relying only on the effects of the raw materials. Contrary to this approach, new cosmetic regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] require manufactures to demonstrate product efficacy in order to protect subjects from misleading claims.</p><p>The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of the topical application of cysteine, lysine, a glycoprotein, hydrolyzed rice protein, and corosolic acid (the active ingredients that are contained in the formulation of Crescina<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HFSC) in promoting hair growth and in decreasing hair loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It would be desirable to analyze a larger population sample; however, this would require longer-term studies (approximately 1&#x000a0;year), which are not always compatible with the needs of the economic commitment of research and the cosmetic market, which is rapidly and constantly developing. Moreover, the compliance of large groups of subjects who undergo the test decreases with time spent in the clinical trials. On this basis, as the present study has already shown efficacy in the short term (4&#x000a0;months), it was considered significant and important to highlight this positive result. The authors can further expand these data by considering a greater sample size and longer-term study.</p><p>In conclusion, the present investigation has demonstrated the effects of a mixture of ingredients that is able to promote hair growth and decrease hair loss. The results obtained showed that Crescina<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HFSC applied for 4&#x000a0;months in subjects suffering from alopecia grade II to IV was effective in stimulating hair follicle activity as demonstrated by the time-dependent anagen rate increase. Correspondingly, the treatment decreased hair loss and hair resistance to traction, demonstrating its beneficial effect on hair loss.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the staff of Farcoderm for their professionalism and support during study development.
