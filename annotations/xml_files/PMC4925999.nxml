Almost 50% of such deaths occur due to Myocardial Infarction (MI).<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> According to the report published by World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 14 million people globally die due to MI. However, recent surgical and pharmaceutical interventions have reduced the mortality resulting from MI. Yet, prognosis of patients with acute MI is still poor.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment regimen, especially dietary and medication regimen, is one of the disease-related behaviors which can predict successful treatment and reduce the severity of the disease and its complications.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Adherence to treatment regimen is especially of utmost importance in patients with CVDs.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Patients often have challenge with dietary modifications, especially with heart-healthy dietary pattern, and their adherence to the prescribed regimens not appropriate after discharge.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Moreover, patients with MI are commonly advised to take lots of medications for long periods of time to reduce the complications, morbidity, and mortality.</p><p>Despite health care providers&#x02019; advice, medication and dietary adherence is still poor among the patients with MI that can increase the risk of disease recurrence and rehospitalization. Moreover, 48% of all readmission in patients with MI are due to lack of adherence to dietary and medication regimen.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Accordingly, it is essential for clinicians and caregivers to encourage the patients to adhere to appropriate methods which modify the risk factors of CVDs.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Nurses also play a vital role in increasing the patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment regimen and improvement of their clinical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, they can significantly contribute to providing the patients with information about their disease and its symptoms as well as MI-related subjects such as lifestyle, medications, nutrition, physical activities, and stress management which can definitely help them make better decisions about lifestyle modifications in the post-discharge period.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Therefore, providing patients with training and consultation is highly recommended as an essential part of nursing care.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Nurses&#x02019; optimal selection of the type of nursing education and consultation is of great importance in this regard; it can lead to patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment regimen, delay progression of the disease, and reduction of the disease-related complications.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Nowadays, information and communication technology is widely used to alleviate the limitations of health care systems and for better patient care.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It seems that electronic management of chronic diseases is an effective method which helps to obtain reliable information, empowers the patients, affects their attitudes and behaviors, and potentially improves their medical conditions.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Tele-nursing, which is a part of electronic health (e-Health), has provided the possibility to deliver nursing care and conduct nursing practice through communication devices, such as movies, Internet, and telephone, among which telephone is more available and widely used by the majority of individuals.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is a very helpful and cost-effective method to assess the patients&#x02019; out-of-hour care needs and to reduce the frequency of check-ups.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Using telephone not only reduces the costs and facilitates access to effective healthcare, but it also improves the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. It can eliminate the barriers associated with time and place, as well.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Weekly or monthly telephone conversations of nurses with patients and providing consultations can be considered a promising healthcare approach that can increase the positive outcomes of the treatment and improve management of patients&#x02019; health conditions.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Research has shown that telephone-delivered interventions could improve self-efficacy among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It also could significantly decrease emotional distress and improve functional status and mental impression (quality of life) in patients suffering from breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Besides, telephone-based interventions could result in clinically important reductions in hospital readmissions among adults with asthma.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Several studies in Iran have also reported that such interventions could improve the patients&#x02019; quality of life after pacemaker implantation,<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> reduce readmissions in patients with heart failure,<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> reduce glycosylated hemoglobin, and play an effective role in controlling the glycemic level.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, no comprehensive studies have been performed in Iran on the use of telephone follow-up interventions for providing healthcare to patients with MI.

On the other hand, the exclusion criteria of the study were unwillingness to participate in the study, not answering the telephone for more than three consecutive times, and need for coronary artery bypass surgery.</p><p>After providing the patients with information regarding the study objectives and procedure, their written informed consents were obtained and their anonymity and confidentiality were guaranteed. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, Morisky&#x02019;s 8-item Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ), and dietary adherence questionnaire before and three months after the intervention. Demographic data included age, gender, blood pressure, weight, height, marital status, education level, occupation, smoking status, and history of underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Dietary adherence was assessed using dietary adherence questionnaire for patients with MI that is a part of dietary adherence questionnaire for patients with cardiovascular diseases. This self-report questionnaire was developed to assess the patients&#x02019; dietary and medication adherence. This questionnaire consisted of 13 items. The total score of the questionnaire could range from 0 to 46, with higher scores reflecting better adherence to the regimen. In addition, scores 0 -15.3, 15.3-30.6, and 30.6- 46 represented poor, intermediate, and high adherence levels, respectively. Ziaee et al.

Additionally, the participants of the intervention group received a three-month nursing telephone consultation and follow-up. In this study, nurse-led telephone follow-up included phone calls for 12 weeks with patients and providing opportunities for counseling and education about diet, medications and clinical manifestations of myocardial infarction and helping the patients to identify the benefits and barriers of behavioral modifications and encouraging them for observance of treatment regimen.</p><p>The researcher&#x02019;s cell phone number and a call schedule were given to the patients. The schedule included two contacts per week during the first four weeks, one contact per week during the second four weeks, and one contact every two weeks during the third four weeks. The average duration of each call was at least 15 minutes and the researcher was available for contact 24 hours a day in case of any questions or problems.</p><p>The content of telephone conversations generally included the researcher&#x02019;s self-introduction, inquiring about the patient&#x02019;s general health condition, giving healthcare advice, informing the patients about nutrition and medication, assessing the patients&#x02019; level of adherence to dietary and medication regimen, evaluating the behavioral objectives agreed upon by the patients and the researcher, reinforcing health behaviors, terminating the call with the words of encouragement, and arranging the next contact. During the telephone conversation, the researcher emphasized compliance with the plans and agreements made during the training session, evaluated the existing barriers, and proposed possible solutions to the patient&#x02019;s problems. The researcher also tried to involve the patients&#x02019; family members in the process of follow-ups during the telephone contacts.

The points of special interest in the results were the changes occurred in the adherence to dietary regimen in the intervention group; their adherence level increased from poor in the pre-test to high in the post-test after receiving the intervention. However, no significant difference was observed between the dietary adherence level in the pre- and post-test phases in the control group.</p><p>Likewise, tele-nursing intervention could positively affect the patients&#x02019; adherence to medication regimen. The medication adherence level increased from poor in the pre-test to high in the post-test in the intervention group after receiving tele-nursing intervention. However, no significant difference was found between the medication adherence level in the pre- and post-test phases in the control group.</p><p>Our findings were supported and confirmed by the results of other studies. One of them reported that tele-nursing follow-up could improve dietary adherence in patients with MI.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In another study, a twelve-week telephone follow-up intervention resulted in positive changes in post-MI lifestyle.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> A similar study revealed that nurse-led telephone follow-up could improve diabetes diet adherence and decrease glycosylated hemoglobin levels among the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Likewise, the results of a study on the patients with psychological disorders revealed that telephone consultation could improve medication adherence and reduce the referral rate to emergency department.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The results of another study that compared the effects of educational intervention based on adult learning theory with and without tele-nursing on self-management in adult with epilepsy showed that patients who received telephone follow-up in addition to education had a better self-management.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>The effect of nursing follow-up counseling by telephone on blood pressure and self-care behaviors of patients with hypertension was investigated in a clinical trial. The results showed that the intervention had consistently positive effect on the patients&#x02019; systolic blood pressure control, but it couldn&#x02019;t improve the patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment and life style modification. Researchers emphasized the necessity of long term and regular follow-up for enhancing the patients&#x02019; self-care behaviors in chronic conditions.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>During hospitalization, patients with MI usually do not receive effective trainings on the dietary and medication regimen due to their short-term accessibility. Therefore, they might have inadequate knowledge about the regimen and suffer from lack of self-control and self-confidence in the post-discharge period.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Moreover, disconnection from healthcare centers may increase the risk of poor adherence to medication regimen which, in its own turn, may worsen the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, it is important to provide the patients with training and consultation after discharge.<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>Hence, telephone-delivered follow-ups and consultation can be applied as a useful method for self-assessment, monitoring, making decisions, and providing patients with the necessary advice.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> On the other hand, it enables the patients to have a better contact with their healthcare providers at times of need.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Overall, tele-nursing intervention could improve the patients&#x02019; adherence to medical regimen and reduce the symptoms of their disease.</p><p>Telephone follow-up and consultation create an opportunity to provide need-based trainings for the patients, which is not possible through other training methods such as text messaging. The results of one study showed the effect of sending information to patients with hypertension through short text messages on their BP and compliance with therapy. They observed no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in terms of the mentioned variables after six months.<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Such results could be due to failure in providing face-to-face training, the fixed content of training subjects sent by short message system for all patients, and the fact that such educational messages were not tailored to the patients&#x02019; training needs. Hence, short text messages cannot replace a verbal communication since in telephone-delivered consultation healthcare providers talk with patients and answer their questions, but the text messages which are sent to all patients have a fixed content.</p><p>Tele-nursing refers to the use of information technology in providing care to patients. It is designed based on the care needs of the patients when a large physical distance exists between the patient and the healthcare provider.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Such method is commonly applied for the patients with chronic diseases or those who live in rural areas with transportation difficulties.</p><p>Moreover, constant encouragement and advice given by the nurses to patients and their family members can increase the patients&#x02019; independence and self-care skills. Also, establishing a care-based network after discharge can not only solve the patients&#x02019; caring problems, but it can also decrease the rate of their referral to medical centers.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Considering the nurses&#x02019; limited time and the tension of the patients admitted to cardiac intensive care units, it may be difficult to provide face-to-face training well. Therefore, applying tele-nursing, which is time- and cost-effective, is highly recommended.</p><p>The limitations of the current study were its small sample size and short follow-up period. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are recommended to obtain more evidence on the positive effects of tele-nursing on the patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>As to the prevalence of MI, effects of this disease on individuals&#x02019; lives, and importance of adherence to treatment to control and prevent the disease and reduce its symptoms, nurses should find better methods to improve the patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment. It can be concluded from the present study findings that tele-nursing could improve and modify adherence to medication and dietary regimen among the patients with MI.
