Using 2:1 randomisation, 318 patients were allocated the 60 Gy course and 156 the 45 Gy course. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not given. The results show that a 60 Gy course produces a modest lengthening of progression-free and overall survival. They suggest a statistically significant prolongation of median survival from 9 months in the 45 Gy group to 12 months in the 60 Gy group (hazard ratio = 0.75, chi 2 = 7.36, d.f. = 1, P = 0.007). Over 80% of patients reported no morbidity from the radiotherapy, and there was no evidence of increased short-term morbidity in the higher dose group. Late morbidity was not assessed. A prognostic index defined in a previous MRC study was validated in this new cohort. It identifies a group of patients (20% of the total) with a 2 year survival rate of 28% (95% confidence interval 19% to 38%). It was apparent that the survival advantage to the higher dose was maintained even in the poorest prognostic groups defined by this index.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00074-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="769" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00074-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="770" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00074-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="771" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00074-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="772" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00074-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="773" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00074-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="774" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
