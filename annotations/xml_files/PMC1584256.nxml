<bold>Background:</bold> As part of a set of studies known as the Women's Health Initiative trials, investigators aimed to find out whether providing postmenopausal hormone therapy (estrogen in the case of women who had had a hysterectomy, and estrogen plus progestin for women who had not had a hysterectomy) reduced cardiovascular risk as compared to placebo. Earlier observational studies had suggested this might be the case. The trials found that postmenopausal hormone therapy did not reduce cardiovascular risk in the groups studied. However, there was a concern that medication use outside the trial with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and specifically the type of NSAID known as COX-2 inhibitors, could have affected the findings. This concern arose because it is known that COX-2 inhibition lowers levels of prostacyclin, a molecule thought to be beneficial to cardiovascular health, whereas estrogen increases prostacyclin levels. Evidence from randomized trials and observational studies has also shown that patients treated with some COX-2 inhibitors are at increased risk of heart attacks and strokes; the cardiovascular safety of other NSAIDs is also the focus of great attention. Therefore, the authors of this paper aimed to do a statistical exploration of the data from the Women's Health Initiative hormone trials, to find out whether NSAID use by participants in the trials could have affected the trials' main findings.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> In this reanalysis of the original data from the trials, the investigators found that the effects of hormone therapy on cardiovascular outcomes were similar among users and non-users of NSAIDs, confirming that use of these drugs did not significantly affect the results from the Women's Health Initiative hormone trials.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The original hormone trials were large, appropriately randomized studies that enrolled a diverse cohort of participants. Therefore, a large number of cardiovascular events occurred in the groups being compared, allowing this subsequent analysis to be done. One limitation is that use of COX-2 inhibitors in the trial was low; therefore, the investigators were not able to specifically test whether COX-2 inhibitor use (as opposed to NSAID use generally) might have affected their findings.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> The investigators did not set out specifically to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of particular medications in this study. Rather, they wanted to see if these NSAIDs could have modified the effects of the hormone therapy. The secondary analysis done here shows that the main findings from the Women's Health Initiative hormone trials were not significantly affected by use of NSAIDs outside the trial.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hsia J, Manson JE, Kuller L, Pettinger M, Choe JH, et al.

The putative increase in CHD risk with selective COX-2 inhibitors has been attributed to reduction in atheroprotective prostacyclin I<sub>2</sub> levels [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Estrogen activates COX-2 in female mice through an estrogen-receptor-mediated mechanism, thereby increasing levels of prostacyclin [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This observation has raised concern that COX inhibition might counteract a beneficial effect of estrogen on prostacyclin levels and, in fact, account for the absence of cardioprotection with estrogen in recent randomized trials [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Mammals have two isoforms of COX. COX-1 is expressed in most tissues and mediates activities such as vascular homeostasis and gastroprotection [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. COX-2 is induced at sites of inflammation and mediates inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], making its blockade a target for treatment of arthritis and postoperative pain. Low-dose aspirin inhibits COX-1 [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX &#x02212;1 and COX-2 [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and selective COX-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib, celecoxib, and valdecoxib selectively inhibit COX-2 [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The Women's Health Initiative hormone trials unexpectedly demonstrated no overall reduction in coronary risk [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and a suggestion of harm with combination estrogen with progestin [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Limitations include the fact that use of aspirin &#x0003c;80 mg daily was not recorded, that only about 20% of women were using NSAIDs, and that only a few percent used selective COX-2 inhibitors.

COXs synthesize prostacyclin I<sub>2</sub> and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> from arachadonic acid. Prostacyclin I<sub>2</sub>, predominantly a product of COX-2, is a vasodilator that inhibits platelet aggregation and smooth muscle proliferation, effects that might be expected to reduce acute coronary syndromes and stroke. Thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, produced by COX-1 in platelets, is a vasoconstrictor that stimulates platelet aggregation, an effect that might be expected to increase cardiovascular risk. Selective COX-2 inhibitors reduce prostacyclin without inhibiting production of platelet-COX-1-derived thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, a pharmacologic effect that has been hypothesized to underlie the putative adverse cardiovascular effects of these agents [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, NSAIDs reduce formation of both prostacyclin and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, with individual drugs differing in their relative blockade of COX-1 and COX-2 activities. Naproxen and aspirin predominantly inhibit COX-1, whereas diclofenac, etodolac, and meloxicam predominantly inhibit COX-2 [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Participants in the Women's Health Initiative hormone trials consumed a variety of NSAIDs, encompassing a range of ratios of COX-1:COX-2 inhibition.</p><p>Estrogen increases expression of COX-2 and production of prostacyclin I<sub>2,</sub> effects that have been proposed to underlie its apparent cardioprotective effects in animal models [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Female low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor knockout mice developed more aortic plaque if they also lacked the prostacyclin receptor; this phenomenon was not observed in male mice. The prostacyclin-receptor-deficient female mice also demonstrated increased oxidative stress and platelet activation [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In cultured mouse aortic smooth muscle cells, estrogen exposure increased COX-2 expression and prostacyclin formation [<xref rid="pctr-0010026-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In view of these new findings and of the public health impact of the Women's Health Initiative hormone trials, we felt it was important to assess any possible impact of COX inhibitor use on the hormone trial results. Although this analysis cannot conclusively determine whether exogenous estrogen could ever modulate CHD risk with COX inhibition, it does confirm that use of COX inhibitors did not significantly affect the Women's Health Initiative hormone trial results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010026-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010026.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(1.6 MB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010026-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010026.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(147 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The following persons are investigators in the Women's Health Initiative.</p><p>In the program office at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States: Barbara Alving, Jacques Rossouw, Shari Ludlam, Linda Pottern, Joan McGowan, Leslie Ford, and Nancy Geller.</p><p>In the clinical coordinating center at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States: Ross Prentice, Garnet Anderson, Andrea LaCroix, Charles L.
