<bold>Background:</bold> In Papua New Guinea (PNG), malaria is an important cause of death and disease in both adults and children. But concerns exist about whether current antimalarial drugs will be viable for much longer, indicating that new treatments are urgently needed. In 2001, new recommendations on the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria were introduced in PNG. These recommendations specify treating older children and adults with the combination of chloroquine together with sulfadoxine&#x02013;pyrimethamine (SP). However, there is already evidence that malaria parasites in PNG are evolving resistance to this combination therapy. Therefore a group of researchers examined whether new combinations of existing drugs for other diseases could be applied to treatment of malaria in the region. They conducted a trial comparing three different therapies in adults and children over the age of six months who presented to primary care clinics with uncomplicated malaria. The therapies compared were mefloquine (Lariam), quinine taken together with SP, and Cotrifazid, a combination of three different drugs mainly used against tuberculosis. Participants in the trial were followed up for 14 days after treatment, and the main outcome the researchers looked at was treatment failure (i.e., symptoms of clinical malaria together with the presence of malaria parasites in the blood). The researchers also compared the rate of adverse events and presence of malaria parasites in the blood in the different treatment groups.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> Clinical treatment failure at day 14 was very low (either 0% or close to 0%) and approximately equivalent in all three treatment groups. The researchers then compared presence of malaria parasites in the blood and found that a much higher proportion of patients treated with Cotrifazid than the other two treatments had parasites in the blood at day 14 (and the difference was statistically significant). Overall the rate of adverse events was lower in the Cotrifazid group than in the other two treatment groups.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Studies like this one that examine novel antimalarial treatments are particularly timely, as there is an urgent need to find drugs that will treat malaria resistant to current therapies. In this trial the procedures for randomizing participants to the different treatments were appropriate. However, a key limitation is that patients were followed up for only 14 days, and longer follow-up (as many groups now recommend) might have allowed the researchers to more accurately detect differences in efficacy between the treatments being compared.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Few properly randomized controlled trials have been conducted that look at the ability of Cotrifazid to treat malaria. The results of the trial presented here suggest that Cotrifazid is safe, and short-term clinical efficacy is approximately equivalent to mefloquine or quinine plus SP. However, since in this trial Cotrifazid-treated patients were more likely to have malaria parasites reappear in the blood, Cotrifazid does not seem to be a good alternative treatment in PNG.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Genton B, Mueller I, Betuela I, Casey G, Ginny M, et al.

The increasing prevalence of strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> resistant to 4-aminoquinolines and antifolate drugs has created a crisis in the clinical treatment of malaria in many countries, including Papua New Guinea (PNG) [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Introduced in 2001, the new first-line treatment, amodiaquine + sulfadoxine&#x02013;pyrimethamine (SP) for children weighing less than 20 kilograms or chloroquine + SP for others, is associated with up to 25% failure only two years after its introduction (Marfurt et al., unpublished data). The need is therefore urgent to find and test alternative drugs.</p><p>Compounds already on the market for specific indications can easily be screened for effects against neglected diseases. Based on promising preliminary data, a fixed combination including cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, and isoniazid (Cotrifazid) has been developed. It has the advantage of proven safety and tolerability at higher dosage and for longer duration (in tuberculosis).</p><p>The rationale to use this combination is based on animal and human experiments. Rifampicin is active against <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> malaria in rodents (Brun et al., unpublished data) [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In humans, rifampicin showed partial efficacy against <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> when associated with primaquine [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown cotrimoxazole to be active against malaria in humans [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is a pharmacokinetic synergism between cotrimoxazole and rifampicin, with increased half-life and AUC (area under the curve) when administered simultaneously [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Isoniazid has no clear antiplasmodial activity but delays malaria mortality in mice and reduces overall parasite load when given in combination with rifampicin and cotrimoxazole (Brun et al., unpublished data).</p><p>Three studies on Cotrifazid have been conducted in humans in endemic areas, including infants under 6 months of age [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These studies showed Cotrifazid to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of falciparum malaria, whether uncomplicated, complicated, or drug-resistant [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, a formal evaluation was deemed necessary, because the scale of previous studies was small and their methodology was flawed. Additionally, the present study sought efficacy data in geographical areas other than Africa.</p><p>The objective of this trial was to compare, in patients with chloroquine- or amodiaquine-resistant malaria, the efficacy and safety of Cotrifazid to that of mefloquine or quinine + SP. The MRAC (Medical Research Advisory Committee) of Papua New Guinea asked that the mefloquine arm be included, to obtain in Papua New Guinean patients reliable safety and efficacy data on alternative drugs that had shown good potential elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>All patients older than 6 months of age presenting at the centres (described below) who were diagnosed with malaria (history of fever, OptiMAL test-positive, no other major symptoms), and who had already been treated for malaria in the 28 days before, qualified for inclusion in the study if the individual or legal guardian (for children) gave informed consent and if the clinician in charge would have given the standard treatment for drug-resistant malaria independent of the study. A participant was excluded if the clinician preferred to use quinine + SP for any reason (in case of &#x0201c;moderately severe&#x0201d; malaria), or if the patient had one of the symptoms or signs of complicated or severe malaria (i.e., history of recent convulsion, any neurological sign or impairment of consciousness, heavy vomiting, haemoglobinuria, respiratory distress, bleeding, circulatory collapse, shock, jaundice, or haemoglobin [Hb] &#x0003c;5 g/dl), had contraindications for mefloquine (history of psychiatric disorder or epilepsy), or was pregnant.</p><p>All patients suspected on clinical grounds to have drug-resistant malaria were investigated by a nurse employed specifically for the trial who performed the OptiMAL test (Diamed, Cressier, Switzerland).

The Maprik and Wosera areas are situated in the East Sepik Province and the Madang area is in the Madang Province, PNG.

The treatment dosage and schedule for patients was as follows. Patients weighing 40 kg or more: two tablets twice per day; patients under 40 kg and 20 kg or more: one tablets twice per day; patients under 20 kg: one-half tablet twice day. These doses were given every 12 hours for 7 days (days 0&#x02013;6).</p><p>The treatment regimen for mefloquine (Lariam tablet containing mefloquine 250 mg [F.

The lower detection of microscopy when compared to OptiMAL is most likely due to the detection of circulating gametocytes by the rapid test, a phenomenon that was not documented when the study was designed and conducted.</p><fig id="pctr-0010038-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Participant Flow</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0010038.g001"/></fig><p>In the efficacy analysis population for the outcome measures (clinical and parasitological failures on day 14), 32 patients were lost to follow-up on day 14, which left 218 patients (72 Cotrifazid, 71 mefloquine, and 75 quinine + SP) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0010038-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The study was conducted from April 2000 to January 2003.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Baseline Data</title><p>The female:male ratio was 180:184 (five were unknown).

The types of AEs recorded in these last two groups were consistent with those of the literature, which also validates the data recorded for Cotrifazid. Except for &#x0201c;shortness of breath,&#x0201d; none of the prompted AEs was more frequent in the Cotrifazid group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010038-t002">Table 2</xref>). The precise relatedness of the AEs to the drugs used is not reported, since most AEs observed are also those that are encountered during a malaria episode. The known clinical and laboratory AEs of the components included in the Cotrifazid combination were not observed, except for the red-coloured urine&#x02014;an AE that is not medically deleterious.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Efficacy.</title><p>Although the final sample size for efficacy analysis was smaller than expected because the OptiMAL test used for screening was positive in the presence of gametocytes only, we were able to demonstrate equivalence of the three regimens in curing uncomplicated malaria (primary outcome). Indeed, all treatment groups had almost 0% clinical failure, a rate that was lower than the 5% expected in the sample size calculation. The short duration of our follow-up is likely to have impacted positively on treatment outcome, although it is not different from the one used in several recent trials. A follow-up of 28&#x02013;42 d, as proposed by White [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for long-acting drugs, would certainly have allowed us to detect additional clinical failures, especially in the Cotrifazid group in which 9% of the patients infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> at baseline had recurrent parasites by microscopy on day 14. At the time of study design (1999), we decided on a 14-day follow-up since it was, and is still now, the standard duration chosen to determine policy change in areas of intense transmission [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the short follow-up, we are still able to compare our results with recent trials testing other new drugs or regimens in Africa that also used 14 days for assessing treatment outcome [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The situation is less promising when considering parasitological failures. Of the patients treated with Cotrifazid, 15% were parasitaemic (any <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species) on day 14 versus 4% for quinine + SP and 0% for mefloquine. These results reflect slower and less effective parasite clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0010038-g003">Figure 3</xref>) after Cotrifazid treatment, especially for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content>. Most of the reappearing <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> parasites (87%) were true recrudescence, as expected with a follow-up of 14 days, as well as from results of previous studies done in PNG [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and recent data from in vivo studies conducted in the same area, where we found that only 6% (4/72) of the reappearing parasites on day 14 were due to new infections (Marfurt et al., unpublished data). The situation is less clear for <italic>P. vivax,</italic> but a recurrence is more likely than a new infection or relapse in a time period of 14 days. Circulating asexual stages of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> after blood schizonticidal therapy might originate from asexual parasites that survived therapy, from activated hypnozoites that led to a relapse, or from a new infection. Unlike with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> infections, in which true recrudescence can be distinguished from new infections by the use of genotyping methods, current molecular methods used for the genetic analysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> do not allow the unambiguous classification of recurrent parasitaemia, and hence of true treatment failure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The observation of no clinical treatment failure for Cotrifazid but a significant rate of parasitological failure is a matter of great concern. In endemic areas, parasitological failure is usually the first sign of reduced activity of the drug used; adequate clinical responses are still seen, despite persistent parasitaemia, because host immunity helps to alleviate symptoms [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The early parasitological failure rate, the low efficacy to suppress <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> gametocytogenesis, and the rather long regimen are the main reasons to conclude that Cotrifazid is not an appropriate combination therapy, especially in areas where both <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> infections coexist.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Three studies were conducted with Cotrifazid in the past, all of rather small scale and one with serious methodological flaws (the randomisation was stopped at an early stage due to the refusal of patients to be given the standard treatment because of the perceived lower rate of adverse events and excellent efficacy of Cotrifazid) [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The present clinical trial allowed Cotrifazid to be assessed in a large sample size of patients, in an area where different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species coexist, and with effective drug regimens used as comparators. Our results agree with previous ones, namely good safety profile and excellent efficacy to alleviate symptoms. However, Cotrifazid in our study was slightly less effective in clearing <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> parasites than in the African studies (8% failure versus 5% respectively) [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although small, this difference might be due to the fact that parasites from PNG have responded to different and more intense selective pressures than those in Africa, and resemble more the Southeast Asian parasites with a multidrug resistance profile. This might be especially so because we recruited only patients with 4-aminoquinoline-resistant malaria; in the African study, this group had 33% (2/6) parasitological failure. The conclusion of the African study, &#x0201c;Cotrifazid is very well suited for the treatment of malaria tropica, also in cases of apparent drug resistance of P. falciparum against other antimalarials, and even in severe cases of the disease&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], does not, in our opinion, accurately reflect their results, and is therefore overoptimistic, especially in view of the tendency to only consider a treatment acceptable if the overall failure is less than 10%.</p><p>We believe that the design and power of our trial was optimized to accurately assess Cotrifazid safety and efficacy, and the results therefore should robustly support any conclusions on the usefulness of Cotrifazid as an antimalarial drug. Despite its very good safety profile, short-term clinical equivalence with effective drugs such as mefloquine, and low cost, Cotrifazid for malaria does not appear to be an ideal alternative therapeutic option in its current formulation and regimen: patients experience a slower parasite clearance, some recurrence of asexual forms, and higher gametocytaemia on day 14 than after mefloquine or quinine + SP treatment. However, in formulating new and affordable combinations of antimalarial drugs in the future, the clinical efficacy of the Cotrifazid components could be taken into account, especially if it is considered an advantage, as part of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy [<xref rid="pctr-0010038-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], to use drugs that may act on both malaria and pneumonia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010038-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010038.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(45 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010038-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010038.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(133 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the study participants and their families, and the staff of the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research: Manasseh Baea (Officer in Charge) and the nurses, microscopists, field workers, data entry clerks, and drivers.
