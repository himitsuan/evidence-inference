It will be used as an immuno-stimulant in human. It mainly contains Guduchi (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic>) and Ashwagandha (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic>). Guduchi is widely used in ayurvedic medicine for its general tonic, anti-leprotic,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] anti-pyretic,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] anti-allergic,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] anti-inflammatory,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and anti-diabetic properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] It has been reported to benefit the immune system in a variety of ways.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The experimental works on the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of Guduchi have shown significant immuno-modulatory activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Guduchi activates macrophages, which results in increased GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), which leads to leukocytosis and improved neutrophil function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Immuforte is also fortified with sufficient quantity of Ashwagandha (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic>), a well-known therapeutic agent of the ayurvedic medicine. Ashwagandha has been used and proved for its effect as immunomodulator, anti-stress,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] antioxidant activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] The Ashwagandha has been reported to exhibit its immuno-modulatory activity by mobilization and activation of peritoneal macrophages, phagocytosis, and increased activity of the lysosomal enzymes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>Apart from its main ingredients Guduchi and Ashwagandha, it also contains oxides of minerals like zinc and gold in the form of Jasada Bhasma (Zn) and Suvarna Bhasma (Gold). The ayurvedic system of medicine has mentioned the therapeutic potential of these metallic bhasma, and they are regularly utilized and consumed by large number of Indian population for the therapeutic ailment without any observed side-effects. Jasada Bhasma (incinerated zinc) increases strength and intellect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Suvarna Bhasma (incinerated gold) acts as immunomodulator, aphrodisiac and cardiac stimulant. It increases physical strength, complexion, intellect, and memory. It alleviates disorders caused by all the three vitiated <italic>Doshas</italic> and is used in the management of poisoning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Immuforte also contains Shuddha <italic>Hingula</italic>, which is an ore of mercury. The presence of the heavy metals in the ayurvedic preparations is always a point of concerns for its safety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Therefore, use of these products has been banned in the European countries. The ancient traditional methods for detoxification of the metals as mentioned in the ayurvedic texts has been carried out during the manufacture of Immuforte tablets, which includes multiple heating/cooling cycles along with addition of specific herbs. The present study was undertaken to assess proper detoxification of metals constituents of Immuforte and to determine target organ safety, establish relationship between dose or exposure and response and also to identify potential parameters for monitoring adverse effects in clinical studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Immuforte tablets of Batch number:-E-19 (Code No. IMFT-092) were obtained from Shree Dhootapapeshwar Limited, Arogya Mandir, Tilak Road, Panvel &#x02013; 410 206.

The animals did not exhibit any treatment-related abnormal behavioral signs and symptoms. The observations indicated that long-term administration of the Immuforte had no adverse effects on the general health of the animals.</p><p>Amongst the clinical pathology observations, the hematology data is a direct reflection of the possible tissue injury caused by the test compound. For instance, increase in red blood cells reflects overproduction of these elements in response to tissue injury etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Blood biochemistry parameters constitute yet another sensitive parameter of toxicity evaluation. For instance, changes in blood enzymes may be due to cellular/tissue injury leading to their systemic leakage from intracellular sites or target tissues. Similarly, manifestations of altered electrolyte levels are corollary to toxicity-associated conditions like renal dysfunction, dehydration, anorexia, cardiac toxicity, altered vascular permeability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] In the present investigation, although some hematological and biochemical values were significantly different from that of control, all these values were well within the normal range of historical control data of the colony. Secondly, no dose-dependent changes were observed in these parameters, and also recovery group was well comparable to control group, thus the observed difference was due to biological variation and not due to test substance.</p><p>Absolute terminal organ weight and percent relative organ weight indicative of test compound caused changes in functioning of target organs, changes in phospholipids metabolism, over- or under- secretion of enzymes and hormones, hyper/hypoplasia, and possible tissue necrosis. There were no significant difference in absolute organ weights of treated group and recovery group as compared to control group. Although there was difference in some organ weights viz., liver and adrenals, these changes were not dose-dependent, so these could be considered as biological variation. Similarly, the gross and histopathology of various target organs like heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine, and stomach, post-necropsy, revealed that the natural architecture of the various organs remained unaffected. Based on the findings of the study, 600 mg/kg was considered as NOAEL for &#x02018;Immuforte.&#x02019; Blood samples analyzed on atomic absorbance spectrometer (AAS) for heavy metals viz., lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) did not show any detectable levels in blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>It can be concluded that repeated administration of Immuforte for the period of 90 days did not showed any treatment-related adverse effect at the doses used in the study.
