This randomized, controlled, observer-blind phase I study and extension study in Belgium (March 2012&#x02013;June 2015) assessed safety and immunogenicity of investigational acellular pertussis vaccines containing genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (PT) (NCT01529645; NCT02382913).</p><p>420 healthy adults (average age: 26.8 &#x000b1; 5.5&#x000a0;years, 60% female) were randomized to 1 of 10 vaccine groups: 3 investigational aP vaccines (containing pertussis antigens PT, filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN] at different dosages), 6 investigational TdaP (additionally containing tetanus toxoid [TT] and diphtheria toxoid [DT]), and 1 TdaP comparator containing chemically inactivated PT. Antibody responses were evaluated on days 1, 8, 30, 180, 365, and approximately 3&#x000a0;years post-booster vaccination. Cell-mediated immune responses and PT neutralization were evaluated in a subset of participants in pre-selected groups. Local and systemic adverse events (AEs), and unsolicited AEs were collected through day 7 and 30, respectively; serious AEs and AEs leading to study withdrawal were collected through day 365 post-vaccination.</p><p>Antibody responses against pertussis antigens peaked at day 30 post-vaccination and then declined but remained above baseline level at approximately 3&#x000a0;years post-vaccination. Responses to FHA and PRN were correlated to antigen dose. Antibody responses specific to PT, toxin neutralization activity and persistence induced by investigational formulations were similar or significantly higher than the licensed vaccine, despite lower PT doses. Of 15 serious AEs, none were considered vaccination-related; 1 led to study withdrawal (premature labor, day 364; aP4 group).</p><p>This study confirmed the potential benefits of genetically detoxified PT antigen. All investigational study formulations were well tolerated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>adults</kwd><kwd>genetically detoxified PT</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>persistence</kwd><kwd>pertussis</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium <italic>Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis)</italic>. All age groups are susceptible to pertussis; however, the most severe symptoms occur in infants and young children, in whom potentially fatal complications such as convulsions, bronchopneumonia and encephalopathy may occur.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1&#x02013;3</sup></xref> Household exposure is considered to play an important role in the spread of the disease.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4&#x02013;6</sup></xref> A previous study demonstrated that 35% to 55% of infant cases could be prevented if immunity to pertussis in parents was maintained or boosted.</p><p>Despite the widespread vaccine availability and high vaccination coverage of primary and booster tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccinations, the incidence of pertussis continues to rise in many countries, with the highest morbidity and mortality rates in infants too young to be vaccinated.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7&#x02013;10</sup></xref> It was estimated in 2008 that 16 million cases of pertussis occurred worldwide, and 195,000 children died from the disease, an incidence that owes to insufficient coverage or compliance in pediatric immunization,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11&#x02013;12</sup></xref> as well as to resurgence in countries with high vaccination coverage: a high incidence of pertussis was observed in some developed countries (Australia, Portugal, United Kingdom, United States) that switched vaccination programs from vaccines that contained whole cell pertussis (wP) to aP.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Health agencies in the United States and European Union recommend booster vaccine administration to adults in close contact with infants to reduce the risk of the disease.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14&#x02013;15</sup></xref> As a result of resurgence and increased incidence of infant mortality in 2010&#x02013;2012, several countries including the United States and United Kingdom recommend maternal vaccination during pregnancy to protect newborns against pertussis.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14&#x02013;16</sup></xref></p><p>Currently available aP vaccines with pertussis toxin (PT) and other <italic>B. pertussis</italic> antigens have proven their safety and efficacy in large-scale clinical trials.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17&#x02013;18</sup></xref> However, the increased incidence of pertussis despite high aP coverage suggests that current vaccines induce immunity that may not be long-lasting against circulating strains. The limited longevity of protection against pertussis is also observed following natural infection.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Therefore, a new generation of vaccines (primary and booster combinations) capable of inducing enhanced and long-lasting immunity is warranted. Such vaccines would also be useful for those countries currently using wP combinations, as neither vaccination nor natural immunity are able to confer life-long protection.</p><p>In order to improve disease control and induce enhanced immunity, an alternative method of detoxifying the PT was developed. The genetically detoxified PT (9K/129G) is an inactivated PT mutant that has been shown to be a superior immunogen as compared to the chemically detoxified PT that is currently used in licensed vaccines.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20&#x02013;21</sup></xref> The investigational aP booster vaccine comprising the genetically detoxified PT contains 2 other pertussis antigens (pertactin [PRN] and filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA]), and can be administered alone or in combination with tetanus toxoid (TT) and diphtheria toxoid (DT). The 3 pertussis components had already been included in a DTaP vaccine licensed for pediatric immunization in the 1990's (Triacelluvax, Chiron S.p.A.).

Overall, the safety profile of the investigational aP and TdaP formulations was comparable to the licensed TdaP booster vaccine.</p><p>At least one reactogenicity sign post-vaccination was reported by similar numbers of participants in the aP groups (81% to 88%) and in the licensed comparator group (86%); in the TdaP group, at least one reactogenicity sign post-vaccination was reported by 93% to 98% participants. Similarly, solicited local adverse events (AEs) were reported by 71% to 79% of participants in the aP groups, 83% to 98% in the TdaP groups and by 79% in the comparator group. Solicited systemic AEs were reported by similar numbers of participants in all groups, i.e., 48% to 64% of participants in the aP groups, 43% to 66% in the TdaP groups and 50% in the licensed comparator group. No relevant trends towards higher incidences of solicited AEs with increasing antigen doses were observed in the investigational vaccine groups.</p><p>The most commonly reported local AE was injection site pain, experienced by 71% to 98% of participants in each group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0003">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>). Severe injection site pain was reported by maximum 5% of participants across groups. Erythema was reported by 0% to 14% participants, induration by 2% to 22%; and pruritus by 0% to 14% across groups, with no reports of severe reactions. The most commonly reported systemic AEs occurring across all vaccine groups were fatigue (29% to 49%) and headache (19% to 40%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0003">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>). Severe fatigue was reported by maximum 7% of participants per group, severe headache by maximum 5%. Nausea was experienced by 2% to 17%, myalgia by 10% to 29%, and arthralgia by 0% to 17% of participants across groups, with only few severe reports (up to 5% across groups). Fever &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C was rare, ranging from 0% to 7% across groups. There were no participants with fever &#x02265;40C. Therapeutic use of analgesics and antipyretics was reported in 5% to 20% of participants across vaccine groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0003">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>).

Frequencies of PB, MBC and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the high aP dose group were similar to or higher than those observed for the licensed comparator, which strengthens the arguments that the most appropriate dosage for aP is 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for PT, 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for FHA, and 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for PRN. The high frequency of MBC and PB committed to produce antigen-specific IgG more than IgM speaks in favor of a persisting immunological memory originally primed by vaccination at the pediatric age, despite the lack of detectable antibodies before vaccination. The strong response induced with the genetically detoxified PT also suggests that the genetically detoxified toxin was able to boost a response after priming with cellular wP vaccine. The low CD4+ T cell response observed after in vitro stimulation with the PT, despite the strong antibody and B-cell response, may be due to the treatment PT underwent in order to avoid its intrinsic ability to stimulate T cells non-specifically.</p><p>Study limitations include the absence of predefined hypotheses to be tested formally, despite the relatively large number of participants included for a phase I study. Moreover, no adjustment for multiple testing was performed, so some spurious statistically significant differences between groups may have been observed by chance. For the analysis of antigen-specific cellular responses, the small number of participants analyzed (20 for each group) and the frequently observed non-detectable values for cytokine expression suggested performing just a descriptive analysis, and made it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions. Additionally, the vaccination history of the participants has not been registered, but DTwP vaccination was introduced in Belgium in 1961&#x02013;1962, and considering the age of participants at study enrolment, most &#x02014; if not all &#x02014; participants should have received in infancy the recommended scheme of three doses of DTwP at the ages of 3, 4 and 5 months. Acellular pertussis vaccination was introduced in Belgium in 2001, and since participants in our study were 18&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years old, we could infer that none of the participants have received acellular pertussis vaccine in infancy. Finally, no comparisons were performed between responses from a primary schedule with wP-containing vaccine versus aP-containing vaccine, which would have allowed for further conclusions in terms of global value.</p><p>A lay language graphical summary contextualizing the results and potential clinical research relevance and impact is displayed in the Focus on Patient Section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>).

</p><p>Altogether, this study demonstrates that all study vaccines were well tolerated and confirmed the potential benefit of the genetically detoxified PT antigen. Next steps in development may include further dose finding, assessment of vaccine safety and immunogenicity in vulnerable populations such as elderly and pregnant women, and evaluation of the potential for co-administrations with other vaccines. Also, potential inclusion of genetically detoxified PT in primary childhood vaccines &#x02014; similar to Triacelluvax (DTaP) that demonstrated a long lasting clinical protection<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22&#x02013;24</sup></xref> or in more complex combination vaccines &#x02014; could be considered. Boostability of the genetically detoxified PT formulation itself also remains to be explored. Further studies on adult booster vaccination will be required to assess impact of this vaccine on adult disease, on the transmission dynamics of pertussis in the whole population, and consequently on the protection it may provide for infants who are too young to be immunized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s0004"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Study design and objectives</title><p>The current phase I randomized, controlled, observer-blind, dose-ranging study and extension study was conducted at 1 site in Belgium (Centre for Vaccinology, Ghent University Hospital) between March 2012 and June 2015 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: main study: NCT01529645; extension study: NCT02382913).
