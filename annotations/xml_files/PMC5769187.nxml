It has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT2015053122510N1). The study was performed in the three ICUs of Valiasr Hospital, containing 23 active beds, during 5 months. The sample volume was determined (N = 50) based on previous studies and &#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003b2; = 0.2, p<sub>1</sub>= 19, p<sub>2</sub>= 45, using sample size formula. Thus, 50 unconscious patients in the ICU who had the inclusion criteria were selected through purposive sampling. Patients who were older than 18 years, had been under mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 7 days, and had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of lower than 11, no history of underlying eye disease, no evident injury in the face and eyes, and no blinking reflex were entered into the study. For the random allocation samples to two groups; one eye was assigned to the intervention group and the other to the control group by coin flipping. Therefore, the left eye of half of the patients and the right eye of half of the patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. In order for the care services to be performed in the same way, all colleagues received training on the study objective and care method before the study and were asked to perform care based on the written protocol provided for them. The study began on the first day of hospitalization of the patients and ended on the 7<sup>th</sup> day. The care protocol in the control group consisted of washing the hands before eye care, and using artificial tears (two drops) every 4 h if the eyes are closed. Moreover, it included using simple eye ointment and artificial tears (two drops) every 4 h, closing the eyes with adhesive tape, covering the eye with a pad during suction, evaluating the eyes using fluorescein and an ophthalmoscope with a cobalt blue filter, and informing the physician if any evident damage (white or yellow dots on the surface of the cornea or redness, swelling, and inflammation of the conjunctiva) exists in case of lagophthalmos. In the intervention group, in addition to these measures, NS was used every 6 h.</p><p>The demographic questionnaire consisted of questions on age, gender, disease history, and cause of hospitalization, the status of eyelids, consciousness level, respiratory status, and prescribed drugs. The eyes were examined daily for 7 days by a nurse who had received training in this regard and was approved by an ophthalmologist. The examination was conducted using fluorescein and an ophthalmoscope with a cobalt blue filter. Corneal Changes Rating Scale was used to evaluate the prevalence and severity of keratopathy [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The examiner was blinded to the treatment provided for each eye. The collected data were coded and analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation, and Chi-square test in SPSS software (version 21, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ocular surface disease category</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-23-57-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study was approved by the research committee and ethics Committee (IR.arakmu.rec. 1394.4) of Arak University of Medical Sciences, Iran.

Of the 61 of patients entered into the study, 11 withdrew from the study; six due to death and five due to increased consciousness and regaining of the blinking reflex. Therefore, 50 patients completed the study. The results showed that the majority of subjects were men (31 individuals; 62%) and had a mean age of 62.47 (18.206). The most common causes of hospitalization were cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (20 individuals; 40%) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) (17 individuals; 34%), respectively. The remaining patients were hospitalized due to surgery, intracranial neoplasm, Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS), infection, poisoning, and internal diseases. Among the 50 participants, lagophthalmos was observed in eight (16%) individuals. In each patient, one eye was randomly assigned to the intervention group and the other to the control group; therefore, the two groups were homogeneous in all variables. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the groups in terms of the prevalence and severity of keratopathy before the intervention (day 1) and after the intervention (day 7). The results presented in [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>] show that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups before the intervention (<italic>p</italic> = 0.70 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.70, respectively). Although, the prevalence and severity of keratopathy was higher in the intervention group after the intervention (day 7), this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.50 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.90, respectively). The most important finding of the study was that the increase in prevalence and severity of keratopathy in the control group from day 1 (three individuals) until day 7 (nine individuals) was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10); however, the increased in prevalence and severity of keratopathy in the intervention group was significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). In other words, administration of NS increased the prevalence and severity of keratopathy.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of the prevalence of keratopathy in the two groups before and after the intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-23-57-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the severity of keratopathy in the two groups before and after the intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-23-57-g003"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the present study showed that some patients had keratopathy since the first day of hospitalization in the ICU, and its prevalence and severity increased despite nursing care provision and increased hospitalization duration (7 days). However, this increase was only significant in the intervention group, in which NS was administered in addition to standard care services. The presence of keratopathy on the first day of hospitalization is in agreement with some previous studies. A study conducted on 70 patients who were hospitalized in the ophthalmology ward due to lagophthalmos showed that 40 patients had lagophthalmos at the beginning of the study.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] So <italic>et al</italic>. stated that corneal epithelial abrasion was observed in some patients during the first 24 h of hospitalization in the ICU.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Comorbidities present in the patients may be effective in the incidence of keratopathy on the first day of hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the present study, some patients had been in other wards (e.g., emergency ward) before hospitalization in the ICU and incidence of keratopathy in them may be due to lack of suitable and adequate care services.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the present study, the prevalence and severity of keratopathy had increased in both groups, but this increase was only statistically significant in the intervention group. Some studies have suggested that increase in duration of hospitalization in the ICU can increase the prevalence of keratopathy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, McHugh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Ezra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that increased duration of hospitalization in the ICU did not increase keratopathy incidence. The difference in the findings of these studies may be due to the difference in the eye care provided. Although, there is no consensus on the use of NS as eyewash or eye drop, the results of the present study showed that the use of NS can increase keratopathy in patients hospitalized in the ICU. This finding is in agreement with that of the studies by Desalu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Kalhori <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It has been reported that the stimulatory property of NS can increase tear secretion. Nevertheless, Trees and Tomlinson found no difference in tear evaporation rate immediately after artificial tears and NS use; the natural evaporation duration (returning to baseline) is 9.5 and 37.5 min for artificial tears and NS, respectively. In other words, high tear evaporation rate after NS use may be the cause of dry eyes and keratopathy incidence in critically ill patients.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus, NS use may increase corneal damage and is not recommended.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The findings of this study may assist in the creation of a standard care method in ICUs, increase the knowledge of nurses, and result in the provision of suitable eye care, and thus, reduced eye complications in patients in the ICUs.</p><p>The small sample volume and the simultaneous use of artificial tear drop and NS, in order to control the possible side effects of NS, in the intervention group were the limitations of the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study showed that NS use as eye care in patients in ICUs can increase the prevalence and severity of keratopathy in these critically ill patients. Through the presentation of an eye care method, this study can assist the accurate and timely evaluation of high-risk patients and the prevention and timely treatment of ocular surface diseases, and prevent their progression. Thus, it can be effective in the reduction of the complications and expenses of hospitalization.
