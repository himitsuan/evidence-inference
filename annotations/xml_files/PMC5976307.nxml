As with etomidate, if the MOAA/S scale score was &#x0003e; 3 to maintain appropriate sedation, additional injections were required after at least 60 s of observation.

Both the induction time and total procedure time were recorded by the endoscopist. The 2 nurses and endoscopist recorded the adverse events during the procedure, as well as the duration, onset time, and severity of myoclonus. After the procedure, the endoscopist recorded the physicians&#x02019; satisfaction, sedation level during the procedure, and any adverse events.

For these reasons, we designed a comparison study in which etomidate can be used alternatively even in elderly patients during screening colonoscopy.</p><p>Similar to previous studies, we assumed that the etomidate group had fewer patients with oxygen desaturation and respiratory depression. The incidence of all cardiopulmonary adverse events and VSF was significantly higher in the propofol group. Our study has demonstrated that etomidate&#x02013;midazolam is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and its efficacy is noninferior to that of propofol&#x02013;midazolam in the elderly similar to young patients. However, our experience indicates that patients on etomidate&#x02013;midazolam more often move and have more adverse events disturbing the procedure than those on propofol&#x02013;midazolam, which makes the procedure more difficult for the assistant or nurse than for the endoscopist. Therefore, propofol&#x02013;midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score; however, we recommend using etomidate&#x02013;midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors, as shown by our study results.</p><p>In this study, we included not only healthy patients but also patients with an ASA III score and patients with Mallampati scores of 3 and 4. We demonstrated the sedative efficacy and safety of etomidate&#x02013;midazolam for screening colonoscopy in the elderly and showed that there were more VSF and cardiopulmonary adverse events in the propofol group. This indicated that etomidate&#x02013;midazolam was hemodynamically stable compared to propofol&#x02013;midazolam. In addition, we showed that the etomidate group had lower OR associated with VSF than the propofol group in the multivariate analysis.</p><p>Our study has limitations. First, although the effect of a single injection of etomidate can last up to 72&#x0200a;hours,<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> studies on adrenal insufficiency have not been conducted. Second, we did not study oversedation and undersedation using bispectral index. Third, this randomized controlled trial was conducted at a single center and included a small number of patients. Multicenter randomized trials are required for further confirmation of the results. Fourth, although we intended to assess the efficacy and safety of etomidate&#x02013;midazolam for colonoscopy, about 66% patients underwent both colonoscopy and gastroscopy in this study. The rate of patients who underwent both colonoscopy and gastroscopy was not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, the inclusion of patients who underwent both colonoscopy and gastroscopy may have led to bias.</p><p>In conclusion, we recommend using etomidate&#x02013;midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol&#x02013;midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Hoon Jai Chun.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Jung Min Lee, Geeho Min, Hoon Jai Chun.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Jung Min Lee, Geeho Min, Eun Sun Kim.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Eun Sun Kim.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Seung Han Kim, Bora Keum, Woojung Kim.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Jae Min Lee, Seung Han Kim, Bora Keum, Hong Sik Lee, Beom Jae Lee, Seong Ji Choi, Woojung Kim.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Jae Min Lee, Hyuk Soon Choi, Hoon Jai Chun, Seong Ji Choi.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Bora Keum, Beom Jae Lee.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Jae Min Lee, Hyuk Soon Choi, Jong-Jae Park, Woojung Kim.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Bora Keum, Yoon Tae Jeen, Hoon Jai Chun, Hong Sik Lee, Jong-Jae Park, Beom Jae Lee.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> Yoon Tae Jeen, Hoon Jai Chun, Seong Ji Choi.</p><p><bold>Visualization:</bold> Yoon Tae Jeen.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Jung Min Lee.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Eun Sun Kim, Hong Sik Lee, Chang Duck Kim, Jong-Jae Park.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, ERCP = endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, EUS = endoscopic ultrasound, HR = heart rate, MOAA/S = Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation, OR = odds ratio, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SpO2 = peripheral oxygen saturation, VSF = vital signs fluctuation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017R1C1B5076677) and by Korea University.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name><name><surname>Wieczorek</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
