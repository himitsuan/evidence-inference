These experiments suggested that MSF administered three times per week should provide safe and efficacious AChE inhibition. In a randomized placebo-controlled phase I study, 3.6 mg, 7.2 mg or 10.8 mg MSF were then orally administered to 27 consenting healthy volunteers (aged 50 to 72 years).

Four patients withdrew due to adverse events (AEs) and one for non-compliance. Erythrocyte AChE was inhibited by a total of 33%, 46%, and 62% after 2 weeks of 3.6 mg, 7.2 mg and 10.8 mg MSF, respectively. No serious AEs occurred.

The currently approved drugs have not fulfilled expectations, probably because of tolerability issues rather than lack of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Although CNS acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition may contribute to nausea and vomiting, direct cholinergic overstimulation in peripheral tissues, especially the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal system, may be preventing adequate dosing with current drugs and thereby limiting the realization of the full benefit of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) therapy. Therefore, a ChEI with exceptional CNS selectivity may produce heretofore unrealized efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>].</p><p>An irreversible ChEI has the potential for exceptional selectivity for the CNS, as compared with competitive or pseudo-irreversible inhibitors because the half-time for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of AChE in the CNS is much longer (estimated 12 days) than in the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal system (estimated 1 day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. Therefore, by administering small doses, appropriately spaced in time (e.g. three times per week), greater AChE inhibition is accumulated and maintained in the CNS than in peripheral tissues. Secondly, such a schedule reduces direct patient exposure to the drug to a period of only several hours 3 days per week, leaving the patients essentially drug free most of the time. Exploiting the fundamental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages of an irreversible ChEI may lead to a leap forward in cholinergic therapy.</p><p>Methanesulfonyl fluoride (MSF, SNX-001) is the only truly irreversible ChEI that has been proposed for Alzheimer's therapy. Additionally, the bond between 2,2-dicholorvinyldimethyl phosphate (DDVP), the active metabolite of metrifonate, and the catalytic site of cholinesterase undergoes significant spontaneous hydrolysis, producing inhibition with a half-life of only several hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Metrifonate development was curtailed because of the appearance of muscular and respiratory paralysis, complications of organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. It is important to note that the sulfonyl fluorides, like carbamates (e.g. rivastigmine), do not produce organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>] and specifically MSF, by comparison, does not inhibit the target enzyme associated with this disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. There is also no spontaneous hydrolysis of the MSF&#x02013;cholinesterase bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>].</p><p>MSF was well tolerated in a small phase I study and showed some promise as a treatment for dementia in a small double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase II trial, producing 7 to 8 points improvement on the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale &#x02013; Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) as compared with controls after 8 weeks treatment, a 20% improvement over baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. However, a continuing concern about irreversible ChEIs is safety. Therefore, the purpose of the present studies was to explore further the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of MSF in animal and human studies including a double-blind randomized escalating dose phase I study in healthy aged subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal experiments</title><p>The animal studies were reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and conform to the PHS <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Animals</italic>.</p><sec><title>Pharmacodynamic study</title><p>Ten 6 month old female Sprague Dawley rats (mean weight 280 g) reared at U.T.

In this case, MSF produced relatively short acting biological effects in peripheral tissues, and less accumulated AChE inhibition in peripheral tissues because of rapid <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. Long-acting biological effects were observed in the CNS, with high accumulation, because of very slow <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. The relatively slow <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of AChE in the brain, compared with peripheral tissues, is the key advantage of an irreversible inhibitor such as MSF in the treatment of a CNS disorder.</p><p>The PK of MSF in both humans and animals show that it is cleared from the blood rapidly and almost completely by 12 h in humans. The human data also show an orderly dose-dependent plasma concentration with no evidence of accumulation or change with repeated dosing. These data indicate that patients receiving MSF on a schedule of three doses per week would have limited direct exposure to the drug only on drug days and would be drug-free the remaining days of the week.</p><p>Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be useful in monitoring steady-state CNS AChE inhibition induced by competitive or pseudo-irreversible inhibitors, it is not suitable as a direct measure of MSF-induced CNS inhibition because the effects of an irreversible inhibitor do not depend on maintaining a steady-state concentration. Furthermore, the apparent inhibition is diluted out because of the high turnover rate of CSF. Human CSF AChE has a half-time of 2.21 (&#x000b1;1.22) days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], a period too short to be useful for measuring the accumulated inhibition that accrues from an irreversible inhibitor given every 2 to 3 days. However, 80% cortex AChE inhibition has been found by cortical biopsies in monkeys (<italic>M. fasicularis</italic>) 2.5 days after the last of 2 months of repeated high doses of MSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>], confirming a robust CNS AChE inhibition that has also been observed in rodents at more clinically relevant doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]).</p><p>Furthermore, the finding of 80% AChE inhibition in the monkey brain 2.5 days after the last dose of MSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] suggests a minimum possible turnover rate of 8 days (if recovery had started from 100% inhibition). These same experiments showed that the turnover rate of monkey CSF AChE was 2.37 days, similar to that observed in humans, confirming that the turnover rate of CNS AChE is slower than CSF AChE.</p><p>A better, less invasive estimate of the CNS effect is obtained from measurements of AChE inhibition in erythrocytes if the difference in half-time for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in erythrocytes and brain is taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. By modelling the timing of the doses, the percent inhibition produced by each dose, and the recovery of AChE activity from <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis between doses, reiterative computations can estimate the accumulation of AChE in the brain. They have correctly predicted the CNS accumulation of AChE inhibition in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. Based upon the above finger prick data showing that doses of 3.6 mg, 7.2 mg, and 10.8 mg produce 6.6%, 11.5%, and 18.1%, respectively, each time they are given, three times per week for 2 weeks against <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of AChE with an estimated half-time of 12 days in the CNS, these calculations lead to an estimated accumulated AChE inhibition in the brain of 26%, 41% and 56% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>].</p><p>The highest MSF dose (10.8 mg) in the present study corresponds to the dose of 0.18 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (60 kg patient) used in an earlier phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>] which found similar accumulated human erythrocyte AChE inhibition, adjusted for dosing for 2 months instead of 2 weeks. The AChE inhibition observed in the erythrocytes and estimated in the CNS for the highest dose in the present study seem to be at a therapeutic level insofar as similar inhibition was found in an earlier phase II trial that resulted in good clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that, as expected, the estimated accumulated AChE inhibition in the brain is less than that measured in the erythrocytes. This is because the erythrocytes have a longer half-time for <italic>de novo</italic> AChE synthesis (estimated 45 days, determined by the appearance of new erythrocytes) than in the CNS (estimated 12 days). Therefore, the use of erythrocyte AChE inhibition to estimate AChE inhibition in the brain requires PD calculations that take into account the shorter half-time in the brain.</p><p>In summary, it appears that the cumulative effect of MSF may be adequately monitored by erythrocyte AChE inhibition and the finger prick method offers a suitable, minimally invasive method of assessing drug action on its molecular target.</p><p>The results of the present phase I study suggest that MSF is potentially suitable as a treatment for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The dosing schedule of three times per week seems to be desirable for practical clinical use because it minimizes direct patient exposure to the drug in the blood. Also, erythrocyte AChE inhibition in the range of 33% to 67% appears to be well tolerated and, at the high end, correlated with good efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>].</p><p>As an irreversible inhibitor of AChE, MSF produces high levels of AChE inhibition in the brain by taking advantage of the very slow half-time for AChE <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. This helps separate the therapeutic effect of MSF in the brain from the undesired peripheral cholinergic side effects that are commonly experienced with the currently available short-acting AChEIs which also may limit dosing to what can be tolerated by the patients. An irreversible AChE inhibitor such as MSF should produce more pronounced and longer lasting potentiation of central cholinergic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>], enhanced clinical efficacy, and a fuller exploration of the real potential of AChE inhibition for the treatment of memory deficits in both vascular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>] and degenerative forms of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Viviana Vigil and Stephanie Quezada for assistance with the
