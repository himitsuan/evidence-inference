There is evidence that home-based programmes of cognitive stimulation delivered by family caregivers may benefit both the person and the caregiver. However, no previous studies have evaluated caregiver-delivered CST. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based, caregiver-led individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) program in (i) improving cognition and quality of life (QoL) for the person with dementia and (ii) mental and physical health (well-being) for the caregiver.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>A single-blind, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at eight study sites across the United Kingdom. The intervention and blinded assessment of outcomes were conducted in participants&#x02019; homes. Three hundred fifty-six people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were recruited from memory services and community mental health teams (CMHTs).</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to iCST (75, 30-min sessions) or treatment as usual (TAU) control over 25 wk. iCST sessions consisted of themed activities designed to be mentally stimulating and enjoyable. Caregivers delivering iCST received training and support from an unblind researcher.</p><p>Primary outcomes were cognition (Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale&#x02013;cognitive [ADAS-Cog]) and self-reported QoL (Quality of Life Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease [QoL-AD]) for the person with dementia and general health status (Short Form-12 health survey [SF-12]) for the caregiver. Secondary outcomes included quality of the caregiving relationship from the perspectives of the person and of the caregiver (Quality of the Carer Patient Relationship Scale) and health-related QoL (European Quality of Life&#x02013;5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]) for the caregiver.</p><p>Intention to treat (ITT) analyses were conducted. At the post-test (26 wk), there were no differences between the iCST and TAU groups in the outcomes of cognition (mean difference [MD] = &#x02212;0.55, 95% CI &#x02212;2.00&#x02013;0.90; <italic>p</italic> = 0.45) and self-reported QoL (MD = &#x02212;0.02, 95% CI &#x02212;1.22&#x02013;0.82; <italic>p</italic> = 0.97) for people with dementia, or caregivers&#x02019; general health status (MD = 0.13, 95% CI &#x02212;1.65&#x02013;1.91; <italic>p</italic> = 0.89). However, people with dementia receiving iCST rated the relationship with their caregiver more positively (MD = 1.77, 95% CI 0.26&#x02013;3.28; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), and iCST improved QoL for caregivers (EQ-5D, MD = 0.06, 95% CI 0.02&#x02013;0.10; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Forty percent (72/180) of dyads allocated to iCST completed at least two sessions per week, with 22% (39/180) completing no sessions at all. Study limitations include low adherence to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There was no evidence that iCST has an effect on cognition or QoL for people with dementia.

Amongst those that enhance the QOL of people with dementia, cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has a robust evidence base [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and has been shown to improve patient QoL and cognition and also to be cost-effective [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An extended programme of maintenance CST (CST plus an additional 24 weekly sessions) was found to improve QoL [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cognitive stimulation is based on the theory of &#x0201c;use it or lose it,&#x0201d; whereby mental stimulation may counter or slow cognitive decline, and evidence that activation of neurons may enhance neuronal function and survival [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CST sessions are designed to provide general stimulation of a range of cognitive skills through enjoyable activities in a social setting, although language appears to be particularly affected [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further investigation of CST&#x02019;s impact on QoL indicates that the domains of energy level, memory, ability to do chores, and relationship with caregiver are most responsive to improvement, and that improvements in QoL may be mediated by improvements in cognition [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Typically, CST is delivered in day centres or residential care facilities, without the family caregiver. The stress-health model suggests that improvements in QOL and cognition from CST may improve caregiver outcomes, but few studies have examined this [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Many of the therapies currently available are directed at either caregivers or people with dementia, but a meta-analysis of psychological interventions for caregivers suggests that interventions are less efficacious when they target caregivers alone [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Home-based, multi-component dyadic interventions, engaging both the caregiver and the person with dementia, have been found to yield a range of benefits, including reduction in behavioural symptoms [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], reduction in negative caregiver reactions [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and reduction in nursing home admissions [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The current evidence on both caregiver-focused and dyadic interventions also suggests that delivery one to one is more effective than in a group [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>This suggests that a home-based, one-to-one version of CST led by a family caregiver may yield benefits for both the person and the caregiver. Few studies have focused on the use of cognitive stimulation&#x02013;based programmes delivered in the home, and CST has never been directly adapted for use in this context. However, a small study of home-based memory management by family caregivers with psychoeducation improved memory in the person with dementia, improved caregiver well-being, and reduced care home admissions by 18 mo follow-up [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

A further potential benefit of developing a home-based version of CST would be increasing the accessibility of the intervention for people unable to get to groups due to health/mobility problems, lack of groups in the local area, or preference not to participate in group activities [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the individual CST (iCST) trial was to investigate the primary outcomes of whether family caregiver-delivered CST improves (i) cognition and QoL of people with dementia and (ii) mental and physical health of caregivers. We hypothesised iCST may elicit cognitive benefits for the following reasons: (i) the programme provides mental stimulation through multisensory activities exercising a range of cognitive skills (e.g., memory, communication) in an environment that supports learning [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; (ii) like CST, iCST focuses on implicit memory, which tends to be maintained longer than explicit memory and, moreover, responds to stimulation [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; (iii) discussion of new thoughts and ideas, and making associations (key principle of iCST) stimulates language [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The existing evidence on group CST and other individual family-led cognitive interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also supports the choice of cognitive change as a primary outcome in this trial. QoL was also chosen as a primary outcome because (i) improvements in cognitive function appear to mediate improvements in QoL; therefore, if iCST benefitted people cognitively as predicted, we expected to observe an associated positive impact on QoL, and (ii) cognitive stimulation has consistently been found to improve QoL [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Secondary outcomes for people with dementia included behavioural and psychological symptoms, activities of daily living, depressive symptoms, and the quality of the caregiving relationship. We posited that iCST may improve the caregiving relationship because (i) improving cognition may help people communicate more effectively with their caregiver, which is associated with higher relationship satisfaction [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and (ii) the programme provides an opportunity for people and their caregivers to participate in enjoyable activities together [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, enhancing the quality of the caregiving relationship may also improve QoL for the person with dementia [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], supporting selection of QoL as a primary outcome in this trial.</p><p>For caregivers, health-related QoL, mood symptoms, resilience, and relationship quality were secondary outcomes. We hypothesised that participating in activities together may help caregivers develop or maintain a closer relationship with the person they are caring for, and focusing these kinds of positive aspects of caregiving may improve well-being and reduce stress and burden [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

In relation to other activities, there was no difference between the intervention and TAU groups at BL or post-test in terms of day centre attendance, lunch club attendance, or education classes.</p><table-wrap id="pmed.1002269.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1002269.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of person with dementia and caregiver.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pmed.1002269.t001g" xlink:href="pmed.1002269.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic<break/>Person with dementia</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total (%)<break/>(<italic>n</italic> = 356)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">iCST (%)<break/>(<italic>n</italic> = 180)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TAU (%)<break/>(<italic>n</italic> = 176)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165/356 (46)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83/180 (46)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82/176 (47)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ethnicity: white</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">331/356 (93)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164/180 (91)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167/176 (95)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Marital status: married/cohabiting/civil partnership</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">252/356 (71)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">125/180 (69)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">127/176 (72)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lives with spouse/partner</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">225/356 (63)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">113/180 (63)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112/176 (64)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Highest level of education school leaver (14&#x02013;16 y)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">213/356 (60)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">113/180 (63)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100/176 (57)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-cholinesterase inhibitors</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">270/356 (76)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">136/180 (76)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">134/176 (76)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Caregiver</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">261/356 (73)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">135/180 (75)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">126/176 (72)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ethnicity: white</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">329/356 (92)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164/180 (91)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166/176 (94)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Marital status: married/cohabiting/civil partnership</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">297/356 (83)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">149/180 (83)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">148/176 (84)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Highest level of education school leaver (14&#x02013;16 y)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156/356 (44)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79/180 (44)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80/176 (45)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>iCST, individual cognitive stimulation therapy; TAU, treatment as usual.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Researcher ratings of perceived group allocation</title><p>The response rate for the researcher perceived group allocation questionnaires (see Table D and Table E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002269.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) was high at the 13-wk mid-point (92%, 264/288) and post-test (93%, 255/273).

The most frequent reported category of SAE was &#x0201c;hospitalisation&#x0201d; (63%, 32/51), of which there were 16 instances in each group. There were more deaths in the TAU group (8/10) than the iCST group (2/10). Five SAEs categorised as &#x0201c;life-threatening&#x0201d; were recorded in total, three of which occurred in the iCST group, and four &#x0201c;medically significant&#x0201d; SAEs occurred in the iCST group. For three people with dementia, two SAEs were reported, which were hospitalisations followed by death. We judged that none were definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment received within the trial, either iCST or TAU.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec038"><title>Discussion</title><p>We undertook a pragmatic RCT to evaluate the impact of a programme of individual, home-based CST on cognition and QoL of people with dementia and mental and physical health of caregivers. No significant differences were found between the iCST and TAU groups for the primary outcomes of cognition and QoL for people with dementia and mental and physical health for caregivers. iCST appeared to enhance the quality of the caregiving relationship from the person with dementia&#x02019;s perspective. In addition, the caregivers in the intervention group benefitted in terms of improvements in QoL (EQ-5D). Analyses incorporating level of adherence to the iCST programme (number of sessions completed) revealed that people with dementia who participated in more sessions were more likely to experience gains in the relationship with their caregiver at the primary end point of the study (26 wk), and caregivers who completed more sessions had fewer depressive symptoms. The EQ-5D demonstrated improvements in QoL for caregivers, but there was no difference in general health status (SF-12). The discrepancy in findings between these two measures may be related to inherent differences in the measures or their sensitivity to change.</p><p>With a total of 356 participating pairs, to our knowledge, this is the largest trial of a CST-based approach. The trial also represents an innovation in CST, as previously the intervention had been delivered only in groups without caregivers. A potential limitation of this trial is the low levels of adherence to the intervention. Because less than half of the iCST group completed at least two sessions per week (72/180, 40%) and 22% (39/180) did not complete any sessions, the power of the study to identify significant differences in outcomes between the iCST and TAU groups may have been compromised.</p><p>Data from the development phase of the trial and qualitative data gathered from post-trial interviews may yield insight into the reasons for low levels of adherence. The principal reason for nonadherence in the field-testing study was difficulty fitting iCST into a busy schedule [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In post-trial interviews challenges that hindered adherence included difficulty engaging the person in the activities, which in some cases was due to the activities being too easy, poor health of the person with dementia, and having a negative outlook about the progressive nature of dementia, which may have affected caregiver motivation to deliver the intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It may be that the intervention is simply not suitable for all and that there are particular characteristics of (i) the context in which the intervention is delivered (e.g., relationships, health, life events), (ii) the person delivering the intervention (e.g., motivation, personality), and (iii) the person receiving the intervention, which act as mediators of successful engagement in and adherence to the programme. More detailed investigation of these factors in order to discern their impact on adherence would be useful in future research.</p><p>We were able to standardise the training and support in order to maximise treatment adherence and fidelity. However, the quality of support and training provided may have varied between sites, as it was delivered by a number of researchers with various levels of experience, skills, and qualifications. In terms of the extent to which the engagement strategies embedded into the trial (e.g., training, support, monitoring visits) were effective overall, data from the adherence questionnaires completed by caregivers at setup, MV1, and MV2 suggest the training and support provided by researchers was more than adequate; therefore, these components may not account for poor adherence.</p><p>Caregiver ratings of confidence in delivery and knowledge of iCST were very high and significantly improved from setup to MV2. In addition, we observed significant improvements in caregivers&#x02019; ability to apply the key principles and use the skills and techniques related to iCST. Despite this, caregivers did not perceive any corresponding improvements in the person with dementia&#x02019;s engagement. From a fidelity perspective, these data suggest that caregivers felt they were delivering the intervention as intended and as they had been trained. However, a limitation of self-report methods such as questionnaires in lieu of more involved measures of fidelity such as researcher observation of sessions or audio/video recording is that it is difficult to closely monitor exactly what was delivered. In contrast with the findings from the training and monitoring visits, some caregivers who were interviewed post trial reported that they did not feel skilled enough to deliver the intervention and that the time between monitoring visits was too long. New paradigms in the design of pragmatic trials outline how &#x0201c;implementation errors&#x0201d; such as low treatment fidelity can be avoided [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Blinding to allocation appeared successful for the most part, with the majority of researchers reporting dyads equally likely to be in the iCST or TAU groups. Dyads were reminded not to disclose their allocation to visiting researchers. However, on rare occasions, they did share this information or left iCST materials on show, which were seen by the researcher during the 13-wk mid-point or post-test assessment visit. If researchers were unblinded at the 13-wk mid-point, they were typically advised not to conduct the post-test assessment if possible.</p><p>In terms of external validity, the intervention was tested in a wide diversity of urban and rural areas across eight sites in the UK. Despite this, there was a lack of variation in ethnicities of participants, which may affect scope for generalisation of results. Neither can we be sure the programme is suitable or acceptable across different cultures with the current data we have. The group CST programme has been successfully adapted for a wide range of cultures, with guidelines published to assist this process [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]; thus, iCST could be similarly tailored. Although, like CST, iCST was intended for people with mild to moderate dementia, most participants had mild dementia, and so it may be difficult to generalise the findings to people with moderate dementia. A further limitation of the trial is that the effect sizes for the significant improvements observed in relationship quality from the person with dementia&#x02019;s perspective and caregiver QoL are small. Consequently, the extent to which the findings translate to tangible clinical or real-life benefits is hard to determine, particularly because investment of time and resources is necessary in order to deliver this intervention. However, there was a lot of feedback from people to indicate that the iCST activities were meaningful, enjoyable, and stimulating, suggesting that they may play a useful role as part of better care [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>This trial contributes further to the body of knowledge of dyadic psychosocial interventions and demonstrates the benefits of relationship-centred care. The findings support the use of mentally stimulating activities as a means of improving outcomes for people with dementia and their caregivers [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Whilst CST is categorised as an intervention for people with dementia, the involvement of a family caregiver in the delivery of iCST and the observed positive impact of the sessions on both the person and the caregiver categorise iCST as a multi-component intervention. iCST provides caregivers with training and the manual with guidance and key principles that may be psychoeducational. iCST may also have elements of a support intervention, as caregivers were in regular telephone contact with researchers.</p><p>Improvements in the quality of the caregiving relationship were only demonstrated from the person with dementia&#x02019;s perspective. Whilst caregiver QoL improved, the person with dementia&#x02019;s QoL did not. This suggests that iCST may offer mutual, caregiver-specific, and patient-specific benefits. The sessions present opportunities for joint activities between the person and the caregiver, which may contribute to the positive outcomes each experienced.</p><p>Hellstrom, Nolan, and Lundh found caregivers and people with dementia identified four activities they felt &#x0201c;sustained couplehood&#x0201d;: &#x0201c;talking things through,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;being appreciative and affectionate,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;making the best of things,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;keeping the peace&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The iCST programme and key principles correspond to each of these needs, which may account for our findings. In terms of &#x0201c;talking things through&#x0201d; iCST activities facilitate discussion and may reinforce positive patterns of communication, which may transfer to interactions outside the sessions. Affection and appreciation may be demonstrated in the supportive and fun atmosphere that sessions are intended to create. Pairs may view participating in activities together as a source of enjoyment related to &#x0201c;making the best of things.&#x0201d; Finally, the iCST key principle of &#x0201c;focusing on opinions rather than facts&#x0201d; may contribute to &#x0201c;keeping the peace&#x0201d; by reducing criticism and celebrating success rather than dwelling on failure.</p><p>Providing enjoyable activities for a person with dementia can improve caregiver well-being [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; thus, adopting a facilitative role in iCST sessions may be the mechanism responsible for the observed improvements in caregiver QoL. This appears plausible given our finding that caregivers who delivered more iCST sessions had fewer depressive symptoms.</p><p>The finding that the iCST programme did not significantly affect cognition contrasts with previous studies of group CST [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, significant QoL benefits for people with dementia were not detected in this trial, despite being consistently associated with both short- and longer-term programmes of group CST [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The social setting and additional stimulation from participating in a group context may account for the difference in outcomes between iCST and group CST. Woods and colleagues suggest that the reported QOL benefits associated with CST are likely to be mediated by improvements in cognition [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, the lack of significant cognitive change experienced by people with dementia may account for our lack of findings on QOL outcomes. Alternatively, an optimum &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of iCST may be necessary to impact cognition. There is evidence to suggest that two sessions of group CST per week are associated with cognitive benefits, whereas once weekly sessions are not [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Given 22% (39/180) of the sample did not complete any iCST sessions and adherence was generally low, people may not have received enough stimulation to benefit. The dyads who were either too busy or no longer wanted to participate amounted to just under 40% (18/46) of the total withdrawals, so in future studies, it is possible that with alternative approaches to retention and closer monitoring, some of these may have been persuaded to stay in the trial.</p><p>Given some people with dementia and their family caregivers did not fully engage in iCST, the trial could be replicated with enhanced processes to support better adherence. In the development phase of this trial, delivery by paid caregivers was suggested as an alternative if family caregivers were not willing or able to deliver iCST, and field-testing with a sample of paid caregivers demonstrated this was feasible [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, future research should investigate how far adherence can be improved if the intervention is delivered by a health care professional or paid caregiver.</p><p>Although iCST does not appear to deliver clinical benefits for cognition and QoL for people with dementia, there was evidence of improvement in terms of the caregiving relationship from the person with dementia&#x02019;s perspective. There was also evidence of improvement in caregivers&#x02019; QoL and depressive symptoms for those who completed more sessions. From a clinical perspective, reduction in depressive symptoms and improved QoL of the caregiver by means of a low-cost, non-drug intervention are worthwhile outcomes. The longer-term associated effect of reducing depression may be that caregivers remain better mentally and perhaps physically (as a related consequence) for longer. This carries possible advantages such as prolonging their ability to provide care for the person with dementia, reduced instances of crises requiring intervention (e.g., emergency temporary hospitalisation), and less burden on health and social care services, as their health is maintained with less need for additional resources (e.g., medication, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy). Enhancing the caregiving relationship through iCST may reduce the risk of presentation to services and deterioration of the person&#x02019;s functioning, which has been associated with conflict in the caregiving relationship [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In turn, risk of institutionalisation may be reduced or delayed, which is important from a societal and cost perspective, as the cost of residential care is high [<xref rid="pmed.1002269.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This indicates that iCST may be introduced as a useful component of individually tailored home care packages, which may also help maintain people with dementia in their home situation for longer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec039"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002269.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002269.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002269.s002"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002269.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002269.s003"><label>S1 iCST Materials list</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002269.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the people with dementia and their family caregivers who took part in the iCST trial and development studies for their time and contributions.
