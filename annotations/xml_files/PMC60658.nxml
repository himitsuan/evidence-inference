Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have highlighted the possible association between antihypertensive therapy and both intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small for gestational age birthweight (SGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], especially with the use of beta-blockers (&#x003b2;b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Pooling data from these clinical trials is questionable, however, because of large differences in design, patient characteristics and the various therapies studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When the results of clinical trials were systematically analyzed on an individual basis, without pooling, there was no evidence for fetal harm or growth restriction with &#x003b2;b use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], with the exception of one small trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite the availability of level I evidence, knowledge about the effects of &#x003b2;b and other antihypertensive drugs on perinatal health remains limited. For example, few studies have evaluated the use of multiple drug therapy in pregnancy, especially within a routine clinical practice setting. Second, previous studies that compared &#x003b2;b with other antihypertensive agents typically enrolled fewer than 100 women, thereby lacking adequate statistical power to address rare but important adverse perinatal events, including perinatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, we undertook a study of the association between antihypertensive drug use in pregnancy and the risk of major perinatal events, while controlling for other important determinants of perinatal well-being. Our primary goal was to examine whether &#x003b2;bs were associated with higher perinatal morbidity and mortality compared to either no therapy or use of non-&#x003b2;b antihypertensive agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>We conducted a cohort study from January 1986 to December 1995. We prospectively enrolled all pregnant women whose sitting systolic blood pressure was &#x02265; 140 mm Hg or whose diastolic pressure was &#x02265; 90 mm Hg. All participants were originally seen through the Obstetrics Service at the McMaster University Medical Center, either on an outpatient or inpatient basis. The patients were consecutively recruited before delivery, and accounted for approximately 98 percent of all hypertensive pregnant women who delivered at our hospital. McMaster University Medical Centre is a major referral center for high-risk obstetrics patients and has a level III nursery.</p><p>Each participant's hospital identification number was recorded at the time of presentation, and mother and infant data were subsequently abstracted from their hospital charts by two authors (R.B. and E.B.) three months after the patient's date of confinement. The three-month delay allowed for the recording of complete information on early infant outcomes. Data were recorded using a standard data collection form and entered into a computer database (SPSS, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p><p>The four types of hypertension in pregnancy were classified according to the taxonomy and definitions of the 1990 National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Hence, women with <italic>de novo</italic> pregnancy-acquired hypertension were sub-divided into those with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, while those with chronic hypertension (i.e., hypertension before 20 weeks gestation) were separated into those with or without superimposed preeclampsia. The development of preeclampsia was defined by hypertension in association with the presence of at least 2+ proteinuria or 300 mg of urinary protein per 24-hour specimen collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Antihypertensive drug use</title><p>Antihypertensive drug use was defined as the receipt of at least one dose of that agent, regardless of the route of administration, dose or duration of use, gestational age at initiation, or type or degree of hypertension. Information on the drug dose or its duration of use was not recorded. Antihypertensive agents were classified as &#x003b2;bs (i.e., atenolol, propranolol, metoprolol, acebutatolol or labetolol), non-&#x003b2;b drugs (i.e., nifedipine, methyldopa, hydralazine, captopril, enalapril, furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide), or combined/multiple concomitant therapy (i.e., &#x003b2;b plus non-&#x003b2;b drug). Magnesium sulphate was not considered to be an antihypertensive drug.</p><p>Although no formal standard for the use of antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy was in effect at McMaster University, there was a general consensus among the attending Obstetricians and Perinatologists. Therapy was typically administered to women whose BP was greater than 140/90 mm Hg in the presence of proteinuria, headache, or symptoms suggestive of preeclampsia, and at a BP greater than 150/95 mm Hg in the absence of any symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Perinatal outcomes</title><p>The primary study outcome was the composite of either a disease of prematurity (i.e., necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular hemorrhage and/or hyaline membrane disease), need for assisted ventilation for greater than 1 day, and/or perinatal death after 20 weeks gestation and up to 30 days after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Secondary outcomes included SGA, defined as a birthweight below the 10th centile for gestational age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; preterm birth before 32 or 37 weeks gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; development of one or more diseases of prematurity; need for mechanical ventilation for greater than 1 day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; perinatal death; or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In the main analysis, the association between antihypertensive drug use (i.e., &#x003b2;b drugs, non-&#x003b2;b drugs, or a combination of both) was compared to non-use as the referent for each study outcome. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, estimates of the odds ratio were adjusted for maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy weight (by quartiles), history of delivery before 34 weeks, history of hypertension in a previous pregnancy, cigarette smoking, pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus, pre-pregnancy renal dysfunction, use of prednisone, receipt of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity (not included in the analyses of SGA and preterm delivery), and gestational age at which blood pressure (BP) first increased above 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of a potentially longer duration of drug use, we conducted a subgroup analysis of women with hypertension before 20 weeks gestation, using the same exposure variables as in the main analysis. Individual study outcomes included the primary composite outcome of perinatal morbidity and mortality, SGA, and preterm birth before 32 and 37 weeks gestation. We adjusted for the variables included in the main analysis, in addition to the presence of preeclampsia, but no longer controlled for the gestational age at which the BP first rose above 140/90 mm Hg. Preeclampsia was included to account for the possible confounding effect of superimposed preeclampsia on preterm birth, SGA or the diseases of prematurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the main analysis, baseline maternal characteristics were compared across groups using either one-way ANOVA for continuous variables or the chi-square test for categorical data. All p-values were two-sided, and significance was set at a value of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). The McMaster University Medical Ethics Committee was consulted at the commencement of the study in 1986. The committee determined that formal consent was not required because all maternal and newborn personal identifiers were omitted during data entry, which preserved patient anonymity and prevented future patient contact.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During the study period, there were 21 723 births at McMaster University Medical Centre.

The greatest risks for adverse perinatal outcomes were related to the combined use of &#x003b2;b and non-&#x003b2;b medications. All forms of antihypertensive therapy were associated with a higher risk for SGA, preterm birth and admission to the NICU, and multiple therapy had the strongest association with these events. Similar relationships were evident in the sub-group of women with chronic hypertension during pregnancy, except that use of a non-&#x003b2;b drug was not associated with SGA or preterm birth before 32 weeks.</p><p>Several study limitations should caution the reader from drawing definitive conclusions about the impact of antihypertensive therapy on perinatal outcome. First, we did not obtain information on drug dose, duration of use or route of administration. Thus, this study provides no information about the existence of a dose-response relationship between drug use and adverse perinatal events. Because this was not a randomized clinical trial, bias due to confounding by indication was likely present, in that women with milder forms of hypertension may have received lower doses of oral therapy (e.g., atenolol), while those with more severe hypertension were probably prescribed a higher dose of an intravenous medication (e.g., hydralazine). However, we do know that because the most commonly used agents in this study &#x02013; atenolol, nifedipine and methyldopa &#x02013; were not available intravenously, their use probably extended beyond the acute management of severe maternal hypertension with impending delivery. Similarly, although we did not discriminate between the types of &#x003b2;b prescribed in our study sample, or between the various types of non-&#x003b2;b drugs, we may assume that most of these relationships are reflective of the use of atenolol, nifedipine and methyldopa.</p><p>&#x003b2;b medications are contraindicated in individuals with specific diseases like asthma, a common condition whose presence in pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia, preterm delivery and SGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Accordingly, absence of &#x003b2;b use may have been confounded by the presence of other diseases like asthma, which could explain the relatively lower degree of perinatal morbidity with &#x003b2;b therapy compared to non-&#x003b2;b treatments. Similarly, there may have been a lower threshold for induction of labor or Cesarean delivery among women who were referred to our center for the management of more complex or severe maternal hypertension or fetal disease. Thus, because these data may be biased, and their internal and external validity questioned, they may not be applicable to some women with stable, mild and asymptomatic hypertension.</p><p>Two Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews have examined the use of &#x003b2;bs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] as well as all types of medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] for the treatment of pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension. In the first review, comprising 14 randomized trials of oral &#x003b2;bs versus placebo or no therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], &#x003b2;bs decreased the risk of progression to severe hypertension (relative risk [RR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.26&#x02013;0.53) and the need for additional antihypertensive drugs (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31&#x02013;0.62) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, there was insufficient data to draw conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm delivery, but &#x003b2;bs were minimally associated with SGA (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.79). Among 11 trials, &#x003b2;bs appeared to be both equally effective and as safe as methyldopa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the second review, comparing antihypertensive drugs with placebo or no treatment, active therapy reduced the risk of severe hypertension (24 trials; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41&#x02013;0.64), but not preeclampsia (19 trials; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84&#x02013;1.18), perinatal death (23 trials; RR 0.71, 0.46&#x02013;1.09), preterm birth (12 trials; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85&#x02013;1.13), or SGA (17 trials; RR 1.13, 0.91&#x02013;1.42) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, within a heterogeneous group of randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, whether in the form of &#x003b2;bs or other drugs, remains controversial.</p><p>The advantage of a large, prospective study like MOS HIP 2 is its ability to examine several important "hard" perinatal outcomes, and to generate estimates of effect size with statistical certainty. MOS HIP 2 provided information on perinatal outcomes within the realm of clinical practice, and included a broad array of women with different mechanisms and degrees of hypertension. By adjusting for multiple potential confounders, such as the gestational age at which the BP rose, we may have reduced the likelihood that antihypertensive drug use was merely a marker of both the acuity and degree of hypertension and, accordingly, the associated risk of preterm delivery and neonatal prematurity. Similarly, by limiting our sub-group analysis to women with chronic hypertension, we increased the likelihood that maternal exposure to antihypertensive therapy would be of longer duration. In doing so, there remained no relationship between &#x003b2;b use and the primary endpoint of major perinatal disease or death, an association that was observed for both non-&#x003b2;b and combination drug therapy.</p><p>The debate about whether &#x003b2;b drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] or antihypertensive treatment in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] may cause IUGR neither begins nor ends with the current study. Even randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] of active therapy are biased by the presence of co-intervention, cross-over, contamination and drop-outs. For example, in a well-publicized clinical trial by Butters et al., 33 women with mild primary hypertension were randomized to atenolol or placebo at approximately 16 weeks gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Infants of mothers assigned atenolol weighed an average of 910 g less than those in the placebo group, but four women in the placebo group withdrew from the study. A second trial compared atenolol with placebo for the treatment of mild gestational hypertension during the third trimester, with no difference in birthweight between groups; however, data were reported on only 85 of 120 women (70.8%) randomized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A recent clinical trial randomized 56 asymptomatic women with an increased cardiac output before 24 weeks gestation to either atenolol or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For the primary outcome of preeclampsia, the relative risk was 0.3 (95% CI 0.07&#x02013;1.4) in favor of atenolol, and only in the small sub-group of nulliparous women was treatment with atenolol significantly associated with a 440 g mean lower mean birthweight (p = 0.02). Thus, although it is possible that atenolol may cause some degree of growth restriction, this has not been demonstrated when the drug is compared to another form of active treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], or in the presence of more severe hypertension, when maternal benefit may be greater. Finally, no class effect has been demonstrated for &#x003b2;bs in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>It may not be surprising that the risk of preterm delivery in our study was significantly associated with the use of antihypertensive therapy, since the initiation of therapy might simply reflect the onset of either new or worsening hypertension and the need for delivery. However, it is possible that &#x003b2;bs possess tocophilic properties that could predispose a woman to preterm labor. At least two placebo-controlled clinical trials have used intravenous &#x003b2;bs in the management of dysfunctional labor, reporting lower rates of Caesarian delivery with active treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The relative degree of association observed in this study was substantially lower with &#x003b2;b than non-&#x003b2;b antihypertensive drugs, for delivery before 32 (OR 7.6 versus OR 13.4 among all women, respectively) or 37 weeks (OR 5.1 versus OR 10.3, respectively).</p><p>Combined antihypertensive therapy was a strong marker for preterm birth and a moderate indicator of SGA. Interestingly, however, the associated risk for other serious perinatal outcomes, such as the primary composite outcome, was either less than or similar to that for monotherapy with a non-&#x003b2;b drug (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Further research might investigate whether there are differences in placental blood flow and fetal growth according to treatment regimen (monotherapy vs. combined antihypertensive therapy).</p><p>Although no significant association was seen between &#x003b2;b use and major perinatal morbidity or mortality, it cannot be inferred that they are "safer" for the fetus. Rather, assuming that the current study was both valid and adequately powered to evaluate major perinatal outcomes, we may conclude that either 1) &#x003b2;bs are prescribed for maternal hypertension when there is less threat to the fetus or mother, while non-&#x003b2;b drugs are used in isolation or in combination with &#x003b2;bs when that threat is greater; or 2) &#x003b2;bs are, in fact, less harmful to the fetus compared to other antihypertensive drugs. Thus, these findings, which are hypothesis generating, should be tested by a study capable of demonstrating causation.</p><p>A large international randomized active-control clinical trial is urgently needed to help resolve the controversy surrounding the safety and efficacy for mother and child of treating hypertension during pregnancy. The reasons for such a large double-masked clinical trial are many [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], including the fact that the condition is common; the choices for therapy are few, unlikely to change for several years and inexpensive; and the time to outcome is less than 40 weeks. Women with a BP greater than 160/100 mm Hg without evidence of preeclampsia or impending delivery could be enrolled.</p><p>Randomization could be stratified according to the presence of hypertension before versus after 20 weeks gestation, and treatment might compare a &#x003b2;b to a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or methyldopa, for example. Maternal outcomes should include mode of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], progression to preeclampsia or eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr"
