Fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbance are found to be related to compromised quality of life (QOL), decreased treatment adherence, and increased cancer-related morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In particular, sleep disturbance has been recognized as a persisting problem that is not always addressed effectively in posttreatment care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cancer survivors need better options for alleviating sleep disturbance and improving health-related QOL.</p><p>Sleep disturbance often includes reduced sleep efficiency, prolonged latency to falling asleep, and increased wake time during the night. Recent data indicate that a high percentage (19&#x02013;30&#x000a0;%) of cancer patients report sleep problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Almost 20&#x000a0;% of posttreatment breast cancer patients reported more than 6&#x000a0;months of chronic insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], continuing for several years after diagnosis in a large number of breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, insomnia is a powerful predictor of cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Standard pharmacological treatment options for sleep problems include medications such as benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While these may provide some symptom relief, tolerance may develop, and long-term use can cause fragmented sleep patterns and overreliance on medication to facilitate sleep onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, medication side effects may be troublesome.</p><p>Basic and clinical science evidence supports the premise that mind&#x02013;body interventions can enhance patients&#x02019; healing and recovery, and increase well-being and autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. What we term mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are mind&#x02013;body interventions that focus on the power of mental training in regulating health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. MBIs utilize mental training to facilitate awareness, attention, intention, and attitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our view, MBIs comprise interventions such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and a recent addition, Mind&#x02013;Body Bridging (MBB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These MBIs may help treat and manage conditions such as cancer, chronic pain, sleep disturbance, and depression (see Shapiro and Carlson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for an overview).</p><p>Several recent studies investigated the efficacy and utility of MBSR in managing persisting symptoms in cancer patients and posttreatment survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The findings from these studies are positive and promising, suggesting that MBSR is effective for managing persisting symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients. More recently, a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] of MBSR and MBI for cancer patients and survivors have appeared, further documenting that MBSR in particular and MBI in general are effective in controlling symptoms and improving QOL in cancer patients and survivors.</p><p>Nonetheless, MBSR&#x02019;s efficacy in specifically improving sleep remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In a systematic review of clinical studies of MBSR targeting sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], seven studies were identified. The review reported that the lack of standardized outcome measures precludes pooling of results for quantitative data analysis and that sleep report measures varied (standardized scales, single item, and sleep diaries). Four studies (all uncontrolled) found that MBSR significantly improved measures of sleep quality or duration, while three studies found no statistically significant difference between treatment and control conditions.</p><p>Another recent randomized controlled trial study directly compared MBSR against a standard pharmacotherapy treatment for chronic primary insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The authors reported that MBSR improved sleep onset latency measured by actigraphy (8.9&#x000a0;min) as well as large significant improvements measured by various self-report sleep measures. Britton and her colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] examined whether mindfulness meditation (MM) was associated with changes in objectively measured polysomnographic (PSG) sleep profiles and whether changes in PSG sleep were related to subjectively reported changes in sleep and depression. They found that according to PSG sleep data, mindfulness meditation practice was associated with several indices of increased cortical arousal, including more awakenings and stage 1 sleep and less slow-wave sleep relative to wait-list controls, in proportion to amount of meditation practice. This study underscores potential complex relationships between meditation practice and objective/subjective sleep measures.</p><p>We recently evaluated MBB, in a prospective randomized controlled trial with veterans who suffered from clinically significant self-reported sleep disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The results from our study supported the efficacy of brief sleep-focused MBB in improving not only sleep disturbance but also self-reported comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in veterans. Clinicians working at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System have used MBB in their clinical practice dealing with a variety of mental health conditions and reported anecdotally that MBB seemed effective for managing conditions ranging from PTSD, depression, substance abuse to sleep disturbance, as well as for improving health-related quality of life in patients with wide ranging conditions.</p><p>In light of this preliminary evidence reported above, we reasoned that MBB might be useful in managing sleep and other comorbid symptoms in cancer survivors. We also wanted to examine the efficacy of MBB together with another MBI such as Mindfulness Meditation (MM), which is perhaps one of the most critical components of MBSR and other MBIs (see Chiesa and Serretti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] for reviews of mindfulness meditation and its benefits). As an active control condition, we included Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE).</p><p>Thus, our exploratory study with cancer survivors employed a three-armed randomized controlled parallel group study design. MBB and MM have both similarities and differences. Both MM and MBB highlight awareness practices as core skills in the programs. However, MM obviously includes meditation practice, while MBB does not. MBB is focused on developing experiential bridging skills and utilizing Mind&#x02013;Body Mapping (an exercise designed to make explicit people&#x02019;s often implicit &#x0201c;requirements&#x0201d; of situations; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] for more details), while MM does not explicitly include such an exercise for identifying requirements. Given these shared features and key differences, comparison of the two interventions may offer useful pilot data for clarifying the nature of potential therapeutic benefits from these two programs. On the basis of clinicians&#x02019; anecdotal reports supporting potential usefulness of MBB for wide-ranging conditions, we also wanted to investigate the potential impacts of these sleep-focused MBIs on common comorbid symptoms and psychosocial indicators. Thus, our study included several secondary outcome measures, as a means of more fully understanding the new intervention programs&#x02019; potential impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that MBB and MM would improve self-reported sleep problems and reduce other behavioral or psychological symptoms persisting into the postcancer treatment period. More specifically, we hypothesized that MBB and MM would be more effective than SHE in managing sleep problems in cancer survivors. The study targeted cancer survivors without requiring specific types of cancer for at least two reasons. First, health-related QOL compromised by sleep disturbance and other behavioral or psychological symptoms may be more or less comparable across subjects with different cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Second, some level of symptom burden in cancer survivorship is highly prevalent across different types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, this study served as an exploratory pilot study for establishing the broad efficacy of MBB and MM for supportive care of cancer survivors, by exploring potential impacts of these interventions on sleep (the primary endpoint) and several secondary outcome measures (e.g., depression, well-being, and self-compassion).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>We recruited participants from various cancer clinics (Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah), a cancer support center (Cancer Wellness House), and cancer support events (Survivors at the Summit), and through flyers and newspaper advertisements. Participants were male and female, 18&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years old. We conducted the study from July 2009 through April 2010 at Cancer Wellness House, a nonprofit organization offering support for those living with cancer, surviving cancer, and their family members. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah approved the study protocol.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Since this was an exploratory study, we included survivors of any type of cancer. Cancer survivor was defined as any patient who had completed active cancer treatment. To qualify, participants must have completed active cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy) <italic>at least 3&#x000a0;months prior to attending the first study session</italic>. However, they could be on adjuvant hormone therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen, Lupron, or aromatase inhibitors), sleep medication, or other medications (exceptions listed in exclusion criteria, below). Participants exhibited <italic>self-reported sleep disturbance</italic>, assessed by a validated sleep questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; to be eligible to participate in the study, participants needed to score at least 35 on the MOS-SS Sleep Problems Index II subscale (SPI-II). Scores of 35 and above suggest a high probability of a clinically significant sleep disturbance. No specialized or medical diagnosis of insomnia was undertaken or required. Any type of sleep disturbance or problem was included. Participants spoke and understood English.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The following criteria resulted in exclusion from the study: (1) any underlying severe or untreated psychopathology or psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia); (2) cognitive impairment; (3) neurologic disorder; (4) dementia; (5) taking antipsychotic medication, immunosuppressants and/or corticosteroids; (6) having a metastatic disease; and (7) previous exposure to MBB or MM or MBSR or MBCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized study investigating the effects of the three short-term interventions on sleep in cancer survivors. All interventions consisted of three 2-h sessions, provided once a week for three consecutive weeks. Using computer-generated numbers, we randomly assigned participants to either one of the two interventions selected for each treatment cycle out of the three intervention programs investigated in the study: the SHE program (active control), MBB, and MM. The number of consented participants available at a specific time point determined the size of the groups in each cycle. Since the interventions were held at the same location, we assigned each participant to one of the interventions when they arrived for their first class. We randomized participants in randomly generated blocks of two interventions per cycle (except for the last cycle), maintaining balance of assignments over the seven cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sleep hygiene education program</title><p>The control intervention was SHE, in which participants received educational classes informing them how to change their habits to improve sleep, and what to do if they had concerns about sleep quality. The program was based on the Huntsman Online Patient Education (HOPE) Guide, &#x0201c;Insomnia: patient symptom information&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hopeguide.org/hope/">http://www.hopeguide.org/hope/</ext-link>). Topics included (but were not limited to): &#x0201c;Why would I have insomnia?&#x0201d; (caused by some medications, stress, anxiety, or depression, pain), &#x0201c;When should I call my doctor?&#x0201d; (worries or concerns about sleeping or have questions about insomnia), &#x0201c;What can I do to get a better night&#x02019;s sleep?&#x0201d; (diet, exercise, supportive care, getting ready to sleep), &#x0201c;What should I avoid to get a better night&#x02019;s sleep?&#x0201d; (tips on behaviors that can negatively influence sleep quality), and &#x0201c;What should I know about medicine for sleep problems?&#x0201d; (side-effects and mechanisms of sleep medications and other medications affecting sleep).</p><p>After the SHE instructor explained each HOPE recommendation, participants had an opportunity to ask questions and discuss their sleep issues. Participants were encouraged to follow the SHE recommendations on a daily basis. SHE classes were presented by a licensed clinical social worker with extensive expertise in cancer supportive care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mindfulness Meditation program</title><p>MM was based on MBSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which is a longer program teaching awareness and mindfulness skills, including basic meditation practice and yoga. MBSR was developed and implemented to treat persistent and elevated levels of stress, sleep disturbance, and other behavioral problems in both healthy subjects and those with clinical illnesses (for a meta-analysis review, see Grossman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). Mindfulness may be defined as paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The goal of MBSR is to provide participants with experiential tools and mindfulness practices that help them become more aware of how the mind (including thoughts, emotions and physical sensations) works and relates to external environments. MBSR programs focusing on sleep symptoms previously have used a 6-week long format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], twice as long as our MM program. It should be noted here that the MM program was not intended to cover all the elements included in the standard MBSR program.</p><p>To create a 3-week MM program for our study, we specifically and selectively focused on various forms of mindfulness meditation (e.g., sitting, walking, and body scan). Our MM course included the following: during mindfulness meditation practices at weekly group meetings, fundamental mindfulness meditation skills (breath awareness, awareness of thoughts and emotions), body scans, walking meditation, and forgiveness meditation were reviewed and taught. Group members initially were asked to introduce themselves and include, if they wished, something about their cancer experience and sleep difficulties. Thereafter, they were asked to talk about their cancer only as related to what issues came up during the practices or processes presented. Attention was given to how this differentiates the MM program from a traditional cancer support group. Time was devoted in sessions 2 and 3 to group discussions concerning the implementation of moment-to-moment awareness in the participants&#x02019; lives, allowing for the opportunity for them to learn from one another about how to integrate mindfulness throughout the day. Discussion of issues concerning sleep was focused on the participants&#x02019; experience related to sleep disturbance, having utilized the processes associated with mindfulness throughout the day.</p><p>Home practice assignments were at each individual&#x02019;s discretion, given that participants were not told in advance that there would be extensive homework assignments (as would be the case in MBSR programs). Participants were free to utilize the MBSR meditation CDs covering body scan and breath meditation, as their schedules allowed, noting that some practice would facilitate a more successful outcome. (The MM program did not involve any focus on yoga practice, and participants were instructed to work with their health care provider/physical therapist prior to any utilization of the MBSR yoga CDs.) Participants were also assigned a writing exercise wherein they were asked to write about a concern that was causing them to feel stressed, with a focus on including emotional content and expressing themselves as fully as possible. Handouts for the course included the CDs for mindfulness meditation, a copy of the book, <italic>Full catastrophe living</italic>, a printout on &#x0201c;The practice of mindfulness&#x0201d; taken from the book, and stress reduction tips. MM was taught by a licensed clinical social worker/oncology social worker who is an experienced MBSR instructor and has years of meditation experience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Mind&#x02013;Body Bridging program</title><p>A summary of MBB appears in a few other publications discussing this novel program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Briefly, MBB is a mind&#x02013;body intervention that may be beneficial for a wide range of mental and physical health problems. MBB teaches awareness skills that help individuals recognize and become aware of a dysfunctional mind&#x02013;body state characterized by heightened self-centeredness, as indicated by ruminative thoughts, involuntary constriction of awareness, body tension, and impaired mental or physical functioning. MBB also teaches mind&#x02013;body &#x0201c;mapping&#x0201d; exercises, which are designed to reveal thought patterns known as &#x0201c;requirements&#x0201d; and to link them to bodily states experienced at the time when &#x0201c;requirements&#x0201d; are identified. Requirements are expectations about how people and the world should be at particular moments (an example of a requirement is &#x0201c;I should cope with my cancer more effectively&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;I should not have any symptoms&#x0201d;). Identification of &#x0201c;requirements&#x0201d; is the key component of the MBB program. However, unlike cognitive behavioral therapy-based programs, MBB does not strive to identify maladaptive thought patterns and does not attempt to change them into more adaptive ones. When requirements are not fulfilled, people may develop ruminative storylines that in turn may lead to dysfunctional mind&#x02013;body states. Using awareness practices and defusing requirements, over time and with practice, MBB practitioners learn to expand their awareness, deal more effectively with daily life&#x02019;s challenges, and foster more balanced, harmonious mind&#x02013;body states. In this way, MBB carries awareness practices one critical step further by addressing the underlying cause of the resistances to clarity, i.e., mental afflictions caused by an individual&#x02019;s fixed idea of who she/he is, known as the &#x0201c;Identity System&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;I-System&#x0201d; in MBB teaching language. When requirements are not satisfied, the I-System gets activated and produces a self-centered mind&#x02013;body state. When this happens, it can impede a person&#x02019;s natural functioning. Increased awareness of the I-System may contribute to MBB&#x02019;s therapeutic usefulness. MBB techniques are easy to learn and benefits may accrue rapidly (see Tollefson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] for more detailed descriptions of a general MBB program). In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], as compared with SHE, MBB significantly reduced sleep disturbance in veterans after two weekly sessions. For the present study, the third session was added to the program used in the previous study in order to be responsive to common issues characteristic of cancer survivors.</p><p>The study MBB training covered: identifying what, from MBB&#x02019;s perspective, may be a critical component in persistent sleep problems; learning to use MBB tools, such as exercises to reduce daytime stress; increasing self-awareness; addressing sleep issues pertinent to cancer survivors; and practicing MBB on a daily basis. The MBB training program was taught by a licensed clinical social worker who is a certified MBB instructor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Adherence to programs</title><p>Participants in all groups were asked to apply the techniques and the information they learned during the study and the 2-month period leading to the follow-up assessment. In the MM group, they were encouraged to listen to CDs and read portions of the two books used in the course. In the MBB group, they were asked to complete mind&#x02013;body map exercises from the textbook used. In the SHE group, they were asked to review periodically what they learned from the SHE program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Potential participants contacting the study team completed a screening questionnaire, which covered sleep patterns, demographics, cancer history (type of cancer and treatment), medical history, and medications/supplements used. If a person passed this screening phase, the study team contacted that person&#x02019;s health care provider (with the participant&#x02019;s signed consent) to verify that their mental health and cancer treatment status did not preclude participation in the study. Participants agreed to participate in the study by signing an informed consent form.</p><p>Participants were assessed for study outcome measures using self-report questionnaires, at prerandomization (baseline), at postintervention, and at 2-month follow-up. They also completed exit surveys at postintervention and follow-up. We invited subjects who did not complete the study to participate in the follow-up assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Primary measures</title><sec id="d30e532"><title>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]</title><p>The MOS-SS is a validated 12-item scale providing an index of sleep problems <italic>over the past week</italic> and incorporating six subscales: (1) sleep disturbance, (2) sleep adequacy, (3) daytime somnolence, (4) snoring, (5) waking up short of breath with a headache, and (6) quantity of sleep. Two additional subscales evaluate composite sleep problems based on the above subscales: Sleep Problems Indexes I and II (SPI-I and SPI-II).

The primary endpoint of the study based on the MOS-SS SPI II was the overall benefit from baseline, i.e., <italic>cumulative changes over the four postrandomization periods</italic> comprising week&#x02009;2 (assessed before the beginning of the second session), week&#x02009;3 (assessed before the beginning of the third session), post, and follow-up.

In line with the usual analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) strategy that is strongly recommended for analyzing clinical trial outcomes by Frison and Pocock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], we emphasize that conditioning on baseline covariates performs statistical matching on the prerandomization scores and ensures that postrandomization treatment arm comparisons are free of baseline differences. A significant <italic>F</italic> test for the treatment arms indicates that it is unlikely that the adjusted population means are exactly equal. While the overall <italic>F</italic> tests are informative, since there are three groups in our exploratory study, they do not provide insight into the magnitudes of treatment effects. Given this, we constructed customized contrasts among the treatment vs. control arms (i.e., MBB vs. SHE and MM vs. SHE) using the overall postrandomization averages (comprising week&#x02009;2, week&#x02009;3, post, and follow-up), adjusted for baseline, to estimate the cumulative benefit of the three intervention programs individually and relative to one another.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1035"><title>Other outcomes measures</title><p>All other primary and secondary self-report questionnaires were assessed at three time points: pre, post, and follow-up. In all these analyses, we employed a mixed effects model ANCOVA with prerandomization (baseline) score as a covariate and with treatment arm and postintervention assessment time as categorical factors. As noted above, in line with the usual ANCOVA strategy, conditioning on baseline covariates performs statistical matching on the prerandomization scores and ensures that postrandomization treatment arm comparisons are free of baseline differences. For each self-report outcome measure, the analysis estimated overall treatment arm benefit conditional on assessment time. Just as in the primary outcome measure, to gain insight into the magnitudes of treatment effects, we further constructed customized contrasts among the treatment vs. control arms (i.e., MBB vs. SHE and MM vs. SHE) using the overall postintervention averages (post and follow-up) adjusted for baseline, to estimate the cumulative benefit of the three intervention programs individually and relative to one another.</p><p>The mixed effects analysis model generalizes conventional baseline-adjusted ANCOVA by more flexibly and accurately incorporating the statistical dependence arising with repeated observation of the same individuals. We used an objective criterion, the minimal value of the Bayesian Information Criterion, to determine the most parsimonious fit to alternative covariance structures of the repeated observations, retaining in all cases the full treatment arm-by-period factorial for the fixed effects. Mixed effects analyses invoke an &#x0201c;intent-to-treat&#x0201d; treatment of missing data by including every observation of the dependent measure. No observations are discarded, and no data are imputed. Rather, the algorithm chooses parameter estimates that generate the highest probability for all the data observed under the model assumptions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Attendance</title><p>Following the CONSORT recommendations, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the number of individuals screened, qualified, and enrolled in the study, as well as retention numbers at post and follow-up, for each intervention.

As hypothesized, MBB and MM performed better than SHE in decreasing self-reported sleep disturbance. Although both MBB and MM helped cancer survivors improve sleep, benefits seemed to emerge at different times. While MBB provided more benefit at program completion (at post), at 2-month follow-up, MM was found be equally as effective as MBB. This may be due to differential learning curves required for the two techniques. Data from the present study suggest that both MBB and MM can serve as effective interventions for sleep management in posttreatment cancer survivors.</p><p>In addition, MBB was found to have further benefits in comparison with the active control (SHE): (1) it decreased self-reported symptoms of depression, and (2) it increased overall levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. These changes came about even though MBB was not specifically designed to explicitly address issues concerning these domains. The fact that MBB was effective in attenuating depressive symptoms was consistent with the similar pattern observed in our earlier study of MBB, although in the earlier study it did not reach statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. MM did not produce any reliable change in these secondary outcomes. These results provide preliminary support for the intriguing possibility that sleep-focused MBB can help cancer survivors not only with sleep disturbance but also with other comorbid symptoms such as depression.</p><p>In contrast, there were no reliable improvements in FACT-G, PSS, IES, and PANAS with either MBB or MM. As noted above, both MBB and MM produced improvements in FACT-G that are comparable to the magnitude of clinically meaningful changes reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and this suggests that the mean improvements observed in the MBB and MM groups are in fact clinically meaningful by conventional standards. Similarly, the magnitudes of changes measured by IES and PSS in the MBB and MM groups are comparable to those reported in two recent studies of MBSR for cancer patients or survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Furthermore, it may be the case that these indicators (e.g., IES, PSS, PANAS) are more resistant to short-term changes.</p><p>Our interventions were designed to exclusively deal with cancer survivors&#x02019; problems concerning sleep. Given the possibility that improved sleep can influence other coexisting health conditions, we hypothesized that such sleep-focused interventions might also improve comorbid symptoms. Our objective was to explore the potential value of MBB and MM in improving self-reported sleep and comorbid symptoms in a cross-section of posttreatment cancer survivors, regardless of the type of sleep problems experienced or the origins of their sleep problems. Overall, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that MBB and MM can improve self-reported sleep quality in cancer survivors. However, we cannot yet claim that MBB or MM effectively treated specific sleep disorder conditions (such as insomnia) as assessed by clinical evaluation. Further research would need to explore potential benefits for specific sleep disorders such as primary, secondary, or comorbid insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or sleep-disordered breathing.</p><p>The present study provided strong support for the idea that three weekly sessions of MBB or MM can yield meaningful sleep improvement. Our data are consistent with previous research using other interventions to improve sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy also has been shown to be effective over a short-term period (1&#x02013;4 sessions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. However, MBSR-type interventions may require longer durations (i.e., 6 sessions or longer) to exert their effects (for more on this issue see Carmody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]), given that meditation practice might require a longer time span in order for it to generate sustained benefits.</p><p>The effectiveness of mindfulness practices in facilitating health and well-being, including sleep, has been reported in numerous studies utilizing several interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. We postulated that increased mindfulness might have contributed to improvements in sleep and reductions in self-reported symptoms such as depression. Changes in mindfulness in the MBB group of this study are notable, especially given (1) the brief nature of the intervention (three sessions, once per week) and (2) the fact that, unlike other mindfulness-based interventions, MBB does not include formal meditation practice. However, MBB included everyday awareness practices, which are analogous to informal practice of mindfulness. This suggests the possibility that cancer survivors in the MBB group were able to engage in awareness practices without necessarily first going through formal mindfulness practices, in the form of sitting and walking meditation. The overall level of mindfulness increased in the MM group, but it was not statistically different from that in the control SHE group, despite the fact that MM improved sleep considerably.</p><p>Our exploratory study included participants in remission from a range of cancer types. Since this study assessed efficacy of MBB and MM as novel sleep management interventions, we did not exclude any specific sleep problems. Although it would be desirable to conduct an additional analysis using cancer type or specific sleep disorder as a covariate, the smaller sample size in the present study made it unfeasible to carry out this. Future studies with a bigger sample should investigate this issue. Nonetheless, given positive improvements from the two mind&#x02013;body intervention groups, these inclusive selection criteria may actually contribute to the enhanced generalizability of our findings to the larger cancer survivor population. These results have important implications for selectively targeting sleep in cancer survivors, with potential additional benefits for comorbid symptoms such as depression.</p><p>In this study, MM did not produce beneficial changes in other indicators of psychosocial functioning. This may relate to the question of what &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of a mind&#x02013;body intervention is required to produce observable benefits. MBSR has usually been implemented as an 8-week program since its inception; more recently, sleep-focused MBSR has been implemented as a 6-week program. In our study, MM was given in just three sessions over 3&#x000a0;weeks in accordance with the duration of the MBB program. This may have limited the efficacy of MM, and it would be reasonable to suspect that more sessions given over a longer time period might have made MM more effective in increasing MM&#x02019;s impact on these other psychosocial indicators.</p><p>The present exploratory study produced some encouraging findings, but we are keenly aware of limitations that should be addressed in future clinical trials of MBB and MM. Limitations of our study include the following: the investigative method used to verify the mental health and remission status of study participants; no clinical (i.e., medical) evaluation of study participants with respect to the nature of sleep disturbances and other comorbid conditions (cancer survivors participating in the study, however, had been seeing their health care providers for any posttreatment problems); exclusive reliance on self-report measures; no explicit assessment of intervention fidelity; the lack of an explicit measure of home practice in the MM and MBB groups; and no measures of daily changes in sleep patterns based on sleep diary data.</p><p>Recently, Garland and her colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] proposed a randomized controlled noninferiority trial in which MBSR will be compared with Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I, a known efficacious treatment). This design can efficiently compare these two treatments directly and determine whether MBSR performs to the same standard as CBT-I for the treatment of insomnia with additional benefits of reducing cancer-related comorbid symptoms. Employing this type of study design may prove to be useful in further investigating MBB together with other proven treatments such as CBT-I.</p><p>The present exploratory study suggest that MBB and MM can serve as effective mind&#x02013;body interventions for posttreatment care of cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance. Furthermore, because MBB in particular is easy to learn and cumulative benefits are obtained within only a few sessions, MBB may be an ideal vehicle for managing multiple coexisting symptoms in cancer survivors. However, more research is clearly needed to determine if MBB may specifically serve as a front-loaded program for addressing sleep problems and comorbid psychological conditions like depression in posttreatment cancer survivors. Additionally, future studies might investigate the degree to which mind&#x02013;body interventions may enable cancer survivors to reduce use of sleep medication. MBB in particular, and MBIs in general, can empower cancer survivors to manage complex symptoms, enhance quality of life, and regain more optimal functioning.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00935376">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00935376</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00935376</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The study reported was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Award R21 AT002209 to the first author from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).
