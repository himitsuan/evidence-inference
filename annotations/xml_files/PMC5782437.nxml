While fractional CO<sub>2</sub> lasers (FCLs) are an established treatment option, the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of acne scars is not established though it is being used extensively in other fields of medicine owing to its healing properties.

Shah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] carried out a split-face study on 30 patients with FCL on both sides and intradermal saline on one side and intradermal PRP on the other side on the fifth day after the laser session.

Zhu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used erbium fractional laser with topical PRP in 22 patients with acne scar and reported excellent clinical improvement and patient satisfaction on the PRP-treated patients.

But the difference between right side (FCL-only) and left side (FCL + PRP) was not statistically significant at the end of our study(<italic>P</italic> = 0.2891), which is in contrast to the aforementioned studies. Addition of PRP did not result in a superior scar modification at the end of 4 months, which was similar to the findings of Faghihi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] They injected PRP intradermally on randomly selected sides of the face immediately after FCL and normal saline on the other side. The possible explanation would be the time taken by the scars after the procedure to modify is long and is probably partially modified at 4 months. The questionnaire-based observer assessment of scars (vascularity, pigmentation, and thickness) showed a statistically significant improvement in the before and after scores (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). This indicates there is definite change in the visual quality of scars after the treatment.</p><p>The overall visual analog score of disease severity and questionnaire-based self-assessment of scars (pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity) also showed statistically significant improvement in the before and after scores.

In our study, we smeared the PRP topically instead of injecting it, hence avoiding the trauma of repeated injections on an already laser-damaged area.</p><p>In conclusion, both FCL and FCL + topical PRP improve the quality of acne scars significantly. Addition of topical PRP did not alter the final scar outcome significantly when compared with FCL. However, the FCL-associated adverse events (i.e. redness, swelling, and pain) improved faster and significantly better on the PRP-treated side.
