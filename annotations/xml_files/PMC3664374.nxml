Patients were randomised to adalimumab (N=91) or placebo (N=94). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving ASAS40 at week 12. Efficacy assessments included BASDAI and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). MRI was performed at baseline and week 12 and scored using the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) index.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significantly more patients in the adalimumab group achieved ASAS40 at week 12 compared with patients in the placebo group (36% vs 15%, p&#x0003c;0.001). Significant clinical improvements based on other ASAS responses, ASDAS and BASDAI were also detected at week 12 with adalimumab treatment, as were improvements in quality of life measures. Inflammation in the spine and sacroiliac joints on MRI significantly decreased after 12&#x02005;weeks of adalimumab treatment. Shorter disease duration, younger age, elevated baseline C-reactive protein or higher SPARCC MRI sacroiliac joint scores were associated with better week 12 responses to adalimumab. The safety profile was consistent with what is known for adalimumab in ankylosing spondylitis and other diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with nr-axSpA, adalimumab treatment resulted in effective control of disease activity, decreased inflammation and improved quality of life compared with placebo. Results from ABILITY-1 suggest that adalimumab has a positive benefit&#x02013;risk profile in active nr-axSpA patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>editors-choice</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axial spondyloarthritis may be split into two categories&#x02014;ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)&#x02014;by the 1984 modified New York criteria which require the presence of sacroiliitis on plain x-rays for the classification of AS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>

criteria noted in the study population were inflammatory back pain, HLA-B27 positivity and a good prior response to NSAIDs. Despite the absence of radiographic sacroiliitis, patients with nr-axSpA had high levels of disease activity as measured by the BASDAI and ASDAS. Furthermore, there were moderate levels of functional impairment and reduction in quality of life despite low baseline BASMI<sub>lin</sub> scores, indicating minimal impairment of spinal mobility. The low mean MASES score at baseline also indicated that there was limited involvement or inflammation of entheses in the overall study population, although 72% (133/185) of patients had MASES&#x0003e;0 at baseline (74%, 70/94 placebo; 69%, 63/91 adalimumab).</p><p>With the exception of HLA-B27 status, there were no striking differences between patients who fulfilled the imaging arm (positive MRI sacroiliitis according to the local radiologist/rheumatologist) and those who fulfilled the clinical arm (HLA-B27 positive/MRI negative) of the ASAS axial SpA criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766TB1">table 1</xref>). However, more patients who fulfilled the clinical arm of the ASAS criteria had a family history of SpA. The SPARCC MRI scores for SI joints were also lower in patients who fulfilled the clinical arm, but the scores for the spine were comparable across groups.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Efficacy</title><p>A significantly greater percentage of nr-axSpA patients treated with adalimumab achieved the primary endpoint of ASAS40 response at week 12 (33/91, 36%) compared with patients treated with placebo (14/94, 15%; p<italic/>&#x0003c;0.001, NRI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2">figure 2</xref>A). Based on subgroup interaction analyses, symptom duration, age and baseline CRP status showed significant interactions with treatment on ASAS40 response (p=0.02, p=0.05 and p=0.03, respectively; NRI). There was a greater treatment effect with adalimumab among patients with symptom duration &#x0003c;5&#x02005;years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2">figure 2</xref>B), those whose age was &#x0003c;40&#x02005;years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2">figure 2</xref>C) and patients who had elevated CRP levels at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2">figure 2</xref>D). HLA-B27 status did not demonstrate a significant treatment interaction with adalimumab (p<italic>&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.42; NRI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2">figure 2</xref>E). Patients achieved similar ASAS40 responses with adalimumab regardless of whether or not they had past or present sacroiliitis on MRI according to the assessment of the local radiologist/rheumatologist (p=0.65; NRI). Sensitivity analyses to further explore the influence of MRI inflammation in the SI joints were conducted using centrally-read SPARCC scores. Stratifying patients using the operational classification of positive or negative SI joint MRI inflammation based on SPARCC scores &#x02265;2 or &#x0003c;2 at baseline showed a numerically greater treatment effect of adalimumab in patients with SI joint scores &#x02265;2, but the interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.31; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2">figure 2</xref>F). However, a significant interaction with treatment was observed based on logistic regression between continuous SPARCC SI joint scores at baseline and ASAS40 response at week 12 (p=0.046, NRI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093//annrheumdis-2012-201766/-/DC1">supplementary online Figure S1</ext-link>). Finally, patients with either a positive MRI (SPARCC score &#x02265;2 for either the SI joints or spine) or an elevated CRP at baseline demonstrated a greater response to adalimumab compared with placebo (41% (28/69) adalimumab vs 14% (10/73) placebo), in contrast to patients who had negative MRI of the SI joints and spine and a normal CRP at baseline (23% (5/22) adalimumab vs 20% (4/20) placebo), although the interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.13, NRI). Sex, race, weight, concomitant NSAID or DMARD use and history of inflammatory bowel disease or uveitis did not significantly affect the response to adalimumab treatment.</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Percentage of patients achieving Assessment of Spondyloarthritis international Society 40 response at week 12.

In particular, there were significant decreases in each of the individual components of the ASAS40 response criteria except for BASFI. Although there was a numerically greater improvement in BASFI with adalimumab than with placebo, the difference was not statistically significant. Based on the BASFI component of the ASAS partial remission criteria, 33% of patients (25/75) had BASFI &#x0003c;2 at week 12 in the adalimumab group compared with 11% (9/79) in the placebo group (p=0.001) among patients with BASFI &#x02265;2 at baseline.

Three serious AEs were reported in the adalimumab group: breast dysplasia, induced abortion and acute hepatitis. The acute hepatitis was reported by the investigator as probably due to isoniazid for tuberculosis prophylaxis as the baseline visit laboratory tests prior to the first dose of study drug but after starting isoniazid showed elevated liver function tests. The case of acute hepatitis was one of four hepatic-related AEs in the adalimumab group; all other hepatic-related AEs were isolated liver function test abnormalities that were not associated with a definite diagnosis or liver pathology. There were no malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, lupus-like syndrome, demyelinating disease or deaths through week 12.</p><table-wrap id="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201766TB3" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Number and percentage of patients with adverse events (AEs) during the 12-week double-blind period</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo (N=97) n (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adalimumab (N=95) n (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any AE</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 (58.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 (57.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serious AE</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (1.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (3.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AE leading to discontinuation &#x02003;of study drug</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (1.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (2.1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infectious AE</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28 (28.9)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28 (29.5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serious infection</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Malignancy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatic-related AE</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (4.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (4.2)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first clinical trial to incorporate the ASAS axial SpA criteria in classifying nr-axSpA patients and the largest randomised controlled trial of an anti-TNF therapy in this population. Results from this study provide important insights into the characteristics of patients with nr-axSpA and the potential benefits of adalimumab therapy. First, the level of disease activity of nr-axSpA patients enrolled in this study was similar to those of AS patients who participated in randomised controlled trials of anti-TNF therapies. Second, significant clinical improvement was observed in nr-axSpA patients treated with adalimumab compared with placebo after just 12&#x02005;weeks of therapy. Third, consistent with previous reports, the clinical response to adalimumab treatment in nr-axSpA patients was greater in patients with shorter symptom duration, younger age or presence of elevated CRP at baseline.</p><p>The nr-axSpA population enrolled in this study was younger and had a greater proportion of women compared with AS populations in randomised controlled trials of anti-TNF therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> However, these observations are consistent with what has been reported for other nr-axSpA cohorts, including the patient population that was evaluated to validate the ASAS axial SpA criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> There was an average delay of 7&#x02005;years between onset of symptoms to diagnosis in nr-axSpA patients in this study, which highlights the need for better ways to identify these patients. Despite the absence of radiographic sacroiliitis and the above differences in demographics compared with AS patients, patients with nr-axSpA who continued to have symptoms of active disease despite NSAIDs had comparable levels of disease activity to that of patients with AS according to BASDAI, ASDAS and total back pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> However, a smaller proportion of patients with nr-axSpA had elevated CRP at baseline compared with AS patients, and mean MRI SPARCC scores for the SI joints and spine at baseline were lower than previous reports in patients with AS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>

ASAS40 is a more stringent measure of response than ASAS20 typically used in AS trials. Treatment effect with adalimumab was also significant when other composite measures were used (ie, ASAS20, ASAS 5/6, BASDAI50, ASDAS). More importantly, clinical remission was achieved by more patients in the adalimumab arm than in the placebo arm, whether defined by ASAS PR or ASDAS ID. The clinical efficacy of adalimumab was further supported by significant improvements in objective measures of inflammation (ie, CRP and the SPARCC MRI scores for both SI joints and spine). Although improvements in functionality and quality of life were noted based on the SF36 physical component summary score and HAQ-S, improvement in BASFI and BASMI<sub>lin</sub> did not meet statistical significance. This could be attributed in part to the relatively low baseline BASFI and BASMI<sub>lin</sub> scores. These results confirm previous findings from smaller trials of anti-TNF agents in nr-axSpA. In a randomised controlled trial of 46 patients with nr-axSpA, adalimumab therapy resulted in significantly better ASAS40 responses at week 12 compared with placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Likewise, in 40 patients with inflammatory back pain for 3&#x02005;months to 3&#x02005;years, HLA-B27 positivity and MRI evidence of sacroiliitis, patients receiving infliximab had significantly greater reduction in BASDAI and MRI scores than those on placebo at week 16.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>Subgroup analyses of the interaction between certain baseline characteristics and treatment showed that patients whose symptom duration was &#x0003c;5&#x02005;years, age &#x0003c;40 or baseline CRP was elevated were more likely to achieve ASAS40 at week 12 with adalimumab. Similar observations have been reported in established AS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31 R32 R33">31&#x02013;33</xref> and were noted in a randomised controlled trial of adalimumab in 46 patients with active axial SpA without radiographically-defined sacroiliitis: patients with disease duration &#x02264;3&#x02005;years, age &#x02264;30 or CRP&#x0003e;6&#x02005;mg/l at baseline had a greater probability of achieving ASAS40 or BASDAI50 at week 52.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> These findings further emphasise the need to diagnose patients earlier. No other baseline variables evaluated had an impact on treatment response, including HLA-B27 status and past or present sacroiliitis on MRI according to the ASAS criteria, suggesting that adalimumab is a potential treatment option for nr-axSpA patients regardless of whether they fulfil the imaging or clinical arm of the ASAS axial SpA criteria. However, patients with active inflammation of the SI joints based on a SPARCC score &#x02265;2 at baseline showed a numerically (although non-significant) higher response, and increasing baseline SPARCC SI joint scores were associated with a greater likelihood of clinical response. These findings suggest that the greater the extent of SI joint inflammation, the more likely a patient may benefit from adalimumab treatment. There was also a trend indicating better responses in patients with either inflammation of the SI joints or spine or an elevated CRP at baseline. Thus, objective evidence of active inflammation at baseline, such as presence of a positive MRI or an elevated CRP level, seems to be a good predictor of treatment response to adalimumab.</p><p>Adalimumab was well tolerated during the double-blind period of this study. There were no notable imbalances in the occurrence of AEs between treatment groups. Safety data are consistent with what is known about the safety profile of adalimumab in AS and other immune-mediated diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></p><p>Limitations of this study include the duration of the double-blind period, which does not allow for longer term comparison of the efficacy of adalimumab therapy with placebo in nr-axSpA patients who continue to have active disease despite NSAIDs. This study was not designed to evaluate if adalimumab therapy can prevent progression from nr-axSpA to AS. The trial was also not powered for subgroup analyses, which were further limited by uneven distribution of patients in certain subgroups (eg, HLA-B27 status). In addition, the outcome measures used in this study were validated for AS and have not been specifically developed and validated for a nr-axSpA population. As patients with nr-axSpA and those with AS are part of the same disease spectrum of axial SpA and have similar disease manifestations, the use of previously developed outcome measures for AS in this study of nr-axSpA patients was deemed to be appropriate.</p><p>In summary, 12&#x02005;weeks of adalimumab therapy in patients with nr-axSpA resulted in significant clinical improvements compared with placebo, providing additional evidence that adalimumab controls inflammation with a similar safety profile across a range of spondyloarthritides. Efficacy and safety results from this study suggest that adalimumab is an appropriate treatment option for active nr-axSpA patients who fail NSAIDs, especially those with objective evidence of inflammation. Longer term data would provide information on the optimal use of adalimumab in patients with nr-axSpA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-201766-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1369" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Suchitrita Sarkar of Abbott provided support for statistical analyses and Elaine M Smith of Abbott assisted with drafting and revising the manuscript with direction from the authors.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JS was the principal investigator for the study.
