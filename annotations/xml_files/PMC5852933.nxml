Although there is an improvement in handling and bonding characteristics of the newer dental materials,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the collagen structure and stability of the dentin bond strength are still a challenge. Studies have proved that collagen in the hybrid layer is affected by enzymatic degradation, leading to bond failure over time.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Collagen fibrils in tissue are stabilized by lysyl oxidase-mediated covalent intermolecular cross-linking.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The biomechanical properties of type I collagen can be improved by introducing more cross-links within and/or between the fibrils with the treatment of specific chemical agents.</p><p>Grape seed extract, which is a naturally occurring cross-linker, mainly composed of proanthocyanidins (PAs), could be a good candidate to fulfill such role. It is a natural plant metabolite and showed to possess low toxicity and ability to induce exogenous cross-links.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] PA-based compounds can improve dentin collagen physical properties.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Another such important agent is ascorbic acid. It is an essentially required component in the synthesis of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine in collagen. Hydroxyproline serves to stabilize the collagen triple helix. Hydroxylysine is necessary for the formation of the intermolecular crosslinks in collagen. It is believed that ascorbate modulates collagen production through its effect on prolyl hydroxylation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Hence, we can employ it as an effective chairside procedure to overcome the disadvantage of reduced bond strength of composite resin to dentin.</p><p>The present study was carried out to evaluate if collagen cross-linking agents such as PA and sodium ascorbate can affect the shear bond strength of composite resin bonded to the dentinal surfaces of the teeth.</p><p>The null hypothesis was that &#x0201c;there was no difference in shear bond strength of resin composite with dentin with or without treated with collagen cross-linking agent PA and sodium ascorbate.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>One hundred freshly extracted human permanent molars were used in this study with the following exclusion/inclusion criteria.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

The plastic tube was then removed, and excess composite resin was removed using a polishing disc (Sof-Lex&#x02122;; 3M Espe, St. Paul, MN, USA).

The increase in bond strength in the present study may be attributed to improve dentin collagen stability, due to the higher number of collagen cross-links.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are such class of enzymes that are known to degrade collagen. These proteins are found in the dentin but more abundant on enamel&#x02013;dentin junction and in the predentin.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The MMPs converted from Pro-MMP which are trapped or bound in the dentin during its formation by lowering the pH to 4.5 or below.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Application of self-etching adhesives (acidic resins) to dentin increases 14-fold in MMP enzyme activity.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Thus, adjunctive collagen pretreatment strategies have been proposed to improve dentin adhesion, through the use of agents that maintain the stability of collagen toward enzymatic degradation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] These agents include the use of substances that are considered to be inhibitors of MMPs and cysteine cathepsins. Thus, pretreatment with collagen cross-linking agents can promise improvement in the bonding mechanism preserving the integrity of collagen hybrid layer.</p><p>Various natural as well as synthetic cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde, tannic acid, PA, genipin, and cocoa seed extract have been used to strengthen the hybrid layer and have shown positive results in improving the bond strength to significant levels.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Results of this study show that sodium ascorbate application significantly improves bond strength compared with control and PA application [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>In Group IIa (10% sodium ascorbate for 5 min), shear bond strength ranged from 16.31 to 23.07 MPa, with a mean value of 20.09 Mpa and a SD of 1.87 MPa.</p><p>In Group IIb (10% sodium ascorbate for 10 min), shear bond strength ranged from 18.74 to 29.99 MPa, with a mean value of 22.55 MPa and a SD of 2.51 MPa.</p><p>These results for the sodium ascorbate in the present study were found to be time dependent (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas for PA difference was found to be insignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.096) [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><p>The major action of the sodium ascorbate is in the stabilization of the collagen, as a cofactor of hydroxylation of proline and lysine.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A study based on energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis has shown that calcium ion concentration after demineralization dropped from the 28.62 to 12.77% and increased to 15.99% after sodium ascorbate treatment for 10 min, With this may due to chemical interaction of sodium ascorbate with collagen fibres in dentine.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, shear bond strength of composite to deep dentin after treatment with 6.5% PA and 10% sodium ascorbate found the statistically significant better results with PA than the sodium ascorbate.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>PAs, which form a complex subgroup of the flavonoid compounds, have been found in a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, flowers, nuts, seeds, and bark.
