This study evaluated the effectiveness of leadership training programs on self-esteem and self-efficacy among adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>a total of 180 students of the same grade of one secondary school were randomized into an intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) and a control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;130). The students in the intervention group participated in a 6-month program of leadership training and service learning, while the control group did not participate in any training. Their self-esteem and self-efficacy were assessed by Rosenberg Self-Esteem questionnaire and Chinese Adaptation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale, respectively, before and after the program. Both scales have been recognized internationally as valid and reliable survey instruments to measure these psychological attributes. The scores were compared by Student&#x02019;s tests according to gender. A total of 180 students were enrolled during the study period October, 2009 to May, 2010. Their mean age was 15.18 years (0.62) and 56.7% were male. Students allocated to the intervention and control group had statistically similar demographic characteristics except gender (male 36.0% vs. 64.6%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001). Overall, the self-esteem scores increased by 1.28 and decreased by 0.30 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.161) while the self-efficacy scores increased by 0.26 and decreased by 0.76 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.429) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Among female students, the intervention group showed significant improvements in both self-esteem (2.38 vs. &#x02212;0.24, p&#x0003c;0.001) and self-efficacy (1.32 vs. &#x02013;0.04, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.043).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Leadership training program were not found to be effective to enhance self-esteem and self-efficacy in adolescents, except girls who showed modest increase in these outcomes.

Both the students and their formal guardians participated in this project were informed, with their verbal consent obtained. The surveys were anonymous and only aggregate data were presented. Individual data or personal particulars were kept confidential by researchers. The school principal endorsed this project regarding its operation and planning, agreed the participation of students and parents in this project, as well as data collection using surveys. The ethics committee has waived the requirement of using consent forms as school consent had been sought and none of the survey items contained any sensitive issues. The principal researcher has also kept a file which documented the list of students who have given verbal consent. <bold>During the consent process, all students were thoroughly offered a full description of the program including its duration, interventional components and commitments required.

</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and Study Design</title><p>One mainstream secondary school in an underprivileged district of Hong Kong was purposively invited to participate in this study. The district has a median monthly household income of US$2,055, compared with the Hong Kong wide figure of US$2,240 <xref rid="pone.0052023-Population1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We included all students in secondary grade 4 of this school (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;180) during the study period October, 2009 to May, 2010. We adopted the design of a randomized controlled trial. We randomly allocated all students into an intervention group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) and a control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;130) from computer-generated random numbers with a student regarded as one unit of randomization. The allocation ratio was not 1&#x02236;1 since the maximum quota for each programme could accommodate 50 students only. Students in the intervention group received a leadership training programme, including organizing volunteer services and school-based moral and civic activities. All students were enrolled by the class teachers. There were no changes to the methods and trial outcomes after trial commencement. Not having previous data on the estimated changes in the scores, we considered an increase of 2.5 points in self-esteem or self-efficacy being significant. Assume a standard deviation of 4.0 in both the control and intervention groups, and we set the test as two-tailed, alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 and beta&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20, the minimum sample size was 40 in each group. We determined to recruit 50 subjects in the intervention group to account for a possible attrition rate of up to 20%. We did not implement any programme for students in the control group. All students who were mentally competent to join the programme were included, as independently assessed by their respective class teachers who were familiar with the mental competence of their students. We regarded that this programme would confer benefits to adolescents at their developing stage, irrespective of their baseline self-esteem and self-efficacy levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>The leadership training programme aims to improve the capability of the students to learn more effectively, develop creativity, willpower, emotional intelligence, social communication skills and critical thinking. The project was named &#x0201c;Hand in Hand Serves the Community&#x0201d;, targeting mainly to adolescents at the age range of 15&#x02013;16 years. A series of leadership training activities, volunteer services and school-based moral educational programs were organized to promote students&#x02019; self-image and confidence. This practice-based programme was designed by educational expert with extensive experience in adolescent training, while qualified trainers on leadership skills were invited as the programme coaches and coordinators. Its activity components have been designed, further discussed and finalized among teaching professionals to suit the target participants in the age range of 15&#x02013;16 years, taking into account local situations. The theme of this project is <bold><italic>&#x0201c;Stride over yourself &#x00026; Contribute to the society&#x0201d;</italic></bold>
<bold>.</bold> It could provide opportunities for students to experience success, failure, reshape themselves, rebuild their self-confidence and trust with peers, parents and teachers. The rationale of this project was to raise students&#x02019; confidence and build up positive self-image by carrying out leadership training and performing volunteer services, with an ultimate aim to build up their self-esteem and self-efficacy. Students could take this opportunity to show their concern and provide services for the disabled children (e.g. those with neuro-developmental disorder, neurological and degenerative diseases, scoliosis, spinal deformities and cerebral palsy) and single living seniors residing in underprivileged regions. The total contact hours were approximately 20 hours, with 4 hour of activity participation monthly for a 5-month training period. The implementation was the same for all students in the intervention group, and all 50 participant students attended the same class. The activities in the programme were designed to enhance students&#x02019; organizational capability, problem solving skills, team building techniques, fostering of care and concerns towards others, sharing of successful experiences, and build up expertise on activity design among the programme participants.

The differences in the changes of these scores were statistically significant only among female students. We concluded that this school-based leadership training programme was effective to enhance self-esteem and self-efficacy among female adolescent students. Nevertheless, the absolute differences in the score changes were modest (2.62 points in self-esteem and 1.36 points in efficacy).</p><p>Studies in a wide range of western countries have determined that adolescent females, on average, have a lower sense of self-esteem than adolescent males <xref rid="pone.0052023-Baumeister1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052023-Pipher1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

In the present study, female but not male students were found to benefit from the training programmes.

It was concluded that self-esteem increases at a faster rate among girls than boys during high school. Rebelliousness, which exits gender disparity, has also been demonstrated to be an independent factor associated with low self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0052023-McClure1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. <bold>Nevertheless, there exists many cultural and geopolitical factors which might not allow direct comparison between studies conducted in Western countries and the present one.</bold> Future studies should explore why female students showed significant changes in both scores whilst male students had decreased scores in both self-esteem and self-efficacy. It is unknown whether these training programmes were not emotionally conceivable by male students due to the programme design, or a chance finding with a short period of follow-up.</p><p>The explanation why experiential learning could lead to better self-esteem and self-efficacy was well supported by existing literature.

Students have the opportunity to apply their experiences to real-life situations through the reflective process. By providing students opportunities to learn by preparing, leading, and reflecting upon their service experiences, they ultimately create a reciprocal learning experience between them and the community.</p><p>This is a randomized controlled trial and we found that the majority of the participant characteristics were similar between the control and intervention group before subject enrollment. There were no subject drop-outs or any attrition in any sessions of this training programme. These programmes include team-building, service learning and project planning initiatives, and it is anticipated that only the participants in the intervention group could receive direct benefits. However, some of its limitations should be addressed. First, this study captured only short-term outcomes of self-esteem and self-efficacy within a time frame of 6 months, and the sustainability of the positive changes due to the intervention was yet to be evaluated. Although the measures of self-esteem and self-efficacy have relatively satisfactory psychometric properties (reliability ranged from 0.76&#x02013;0.90), <bold>the self-reported nature of the surveys might introduce some forms of ascertainment bias, and there have been few studies evaluating whether the scales used in the present study were sensitive to change over time.</bold> Also, there is a remarkable gender imbalance between the control and intervention group, although there exists no statistical differences in all other demographic variables between the two groups. The randomization allocation used in this study is 130&#x02236;50 due to the maximum quota of 50 students for programme enrollment and this is not as desirable as a 1&#x02236;1 allocation ratio. In addition, these two outcome measures represent only part of the many psychosocial parameters in adolescent development, and we have not measured the other components which could be influenced by the training programme. These include self-concept, school bonding, beliefs about mutual help, positive social behavior and conduct problems <xref rid="pone.0052023-Durlak1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, one might argue that interaction between the intervention and control groups could take place; there is no strategy implemented in this programme to prevent communications between students of different study groups about their experiences throughout the study period. So, controls may very well have been exposed indirectly to the intervention. However, contamination as a potential problem could be minimized by the highly participatory nature and great degree of self-involvement among programme participants, who cannot influence the control group much by directly sharing the programme content to the non-participants. <bold>Finally, there are some potential confounding factors where we have not controlled for, including ethnicity, culture, societal role, experiences of abuse, academic success, self-motivated community participation which might influence the outcome measures, although randomization could theoretically balance these factors between the two groups.</bold>
</p><p>In summary, this study reported no positive changes in self-esteem and self-efficacy among secondary school students, but we found modest positive improvements among female students on secondary analysis. Previous evaluations have found that one-third to one-half of adolescents struggle with low self-esteem, especially in early adolescence <xref rid="pone.0052023-Harter2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052023-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Future studies should assess long-term impacts of these programmes in different age groups, measure more psychosocial dimensions as study outcomes, and evaluate the reasons why the effectiveness of these programme influenced female students to a greater extent.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thanked all the students and teachers who have participated in the learning programme and the survey study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0052023-Rosenberg1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Rosenberg M (1965) Society and the adolescent self-image.
