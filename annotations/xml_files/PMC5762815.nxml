We assessed the effectiveness of adding training in neonatal bag and mask resuscitation and oral antibiotic therapy for suspected neonatal infections to a basic preventive and promotive interventions package delivered by public sector community-based lady health workers (LHWs) in rural Pakistan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in two subdistricts of Naushahro Feroze in rural Sindh, Pakistan, between April 15, 2009, and Dec 10, 2012. LHWs, trained in basic newborn resuscitation and in recognition and treatment (with oral amoxicillin) of suspected neonatal respiratory infections, were linked with traditional birth attendants and encouraged to attend home births. Control clusters received routine care through the existing national programme. The primary outcome was all-cause neonatal mortality. Independent data collection teams recorded data for all pregnancies and their outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and household practices related to maternal and newborn care.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Of the 27 randomised clusters with functional LHW programmes, 13 were allocated to the intervention group (n=242&#x02008;749) and 14 to the control group (n=256&#x02008;985). In the intervention group, LHWs did 80% of the planned community mobilisation sessions, but were able to attend only 1184 (14%) of 8425 deliveries and 4318 (25%) of 17&#x02008;288 neonatal visits within 72 h of birth (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001 for both variables compared with the control group). The neonatal mortality rate was 42 deaths per 1000 livebirths in intervention clusters compared with 55 per 1000 in the control group (risk ratio 0&#x000b7;80, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;68&#x02013;0&#x000b7;93; p=0&#x000b7;005).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The reduction in neonatal mortality in intervention clusters occurred against a background of improvements in domiciliary practices for maternal and newborn care. However, the poor reach of LHWs in accessing newborn infants at birth and in the early postnatal period underscores the limitations of tasking community health workers in public sector programmes working in similar circumstances with such complex interventions. Such community-based interventions in health systems should be accompanied by concerted efforts to improve quality of care in facilities and referral systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Saving Newborn Lives, Save the Children USA.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">Globally, 5&#x000b7;9 million children still die yearly before reaching their fifth birthday.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> 2&#x000b7;7 million of these deaths are accounted for by neonates.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Much of the improvement in child survival over the past few decades has resulted from reductions in post-neonatal deaths from measles, pneumonia, and diarrhoea.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Other than a reduction in deaths due to neonatal tetanus, improvements in neonatal survival in much of south Asia have lagged behind reductions in post-neonatal mortality.</p><p id="para20">About two-thirds of the global burden of maternal deaths, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths is concentrated in ten large countries in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, of which Pakistan is one.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Two groups of conditions account for most neonatal deaths: preterm birth complications (an estimated 1&#x000b7;055 million deaths) and intrapartum-related events, which were formerly known as birth asphyxia (0&#x000b7;691 million deaths).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> A further 0&#x000b7;581 million neonatal deaths annually are due to sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhoea.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Almost half of all stillbirths occur during labour and delivery, and nearly half of all neonatal deaths occur in the hours immediately after birth.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although the proportion of facility-based births is increasing in many countries, a large proportion of deaths occur at home, and combinations of community-based services, outreach services, and high-quality facility-based services are needed to make a difference.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In view of shortages of trained physicians and midwives in many settings, task shifting to a range of ancillary health workers, including community health workers, is a possible option.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p id="para30"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para40"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para50">The role of community-based approaches and community health workers in promotion of care and delivery of health-care messages to improve perinatal and newborn care is well established. We did a systematic review of available information about community-based strategies for improving newborn care with community health workers in Pakistan, and also consulted the global literature. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane library, and regional databases of WHO and UNICEF with the terms &#x0201c;community health workers&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;community platforms&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;newborn&#x0201d;, and linked these medical subject heading terms to &#x0201c;Pakistan&#x0201d; to identify articles published in English on or before March 31, 2017. A Cochrane review included data from 26 cluster-randomised or quasi-randomised trials of a wide range of interventional packages, including two subsets from three trials. The data showed major reductions in neonatal mortality (including both early and late mortality), stillbirths, and perinatal mortality as a result of implementation of community-based interventional care packages. Although we identified strong evidence of improved household behaviours and improved care seeking in facilities, results for home-based neonatal resuscitation by either community health workers or traditional birth attendants were mixed, and results for antibiotic administration by community health workers were limited to a few efficacy trials, none of which were done in large public sector programmes. After completing a feasibility assessment, we worked with the National Program for Family Planning and Primary Care in Pakistan to assess the effect of training lady health workers (LHWs) in rural Pakistan to attend births, provide home-based bag and mask resuscitation as required, and provide oral amoxicillin to neonates with suspected pneumonia or serious infections before referral.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para70">Our cluster-randomised trial showed that community intervention by the LHW programme led to a 20% reduction in neonatal mortality and was associated with significant improvements in household practices and newborn care practices. However, overall effective coverage by functional LHWs was only 48%, and they were able to perform resuscitation in only 4% of potentially eligible neonates with birth asphyxia. The intervention had no effect on cause-specific neonatal mortality due to asphyxia or suspected serious infections. We also identified no effects on care seeking for facility births and stillbirths in the intervention clusters.</p><p id="para80"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para90">Our trial supports the use of community health workers in large programmes for community mobilisation and support strategies for preventive and promotive maternal and newborn care. However, in view of the reality of large-scale public sector programmes, tasking such health workers with complex additional domiciliary care responsibilities might not be advisable. Improvement of maternal and newborn care in facilities and promotion of care seeking and transportation could prove more effective.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para100">In Pakistan, despite some improvements in coverage of antenatal care and skilled attendance, a high proportion of neonatal deaths occur at home, particularly in rural areas, where few trained professionals and skilled birth attendants are available.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Results of a 2012&#x02013;13 survey of demographics and health showed large urban&#x02013;rural disparities in terms of delivery (32% of deliveries in urban areas were home births <italic>vs</italic> 60% in rural areas) and neonatal mortality (47 deaths per 1000 livebirths in urban areas <italic>vs</italic> 62 per 1000 in rural areas).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The Pakistani Government initiated a rural health programme with community health workers&#x02014;so-called lady health workers (LHWs)&#x02014;in 1994, with a focus on preventive and promotive strategies for maternal health, family planning, and primary care.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> More than 100&#x02008;000 LHWs are deployed across rural Pakistan, but coverage is variable (ranging from 40&#x02013;80%),<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and they do not routinely attend home deliveries.

We collected information about knowledge and practices relating to neonatal care from a random sample of newly delivered mothers identified in the baseline survey. We then did a formative qualitative study to develop and adapt the proposed intervention package to the local context and assess acceptability in close consultation with the federal and provincial LHW programmes and health departments.

Rural health centres cater to a population of 25&#x02008;000&#x02013;50&#x02008;000 and have 25&#x02013;50 affiliated LHWs. Most LHWs have a catchment population of about 1000 individuals (120&#x02013;200 households), are mostly resident in the same area, and are not transferred to other facilities or areas. In the original trial proposal, we anticipated the potential inclusion of 34 clusters representing the entire district.</p><p id="para170">Clusters were assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or control groups. To ensure reasonable balance between the two arms, we used stratified, restricted randomisation to allocate clusters. Two strata were defined on the basis of level of health facilities: hospital or rural health centre (nine clusters) or basic health units (18 clusters). 1 million random allocation schemes were generated by the study statistician (SC), who used a computer algorithm. Acceptable schemes were those in which the total populations of each arm was restricted to within 15&#x02008;000 of each other, total livebirths per year per arm to within 1000 of each other, overall neonatal mortality rates to within five per 1000 livebirths of each other, the ratio of LHWs to population to be within one per 10&#x02008;000 population of each other, and overall female literacy rates to be within 5% of each other.

Senior faculty members of the Division of Women and Child Health of Aga Khan University (Karachi, Pakistan) held 5 days' training for LHW programme master trainers, who subsequently trained LHWs from the intervention clusters at the health facilities to which they were affiliated (an initial 3 days of training and monthly 1 day refresher sessions thereafter). Study supervisors along with LHW programme managers monitored the refresher sessions. Each intervention LHW was provided with a bag and mask for neonatal resuscitation (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway) and oral amoxicillin (125 mg/1&#x000b7;25 ml, to be given as 50 mg/kg per dose). LHWs were also given pictorial guides describing the management of asphyxia, thermal care, co-bedding, breastfeeding of low-birthweight babies, and recognition of suspected pneumonia and administration of oral amoxicillin before referral.</p><p id="para190">As already included in the LHW programme guidance, we reinforced the importance of linkages of LHWs with traditional birth attendants in their areas. LHWs were encouraged to maintain close links with traditional birth attendants, keep records of expected births, and attend home deliveries. Clean delivery kits were provided to pregnant women in the intervention clusters during health education sessions delivered by LHWs, and the importance of provision of urgent neonatal care at birth, if needed, was emphasised. LHWs were trained as per national and project guidelines to do additional postnatal visits on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after birth. LHWs were reimbursed additional travel costs, if any, to attend deliveries or postnatal visits, but no additional salary or other financial incentives were provided. A 3-day orientation programme in basic immediate maternal and newborn care was also organised for traditional birth attendants in the intervention arm, who were trained in the use of clean delivery kits, and strongly encouraged to inform LHWs in a timely manner to attend the home birth. No remuneration, commodities, or resuscitation training was provided to traditional birth attendants.</p><p id="para200">Separate training sessions on health education and community mobilisation were held for male community mobilisers&#x02014;volunteers from the villages, who were tasked with monthly mobilisation and review meetings with male elders and members of the community. These meetings aimed to promote antenatal care, postnatal care, and facility births. For people choosing to deliver at home, the importance of informing the LHW so that she could attend the childbirth was also reinforced, and volunteers were identified to escorts LHWs to attend deliveries, especially after dark.</p><p id="para210">In the control clusters, the LHW programme continued to function as usual. LHWs continued to have regular monthly debriefing and refresher trainings according to the standard national LHW programme curriculum in the health facilities to which they were affiliated. However, as in the intervention arm, health-care providers from public sector facilities in the entire district received a one-time refresher training on essential neonatal care and management of sick newborn infants according to WHO guidelines<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> in three separate workshops done between January and May, 2010.</p><p id="para220">LHW programme supervisors monitored the delivery of the intervention package and related components and maintained their own records. An independent surveillance system was implemented, with 13 data collection teams visiting each household in the trial area quarterly. Verbal consent from heads of households and respondents was obtained for data collection. These data collectors were managed and deployed independently of the LHW programme and shuffled periodically as per previous surveillance protocols.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> They gathered standardised information from each household on all pregnancies, their outcomes, new pregnancies, neonatal morbidity and mortality, in-migrations, and out-migrations. Data collectors recorded whether the LHW was present at the time of delivery and instituted any interventions on the baby, and recorded treatments provided and referrals to hospital. Every 6 months, women reporting a livebirth since the previous surveillance visit were interviewed with a structured questionnaire to assess knowledge and practices related to neonatal care and LHW visits or actions.</p><p id="para230">In addition to their official logbooks, LHWs in the intervention clusters were encouraged to record and maintain information about home visits, neonatal illnesses, management of babies with breathing difficulties, low birthweight, and suspected serious infections, referrals, and outcomes on separate forms provided by the research team. The research team monitored the monthly LHWs refresher training meetings and reviewed the forms provided by LHWs. Verbal autopsies of all stillbirths and neonatal deaths were done by a separate team of trained anthropologists within 2&#x02013;16 weeks of the event with standard WHO-recommended instruments.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="para240">The primary outcome of the trial was all-cause neonatal mortality. The initial proposal included perinatal mortality as a primary outcome, but on the basis of feedback from the LHW programme and the range of outcomes captured therein, we principally focused on neonatal mortality instead. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific neonatal mortality due to intrapartum events, prematurity, and sepsis, and the stillbirth rate.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="para250">In the Hala trial,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> an almost 20% reduction in neonatal mortality was reported with LHW training in preventive care and community mobilisation for improved household practices and care seeking compared with the control population, and thereafter the LHW programme adopted the Hala package within its training programme.

We estimated that inclusion of all births for 3 years would provide greater than 90% power to detect a 40% reduction in neonatal mortality rate and close to 80% power to detect a 30% reduction.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="para260">We compared baseline characteristics of intervention and control areas by visual inspection. During the intervention period, frequency of birthing practices, LHW contacts, and neonatal morbidity rates in both groups were compared with logistic regression, with robust SEs to account for between-cluster variation, and adjusted for surveillance round and randomisation stratum. Analysis of mortality outcomes was done with generalised estimating equations, with robust SEs to account for the cluster randomisation. To obtain estimates of the risk ratio for intervention versus control clusters, binomial regression models with a log link were fitted, controlling for cluster-level log(baseline mortality, stillbirths, and early pregnancy loss), randomisation stratum, and surveillance round.

This 20% reduction is similar to the 15% reduction reported in an earlier trial, which did not include additional training of LHWs to resuscitate neonates at home as required or treat suspected pneumonia with antibiotics.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="para370">This overall effect of the combined intervention was much smaller than we hypothesised at trial outset, and was lower than the reductions recorded in other cluster-randomised trials<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> in the region. However, those studies were mostly efficacy trials that directly employed, supervised, and remunerated community health workers, as opposed to true effectiveness studies done within existing public sector health systems with their inherent constraints. In the only effectiveness trial<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> of scale-up of integrated management of neonatal and childhood illnesses, which was done through the public health system in India, a much smaller (9%) reduction in neonatal mortality was reported. The Newhints trial<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> in Ghana, which was based on home visits by existing community-based volunteers, showed increases in the coverage of several essential newborn care behaviours, but did not significantly affect neonatal mortality.</p><p id="para380">Our findings suggest limited additional benefits compared with basic promotive and preventive care of training public sector LHWs in Pakistan to resuscitate newborn infants delivered at home and treat suspected neonatal infections with oral antibiotics. They are also a stark reminder of the limitations to what busy public sector community health workers can deliver. In addition to community health workers' technical limitations, the effectiveness of such additional activities is dependent on the workload and range of other duties that such workers have in health systems. However, we think that the reduction in neonatal mortality shows the importance of community outreach services and the role of task shifting in reducing perinatal and neonatal mortality in such high-risk rural populations.</p><p id="para390">Several key household behaviours related to maternal and newborn care improved in the households of the intervention clusters compared with control clusters, suggesting that community-based health promotion was effective. These findings are consistent with those noted in the previous trial of LHWs in Hala,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and included an important increase in routine LHW visits to mothers in both the antenatal and postnatal periods and evidence of improved practices such as colostrum administration, early initiation of breastfeeding, and dry cord care.</p><p id="para400">Our study design and operational plan had several strengths. First, the enhanced training programme was integrated with the district LHW programme and implemented like other regular trainings in the district health system. Training in newborn care was guided by specific learning objectives and accompanied by assessment of trainee performance and skills, which all LHWs passed. We achieved close engagement of the LHW programme through training and implementation through their trainers, monthly continuous education sessions (generally called monthly refresher trainings) at catchment facilities, and monitoring of intervention delivery by programme supervisors and district health officials. The regular refresher sessions were based on the LHW programme's standard protocols and well documented.</p><p id="para410">Second, we used a detailed, independent data-collection system. We gathered data for outcomes and exposures through a quarterly active surveillance system via independent teams of data collectors. As part of the quality-assurance process, around 5% of the households were revisited by independent monitors within 3 days of the surveillance visits to corroborate findings. Trained programme managers also monitored LHW performance and activities with standard checklists and generated monthly summaries. Despite a few transfers of LHWs and some choosing not to participate, randomisation through the reporting facilities ensured no contamination between intervention and control clusters, although some sharing of messages between families and residents was inevitable.</p><p id="para420">Our trial also had several limitations in view of its scale and the fact that implementation was largely dependent upon LHW functionality and availability. There was a substantial loss of working days and suspension of routine and project-specific mother and child health-care intervention activities as a result of LHWs' deployment in periodic mass polio immunisation campaigns. LHWs were frequently tasked with additional duties for immunisation activities such as measles campaigns and child health days. During the massive seasonal floods of 2010 and 2011,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> LHWs were deployed twice for several months to provide flood relief activities in the district. We estimate that almost 30% of LHW time was spent on such activities during the trial. We do not regard this as improper implementation; rather, we think it reflects the reality of busy public sector programmes and employees, who have to multitask. Attendance of childbirths by LHWs alongside traditional birth attendants, although considered feasible in the initial assessment and actively promoted, was a particular challenge. LHWs attended only a small proportion of home births. Stated barriers to attendance included the need to travel alone, restricted mobility at night, that these activities were additional to their routine activities, and the lack of remuneration by families (unlike traditional birth attendants, who get compensated directly by families).</p><p id="para430">Information obtained by data collectors on household practices was based on maternal recall and not validated through direct observations, and the possibility of some respondent bias and over-reporting of recommended health-care activities cannot be ruled out. Owing to low maternal literacy and social taboos, a large proportion of mothers did not remember or report the exact date of their last menstrual period, and the possibility of differential misclassification of miscarriages and stillbirths cannot be excluded either.</p><p id="para440">Our effectiveness trial included fewer newborn infants in the early neonatal period than did other efficacy trials<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> from the region, but was nonetheless associated with a significant reduction in neonatal mortality. The trial also showed that, notwithstanding several limitations, some LHWs could establish rapports with and work alongside local traditional birth attendants, including attending some births. The reduction in neonatal deaths was associated with an increase in antenatal care visits and the use of clean delivery kits at birth. However, the proportions of births attended by LHWs (14%) and potentially asphyxiated newborns resuscitated by LHWs during those visits (4%) were very small. The same was true for early postnatal home visits by LHWs (25%) and provision of amoxicillin (16%) to overtly sick neonates in the intervention clusters. Although the rates were substantially higher in intervention than in control clusters, overall intervention coverage for these morbidities by LHWs in the intervention clusters remained very low and no differences in cause-specific mortality as assessed by verbal autopsies were identified, although the study was not powered to assess such effects. We therefore cannot ascribe improvements in neonatal outcomes to individual intervention components related to home-based treatment. The choice of oral amoxicillin for treatment of suspected pneumonia based on clinical features including fast breathing was consonant with WHO guidance at the time,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> although this recommendation for early neonatal pneumonia or infection has been challenged,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> and criteria for presumed serious bacterial infections in neonates have become more holistic.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p><p id="para450">A significant difference from previous findings in Sindh<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> was the lack of effect on facility births and stillbirths. Although we trained public sector staff across all facilities in the district at the beginning of the trial, notable differences from Hala were identified in terms of levels of staff motivation, quality of care, and the availability of adequate around-the-clock services in public sector facilities and the district headquarter hospital. This finding is important in view of the general benefits of referral and care seeking noted in community-based interventions for maternal and newborn care.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Previous studies have shown that care for preterm and low-birthweight infants and newborn resuscitation can be delivered in home settings by motivated and well-trained community health workers,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> but outside of skin-to-skin care,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> few have shown effective management of preterm infants in domiciliary settings.</p><p id="para460">We firmly believe that if packages of community-based maternal and newborn care are delivered through community health workers, appropriate measures to strengthen health systems, transport systems, and quality of care therein are also needed. In addition to community mobilisation and support, urgent attention is needed for the provision of adequate basic and emergency newborn care facilities in health facilities, accompanied by strengthening of quality care for preterm infants and infants with presumed serious bacterial infections.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Although the importance of community-based maternal and newborn care is well recognised, the limitations of this delivery platform in reducing neonatal mortality is also well appreciated. Growing evidence supports the provision of high-quality basic and emergency maternal and newborn care in referral facilities. Pakistan and other south Asian countries should prioritise both community-based strategies for promotive and preventive care and high-quality facility-based care as key measures to achieve universal health care and the Sustainable Development Goal 3 targets for maternal and newborn health.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p></sec></body><back><ref-list
