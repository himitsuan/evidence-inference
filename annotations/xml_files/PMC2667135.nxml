The mortality risk is approximately two to three times greater in patients with MRSA bacteraemia than in those with methicillin-susceptible <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MSSA) bacteraemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with SAB/IE are likely to receive intravenous (iv) antimicrobial therapy for up to 4&#x02013;6 weeks. An increasing focus on hospital costs and pressure to free up expensive hospital beds have motivated clinicians to seek alternative therapeutic approaches, including community-based outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (CoPAT). Numerous reports describing the use of CoPAT in a broad cross-section of patient populations support the notion that selected patients with SAB/IE&#x02014;in particular, those who have stabilized in the hospital&#x02014;may be candidates for the completion of therapy in a community setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C10">10</xref></sup> Typical community-based settings involve home treatment as well as treatment at nursing facilities, assisted-living facilities and rehabilitation centres. Although most studies of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) involve registries, or are otherwise retrospective in nature, the available data show that cure rates are generally &#x0003e;90% for bacterial infections of all kinds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C11">11</xref></sup></p><p>While OPAT studies are plentiful, there is a paucity of data from controlled clinical trials. The recently completed prospective, randomized trial comparing daptomycin with standard therapy for SAB/IE captured detailed data on patients treated both inside and outside the hospital setting. In this study, standard therapy, against which daptomycin treatment was compared, consisted of a semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, each with 4 days of initial low-dose gentamicin [1 mg/kg every 8 h, adjusted as appropriate for creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>)].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C12">12</xref></sup></p><p>The unique database generated during the course of the randomized trial provides an opportunity to assess the impact of treatment setting on patients being treated for a serious infection. Therefore, we conducted a further analysis of the data to examine the clinical course of patients who completed their antibiotic therapy in the hospital compared with those who received some portion in the CoPAT setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Using data from the open-label, randomized, controlled trial of daptomycin versus standard therapy (semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, each with initial low-dose gentamicin) for SAB/IE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C12">12</xref></sup> the characteristics and outcomes of patients were evaluated based on treatment setting during administration of iv antimicrobial therapy.

All patients or their authorized representatives provided written informed consent. While the trial was conducted in several countries, this analysis was limited to patients treated in the USA because of differences in outpatient antimicrobial treatment approaches outside of the USA.

Patients receiving their full course of antimicrobial therapy in the hospital setting, categorized as inpatient antimicrobial therapy (IPAT), were compared with those receiving some portion of antimicrobial therapy outside of the hospital, categorized as CoPAT. For the purposes of this analysis, IPAT was defined as all care in one or more of the following locations: (i) hospital intensive care unit; (ii) hospital step-down unit; and (iii) general hospital ward. CoPAT was defined as initial inpatient treatment followed by care in one or more of the following locations: (i) skilled nursing facility; (ii) assisted-living setting, nursing home or rehabilitation centre; (iii) at-home treatment with assistance; and (iv) at-home treatment without assistance. Escalation of care was defined as any transfer to a location providing a higher level of care, as ordered above, for example, from ward to intensive care unit or home to ward.</p><p>iv access for CoPAT was selected by individual physicians and established prior to hospital discharge. Antibiotics were pre-mixed by an infusion pharmacy and delivered every 48 h. Vancomycin was administered as an infusion over at least 1 h; daptomycin and semi-synthetic penicillin doses were infused over 30 min. Vancomycin and daptomycin infusions were administered by nurses in all settings. Patients receiving semi-synthetic penicillins at home were treated via an ambulatory infusion pump programmed by home care nurses to deliver doses at 4 h intervals around the clock. Nurses monitored patients' overall status and vital signs daily during CoPAT; physicians were notified of changes in conditions. Except for end of therapy and test-of-cure visits, physician office follow-up was not standardized. Per study protocol, blood chemistries, complete blood counts and creatine phosphokinase levels were obtained weekly in all care settings.</p><p>Patient characteristics and outcomes were analysed using Fisher's exact test for categorical data and a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous data.

It should be noted that these data are based on a variety of different infections&#x02014;including prosthetic infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis and soft tissue infections&#x02014;that may be expected to have lower rates of readmission than SAB.</p><p>Of additional interest are the results from a recently published UK study by Matthews <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C14">14</xref></sup> which compared &#x02018;self-administered&#x02019; OPAT (i.e. parenteral antibiotic therapy administered by patients, relatives or caretakers) with OPAT administered by community-based healthcare workers. This study, which analysed data collected over 13 years and included 2059 patients, found no significant difference between the two approaches in either hospital readmissions (10.5% versus 12.6%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.3) or complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C14">14</xref></sup> It should be noted that 39% and 26.3%, respectively, of patients whose therapy was self-administered or given by healthcare workers were being treated for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C14">14</xref></sup></p><p>In 1992, it was estimated that &#x0223c;300 000 Americans are treated annually with outpatient iv antimicrobial therapy;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C23">23</xref></sup> it is likely that the number of courses of therapy has increased since then. The savings associated with outpatient treatment in such a large number of patients could be significant, since hospital stay represents &#x0223c;60% to 90% of the total cost of treating serious infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C25">25</xref></sup> Data from the present study support findings from previous studies of decreased length of hospital stay, which has been shown to reduce costs and would also likely reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C18">18</xref></sup> Detailed economic analysis of this study is ongoing.</p><p>Previous experience with OPAT suggests that success is most likely in patients with uncomplicated infections and in situations where appropriate agents and means of delivery are available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C27">27</xref></sup> While there is a certain variability in the requirements for managing IE with outpatient therapy, guidelines created by the American Heart Association and endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) list the following minimal conditions for treatment in the home setting:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C27">27</xref></sup> reliable caretaker support and easy access to a hospital; regular visits by a home infusion nurse; and regular consultation (e.g. weekly) with a physician for assessment of clinical status. In the case of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> IE, more stringent guidelines have been suggested. These include: hospitalization during the initial 2 week critical period (and possibly for a continuation phase of up to 2&#x02013;4 weeks), patient education regarding potential complications as well as methods of contacting medical staff, proximity to the hospital, and biweekly office visits or home visits from the healthcare team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The optimal approach to outpatient treatment of SAB/IE for patients with a history of IVDU remains unclear. iv drug users typically respond well to treatment and have a similar, and possibly lower, mortality rate compared with other bacteraemia patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C30">30</xref></sup> The high cure rate among iv drug users with endocarditis has been partly attributed to the majority of infections involving the tricuspid valve, which responds particularly well to antimicrobial therapy as opposed to those involving the aortic or mitral valves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C31">31</xref></sup> Among iv drug users, the rate of complications does not appear to be higher overall compared with other patients, although limited data suggest a higher rate of vascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C28">28</xref></sup> The decision to discharge iv drug users to community settings is complicated by the potential for relapse of IVDU and suboptimal adherence to recommendations. These concerns may lead physicians to choose treatment settings with greater levels of supervision and structure. In this study, the rate of hospital readmission among iv drug users on CoPAT was nearly double that of CoPAT patients who were not iv drug users. It is worth noting that of the seven iv drug users readmitted to the hospital, two were found to have resumed use of iv drugs. Caution should be exercised in the selection and management of iv drug users who are candidates for CoPAT, as active drug use leads to safety and efficacy problems.</p><p>The current IDSA guidelines emphasize that when CoPAT therapy is considered, the antimicrobial agent selected should be effective against the causative pathogen, preferably dosed once daily, have a minimal adverse event profile, limited therapeutic drug monitoring and be stable in dosing formulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C32">32</xref></sup> The clinical trial upon which this analysis was based compared standard therapy (semi-synthetic penicillins or vancomycin with initial low-dose gentamicin) for SAB/IE with daptomycin, the first of a new class of cyclic lipopeptide antimicrobials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C12">12</xref></sup> The standard treatment options may pose logistical challenges when used for CoPAT. Semi-synthetic penicillins are considered standard therapy for SAB/IE caused by MSSA but may be difficult to administer in the outpatient setting because of the need for multiple daily doses (up to six times per day), as well as tolerability issues such as rash and diarrhoea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C34">34</xref></sup> Vancomycin is considered by many to be standard treatment for SAB/IE caused by MRSA, but it requires infusion over at least 1 h and therapeutic drug monitoring. In addition, a growing body of literature suggests inconsistent vancomycin efficacy because of changes in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> susceptibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C38">38</xref></sup> Alternative agents such as daptomycin, which are conducive to use in the outpatient setting, are needed, particularly for MRSA infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C42">42</xref></sup> Daptomycin is an effective alternative to standard therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C42">42</xref></sup> and its dosing schedule (once every 24 h for patients with a CL<sub>CR</sub> &#x02265;30 mL/min or once every 48 h when the creatinine is &#x0003c;30 mL/min) is convenient for CoPAT. After reconstitution and dilution in iv solution, daptomycin is stable under refrigeration for 48 h per the current FDA-approved package insert.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKP051C43">43</xref></sup></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The comparison of clinical outcomes between patients treated in the CoPAT and IPAT settings must be understood in the context of the patients' severity of illness. Candidates for outpatient antimicrobial therapy typically are stable patients at low risk of developing complications. The lower clinical success rate observed in the IPAT group in this study would be expected because of the greater severity of illness in these patients. One strength of this analysis is that it is based on data from a randomized, controlled clinical trial. However, the trial was not prospectively designed to assess outpatient versus inpatient care, and the retrospective nature of the current analysis may result in bias. In addition, as patients were followed only while receiving the study drug, treatment after study drug discontinuation was not captured.</p><p>It should be noted that outpatient antimicrobial therapy was provided at no cost as part of the trial, thereby potentially limiting the cost-related biases typically inherent in studies comparing inpatient with outpatient treatment. This aspect of the trial does not reflect real-life practice, where reimbursement for outpatient therapy varies depending on an individual's insurance coverage, and this may limit generalization of the study results. Furthermore, in analysing data only from US centres participating in the trial, the results draw on a smaller patient population than that of the original study, and may apply primarily in the USA.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that stable patients with SAB/IE can successfully complete iv antibacterial therapy in the outpatient setting. Proper monitoring of these patients is necessary, as changes in their conditions may necessitate an escalation of care. This study further demonstrates that daptomycin is an appropriate treatment option for patients with SAB/IE who are completing therapy in the outpatient setting. Additional research is warranted to define selection criteria for patients with SAB/IE who may be candidates for outpatient therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>The randomized clinical trial from which this study is derived was sponsored and funded by <grant-sponsor>Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lexington, MA, USA</grant-sponsor>.
