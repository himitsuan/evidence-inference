Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive up to eight 21-day cycles of open-label EOC (epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 and capecitabine 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1&#x02013;21) or modified-dose EOC plus panitumumab (mEOC+P; epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1&#x02013;21, and panitumumab 9 mg/kg on day 1). Randomisation was blocked and stratified for centre region, extent of disease, and performance status. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. After a preplanned independent data monitoring committee review in October, 2011, trial recruitment was halted and panitumumab withdrawn.

Safety, response, and survival outcomes were compared between standard EOC and modified EOC plus panitumumab (mEOC+P). The mEOC+P schedule was established in an unplanned dose-finding study,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> which was done because excessive toxicity (primarily diarrhoea) was noted when the drugs were initially combined at full dose. As reported previously,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> eligible patients had histologically verified, untreated, metastatic or locally advanced inoperable adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma of the oesophagus, gastro-oesophageal junction, or stomach. Patients were aged at least 18 years and had measurable disease on CT or MRI. Other eligibility criteria included WHO performance status of 0&#x02013;2, and adequate cardiac, renal, liver, and bone marrow function. Cardiac function was not formally measured at baseline unless there were concerns based on previous medical history. Renal, liver, and bone marrow function were assessed via routine blood tests (full blood count and biochemistry). Exclusion criteria included previous chemotherapy (including adjuvant chemotherapy), previous anti-EGFR therapy, known brain metastases, and clinically significant cardiac disease or other significant comorbidity. Recruitment largely predated routine HER2 testing in oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma and therefore HER2 status did not affect eligibility.</p><p>The study was done in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and the declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the North West Research Ethics Committee. All patients provided written informed consent before screening investigations.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>We randomly allocated patients (1:1) to standard EOC chemotherapy (intravenous epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, and oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on days 1&#x02013;21) or modified-dose EOC in combination with panitumumab (mEOC+P; intravenous epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, intravenous oxaliplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day on day 1&#x02013;21, and intravenous panitumumab 9 mg/kg on day 1) every 21 days. Randomisation was done independently at the Institute for Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU) by random permuted blocks (block sizes of six and eight) and stratified by centre region (locations were divided into 11 regions), extent of disease (locally advanced <italic>vs</italic> metastatic disease), and performance status (0 <italic>vs</italic> 1 <italic>vs</italic> 2). Patients were enrolled by trials office staff at the Royal Marsden Hospital, who then faxed confirmation of the allocated treatment group to local site staff. The trial was open-label with no masking of patients or study staff to the treatment allocation. Patients received a maximum of eight cycles of treatment. Advice regarding dose modifications for toxic effects was provided in the protocol (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause.

Details of the translational research methods are available in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>. Results from patient-reported outcomes will be reported separately.</p><p>Data for patients recruited at Royal Marsden Hospital were subject to source data verification by trust-appointed monitoring staff. For other UK centres, the sponsor deemed it appropriate, in keeping with good clinical practice requirements, to undertake central monitoring and provide sites with training meetings and written guidance to ensure appropriate conduct of the trial. Participating centres were required to provide evidence confirming patient eligibility, including blood test results, histopathology reports, and imaging reports to ensure appropriate randomisation and stratification at trial entry. During trial treatment, any discrepancies in data received compared with expected were queried with sites in real time. Recorded toxicities were cross-referenced against reported serious adverse events to ensure that all toxicities were captured and that all events meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event were reported as such.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The trial was powered to detect a 10% improvement in 1 year survival, from 45% for EOC to 55% with mEOC+P, equating to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0&#x000b7;749. To achieve 90% power and a two-sided &#x003b1; of 0&#x000b7;05, we needed to include 509 events (deaths from any cause) and planned a total accrual of 730 patients. We planned to do an interim survival analysis after 255 events (50%). We also did a preplanned non-comparative interim analysis of response rate with mEOC+P after the first 200 patients were assessable for response (phase 2 population). These data were reviewed by the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), and confirmed an acceptable response rate of 52% in the mEOC+P group, which exceeded the predefined futility threshold of 45%.</p><p>Throughout the trial, unmasked data were reviewed by the IDMC to examine the safety, scientific validity, and conduct of the trial. At annual review of the data in October, 2011, the IDMC noted a statistically inferior overall survival outcome in the mEOC+P group based on the occurrence of 169 events (HR 1&#x000b7;53, p=0&#x000b7;0062). In discussion with the trial management group, we decided to close the trial to further recruitment with immediate effect, withdraw panitumumab, and cross all patients over to full-dose EOC. We did our efficacy analyses in the intention-to-treat population, defined as all eligible randomised participants. Data for patients still on treatment were censored at the time of crossover to allow accurate comparison between the two trial groups. Toxicity analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug.</p><p>We estimated overall survival and PFS with the Kaplan-Meier method. We compared groups with the log-rank test and used Cox regression analysis to generate HRs and 95% CIs. We compared response rates between groups with logistic regression, and generated odds ratios and 95% CIs. We used the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test to compare incidence of toxic effects between groups. In multivariate analysis, we used forward stepwise Cox regression to calculate corrected HRs and 95% CIs.

A further exploratory analysis was therefore done including only 194 patients (177 with rash, 17 with no rash) who received at least four cycles of chemotherapy. Although possibly restricted by the smaller number of patients, in this analysis overall survival did not differ between patients who developed rash (median 10&#x000b7;6 months [95% CI 9&#x000b7;0&#x02013;12&#x000b7;2]) and those who did not (8&#x000b7;5 months [7&#x000b7;1&#x02013;9&#x000b7;9]; HR 0&#x000b7;64 [95% CI 0&#x000b7;37&#x02013;1&#x000b7;11], p=0&#x000b7;11).</p><p>Few tissue biomarker analyses have been undertaken to date. Frequencies of tested biomarkers in the first 200 patients are shown in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref> and have been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> For ten patients with known <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant tumours, we noted a potential association with benefit from mEOC+P, although this association was not significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).

No prognostic effect was associated with <italic>HER2</italic> or <italic>PTEN</italic> status, and no <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations were noted (data not shown). These biomarker analyses are exploratory and were limited by the small numbers of mutations identified to date. Further biomarker analyses are ongoing in the full trial cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p>The REAL3 trial is one of two concurrent randomised phase 3 trials (the other being the EXPAND trial<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>) assessing the addition of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies to chemotherapy in first-line oesophagogastric cancer. Based on the findings of REAL3, use of panitumumab in combination with EOC cannot be recommended in an unselected population with advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma, and was associated with inferior overall survival and PFS. Notably, this detrimental outcome in the experimental group was not predicted by the phase 2 endpoint of response rate (overall response rate 52% with mEOC+P). This trial does, however, confirm the efficacy of the EOC control group in this setting, with median overall survival and PFS results that are consistent with those previously reported in REAL2 (11&#x000b7;2 months for overall survival and 7&#x000b7;0 months for PFS).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>The poor outcome associated with mEOC+P in this trial did not seem to be attributable to increased treatment-related deaths, and therefore other potential explanations for our findings need to be considered. First, as reported previously,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> combination of panitumumab with full-dose EOC in the initial stages of the trial was associated with unacceptably high rates of grade 3 diarrhoea (four of the first five patients by cycle four). Therefore, we had to reduce the starting doses of oxaliplatin (by 23%) and capecitabine (by 20%) in the experimental group. Although these changes undoubtedly reduced the frequency of grade 3&#x02013;4 diarrhoea with mEOC+P (17% in phase 3 population), they also served to reduce the dose intensity of chemotherapy, which is reflected in the reduced incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy noted in the mEOC+P group. Additionally, the dose intensity data show a reduced proportion of patients achieving at least 80% of the planned capecitabine dose in the experimental group, suggesting that mEOC+P was still slightly more difficult to deliver than standard EOC.</p><p>Second, a negative interaction might have occurred between panitumumab and one or more of the EOC components. Evidence in the setting of colorectal cancer suggests that the chemotherapy partner for anti-EGFR therapy might be an important determinant of treatment efficacy, with oxaliplatin-containing regimens yielding inconsistent results. The OPUS<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and PRIME<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> studies provide evidence of improved outcomes with the addition of cetuximab and panitumumab respectively, whereas no benefit was associated with the addition of cetuximab in the COIN<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and NORDIC VII<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> studies in the same setting. Recent cell-line data also suggest that greater synergy might exist between anti-EGFR therapy and irinotecan than with oxaliplatin.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Additionally, the COIN trial<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> results suggest that there might be a differential benefit from cetuximab dependent on the fluoropyrimidine partner, with patients receiving oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil seemingly deriving increased benefit compared with those treated with oxaliplatin plus capecitabine. At present, the significance of these potential interactions is unknown, and has not been assessed in the setting of oesophagogastric cancer.</p><p>Third, our findings might have been affected because we assessed panitumumab therapy in a molecularly unselected population. During the years since the inception of the REAL3 trial, several studies have advanced our understanding of the EGFR signalling pathway and its role in oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Hot-spot mutations in key oncogenic drivers such as <italic>KRAS</italic> (common in colorectal cancer) and <italic>BRAF</italic> (common in malignant melanoma) are now known to be infrequent molecular events in oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Indeed, the 5&#x000b7;7% frequency of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation in our population is in keeping with the 3&#x02013;10% reported in other studies,<xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20&#x02013;22</sup></xref> and we did not note any <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations in 167 tumour samples tested. By contrast, gene copy number alterations (amplifications and deletions) seem to be a relatively frequent finding in oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma and are more likely to represent the key molecular alterations driving carcinogenesis. Two recent series<xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,24</sup></xref> of detailed genomic analyses in oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma reported that about 37% of tumours harbour copy number aberrations in genes that are deemed to be targetable, including <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>HER2</italic>, and <italic>MET</italic>. Randomised clinical trials are therefore needed to establish whether targeting of these oncogenic signal transduction pathways can meaningfully improve outcomes for patients.</p><p>In preclinical studies, cetuximab can decrease EGFR pathway signalling via reduced phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT in oesophagogastric cancer cell lines.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> In combination with chemotherapy, cetuximab results in synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis.<xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25&#x02013;27</sup></xref> In hypoxic gastric cancer cell lines the addition of anti-EGFR therapy reversed oxaliplatin resistance.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Additionally, a synergistic antitumour effect of combined cetuximab and S-1 was apparent in gastric cancer cell lines overexpressing EGFR.<xref rid="bib25 bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25,27</sup></xref> In colorectal cancer, somatic mutations in codon 12, 13, or 61 of the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene confer resistance to panitumumab therapy.<xref rid="bib11 bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,28</sup></xref> MET amplification with or without <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations might be associated with resistance to cetuximab therapy in gastric cancer cell lines;<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> however, no validated predictive biomarkers for this setting exist.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite preclinical data suggesting a role for anti-EGFR therapy in the treatment of oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma, the REAL3 trial findings are supported by two other phase 3 trials assessing anti-EGFR therapy in this disease setting. The EXPAND trial<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> assessed the addition of cetuximab to a cisplatin-capecitabine doublet in 904 patients with previously untreated adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastro-oesophageal junction, and did not meet its primary endpoint of improved PFS (HR 1&#x000b7;09, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;92&#x02013;1&#x000b7;29, p=0&#x000b7;32).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> EXPAND also noted no improvement with the addition of cetuximab in either overall survival (HR 1&#x000b7;00, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;87&#x02013;1&#x000b7;17, p=0&#x000b7;95) or overall response rate (30% in the experimental group <italic>vs</italic> 29% for controls). The COG trial<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> assessed the anti-EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor gefitinib compared with placebo in the second-line treatment of 450 patients with oesophageal and type I&#x02013;II gastro-oesophageal junction cancers. This trial also did not meet its primary endpoint, with no improvement in overall survival (HR 0&#x000b7;90, p=0&#x000b7;285). However, improvements in PFS (HR 0&#x000b7;795, p=0&#x000b7;017) and disease control at 8 weeks (25&#x000b7;5% in the experimental group <italic>vs</italic> 16&#x000b7;0% in controls, p=0&#x000b7;014) were noted, suggesting some activity of gefitinib in a small undefined subset of patients.</p><p>Taken together, these relatively consistent findings suggest that the EGFR pathway is unlikely to represent an important therapeutic target in most patients with oesophagogastric cancer (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>). The presented biomarker analyses accompanying the REAL3 trial are restricted by small patient numbers and low rates of tested mutations. However, this work is ongoing in the full trial dataset and these translational analyses represent a unique opportunity to further assess the molecular biology of advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma within a randomised trial setting. Techniques such as gene-expression profiling and next-generation sequencing might help to provide further information regarding the driver genetic events in this complex disease. Furthermore, the evaluation of genetic aberrations in pathways linked to EGFR signalling could still offer the prospect of identification of a low-frequency biomarker that identifies a subpopulation of patients benefiting from anti-EGFR targeted therapy in this setting.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><p><bold>This online publication has been corrected.

The epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine backbone was chosen after the REAL2 trial results. Emerging evidence had suggested EGFR overexpression was a relatively frequent occurrence in oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma, and possibly associated with inferior outcomes. Monoclonal antibodies directed against EGFR had already been shown to improve outcomes in combination with chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer, therefore there was interest in pursuing this combination as a possible therapeutic strategy in upper gastrointestinal malignancy. We searched PubMed for articles published in English with the MeSH terms &#x0201c;gastric cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;oesophageal cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;EGFR&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;panitumumab&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;cetuximab&#x0201d;. Searches were not restricted by date.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>Our results do not suggest a role for panitumumab in molecularly unselected patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. These findings are supported by negative results in two other phase 3 trials assessing anti-EGFR therapies in this disease setting (EXPAND<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and COG<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> trials). Collectively, these findings suggest that the EGFR pathway does not represent a good therapeutic target in unselected patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. However, ongoing tissue analyses might identify a biomarker-defined subgroup of patients who could derive benefit from this treatment strategy.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
