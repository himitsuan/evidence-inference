However, no direct data from randomized trials exists to support these indirect observations. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible relationship of aerobic exercise dose on cognition. Underactive or sedentary participants without cognitive impairment were randomized to one of four groups: no-change control, 75, 150, and 225 minutes per week of moderate-intensity semi-supervised aerobic exercise for 26-weeks in a community setting. Cognitive outcomes were latent residual scores derived from a battery of 16 cognitive tests: Verbal Memory, Visuospatial Processing, Simple Attention, Set Maintenance and Shifting, and Reasoning. Other outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and measures of function functional health. In intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses (n = 101), cardiorespiratory fitness increased and perceived disability decreased in a dose-dependent manner across the 4 groups. No other exercise-related effects were observed in ITT analyses. Analyses restricted to individuals who exercised per-protocol (n = 77) demonstrated that Simple Attention improved equivalently across all exercise groups compared to controls and a dose-response relationship was present for Visuospatial Processing. A clear dose-response relationship exists between exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. Cognitive benefits were apparent at low doses with possible increased benefits in visuospatial function at higher doses but only in those who adhered to the exercise protocol. An individual&#x02019;s cardiorespiratory fitness response was a better predictor of cognitive gains than exercise dose (i.e., duration) and thus maximizing an individual&#x02019;s cardiorespiratory fitness may be an important therapeutic target for achieving cognitive benefits.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01129115?term=NCT01129115&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01129115</ext-link>

Aerobic exercise (AEx)&#x02013;most commonly walking&#x02013;is accessible, cost effective [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], has proven health benefits [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and may protect against cognitive decline and dementia [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unlike with prescription drugs, however, the minimum and maximum effective exercise doses remain unknown.</p><p>Consensus guidelines, based on indirect data from epidemiological and prospective studies [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] state a dose-response relationship exists between exercise and health benefits. Some exercise is better than none and higher doses generally convey greater benefit. Epidemiological studies suggest this dose-response relationship also applies to cognitive outcomes, with greater cognitive performance and lower dementia risk in individuals who have greater levels of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131647.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131647.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with slower longitudinal cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. And in a parallel literature, exercise has demonstrated some effect in cognitively impaired older adults [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, no direct data from randomized trials exists to support these indirect observations and meta-analyses have not clearly demonstrated a linear relationship between fitness and cognition [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131647.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study examines the potential dose-response relationship of AEx on cognitive and functional outcomes for maximizing exercise-related cognitive benefit in older adults. To accomplish this, we performed a pilot randomized controlled 26-week trial of three doses of AEx representing 50%, 100%, or 150% of the recommended exercise dose of 150 minutes per week [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our goals were to test the ability of a community-based, semi-supervised exercise program to deliver a rigorously controlled exercise dose and perform a preliminary test of our hypothesis that low doses of AEx would provide some cognitive and functional benefits and that benefits would increase at higher doses of exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Study Design</title><p>The Trial of Exercise on Aging and Memory (TEAM: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01129115; trial active between 2/1/2010&#x02013;2/18/2014) was a 26-week pilot study of AEx dose in individuals 65 years and older without cognitive impairment.

We obtained written, informed consent under a study protocol (#11883) approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Review Board, which also acted as the human subjects research compliance entity for the YMCA of Greater Kansas City. The baseline evaluation included a thorough clinical examination by a trained clinician that included a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) to exclude the presence of dementia [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A trained psychometrician administered a comprehensive cognitive testing battery and the clinical and psychometric test results were reviewed and discussed at a weekly consensus conference that included clinicians, a neuropsychologist, and raters. All eligible participants were deemed cognitively normal as defined by a CDR of 0 (no dementia) and determination of no clinical significant impairment on cognitive tests as determined by clinical review. Eligible individuals then underwent physical function and cardiorespiratory fitness testing. The cognitive test battery at screening was used as baseline. The same testing was conducted again after 26 weeks of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>Participants were block randomized, stratified by age (split at 75) and sex, to ensure the groups were well-matched.

Personal trainers oversaw personalized prescription for weekly duration and intensity under the direction of the study team. At each session, participants manually recorded the duration of exercise on an exercise study log. All exercise groups began with a goal of 60 total minutes during Week 1 and increased their goal by approximately 21 min/wk until they achieved their exercise duration (i.e., 75, 150 or 225 min/wk, <xref rid="pone.0131647.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Participants exercised 3&#x02013;5 days a week, never more than 50 minutes a day to reduce likelihood of overuse injury. Intensity was prescribed as a target heart rate zone (F4 or FT4, Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY) based on percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR) as calculated by the Karvonen formula. In the first 4 weeks of exercise, the target heart rate zone was 40&#x02013;55% of HRR. In Weeks 5&#x02013;18, it was 50&#x02013;65% of HRR. In weeks 19&#x02013;26, it was 60&#x02013;75% of HRR.

VO<sub>2</sub> peak was as the highest observed value during a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test following the Cornell modified Bruce protocol [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To maximize validity of the test, all participants were required to achieve a respiratory exchange ratio of at least 1.0 before enrollment and exercise prescription.</p><p>Our primary objective measure of functional health was the Physical Performance Test (PPT) [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The Late-Life Function and Disability Index (LLFDI) and Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical and Mental Component Scores (SF-36v2, Quality Metric, Inc.) were considered primary measures of perceived functional health [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Our primary cognitive outcomes were domain latent factor scores constructed from a comprehensive cognitive test battery constructed to sample from five cognitive domains: Verbal Memory, Visuospatial Processing, Simple Attention, Set Maintenance and Shifting, and Reasoning.

We first tested group differences in cardiorespiratory fitness and functional ability outcome measures. For repeated measures (LLFDI, SF-36, PPT) we used mixed-effects models (SAS-9.4, PROC MIXED; Group + Time + Group-by-Time). For change scores (%&#x00394; in VO<sub>2</sub> peak) we used ANOVA (PROC-GLM). In cases where we detected group differences in these omnibus tests, we used a nested contrast analysis to characterize patterns in the group differences [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We posited that group differences would fit one of three patterns: 1) <italic>Practice Effect</italic>, equivalent improvement across ALL groups; 2) <italic>Intervention Effect</italic>, equivalent improvement across exercise dose (Control &#x0003c;75min/wk = 150min/wk = 225min/wk); 3) <italic>Linear Dose-Response</italic>, linear improvement across exercise dose (Control&#x0003c;75min/wk&#x0003c;150min/wk&#x0003c;225min/wk). Because of the pilot nature of the study and the broad consensus that exercise is systemically beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] we used 1-tailed tests (&#x003b1; = 0.05).</p><p>For cognitive outcomes, we tested latent factors using a well-validated [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] multistep structural equation model of latent residual scores (SEM-LRS) [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These models provide purer estimates of a given cognitive ability than raw test scores and isolate variance associated with specific cognitive domains. Use of composite cognitive domain scores has been suggested as a powerful alternative to raw scores [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Analyses were conducted in PROC CALIS with direct estimation using full information maximum likelihood. SEM-LRS uses the variance and covariance of multiple tests to predict group means and standard errors. (See <xref rid="pone.0131647.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for further description.)</p><p>Lastly, we explored the relationship of changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive outcomes. We used longitudinal mediation analysis [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to generate causal inferences about the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and cognition [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This approach specifically tested whether our experimental variable dose (duration of exercise in total minutes) drove cognitive change (latent residual score of a cognitive domain) directly or through cardiorespiratory adaptation (%&#x00394; in VO2peak).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><p>Of a potential 1,413 individuals who contacted the University of Kansas Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Center while the trial was active a total of 101 participants elected to participate, met criteria, and were randomized to one of the four intervention arms: no change control (n = 25), 75min/wk (n = 25), 150min/wk (n = 27), and 225min/wk (n = 24) of AEx.

Cardiorespiratory fitness is an important health measure, strongly linked to mortality, cardiovascular disease risk, functional health, and cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In older adults, cardiorespiratory fitness declines &#x0003e;2% a year [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that even modest levels of exercise in older adults provide fitness benefits, with increasing physiologic benefits at higher doses. These data reinforce the idea that systemic physiologic adaptations to exercise are well-preserved in older adults, even at low doses of AEx, and support the general consensus that greater benefits are achieved at higher doses of exercise. These findings also validate the rigorous delivery of varying doses of exercise through a community-based semi-supervised exercise program. Further, our results suggest achieving a modest goal of 75 min/wk of AEx provides benefits to cognition and perceived health, consistent with epidemiological data that high exercise levels are not necessary to achieve cognitive benefits [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The finding that cardiorespiratory adaptation predicts cognitive benefit may indicate that cardiorespiratory fitness (or aerobic capacity) is a useful therapeutic target for achieving cognitive benefits. If so, exercise prescription should be individualized to impact cardiorespiratory fitness rather than simply prescribing a standard amount of physical activity. Health care providers and exercise professionals can assist individuals following standard principles of exercise prescription, including varying frequency, intensity, time, and type of activity to maximize cardiorespiratory gain. Our finding that duration of exercise may be less important than the physiological cardiorespiratory fitness response also underscores prior work suggesting that subpopulations of non-responders with genetic or physiologic limiting factors may exist [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], warranting further investigation into predictors of exercise response.</p><p>We applied longitudinal modeling techniques to measure domain-specific cognitive changes. In the ITT cohort, we found no effect of exercise on cognitive performance. However, when we narrowed our analysis to those who exercised per-protocol, we found Simple Attention improved over 26 weeks for all exercise groups (but not in a dose-dependent manner) compared to controls and Visuospatial Processing improved non-linearly with increasing exercise dose. Our Visuospatial Processing factor is largely dependent on executive function, the cognitive domain that prior exercise studies have suggested most responds to exercise. Executive function is a loosely-defined concept that is dependent on selective attention, speed of processing, and visuospatial information. It is therefore likely that both our Attention and Visuospatial Processing domains reflect core features of executive function. We previously identified this Visuospatial Processing domain as one that declines in the years prior to the onset of dementia [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our finding that participants perceived dose-dependent improvement in disability (LLFDI) suggests gains in visuospatial function and attention may also be associated with real-world benefits.</p><p>This study has a number of notable strengths and limitations. Because this study was designed as a pilot trial to inform the development of more definitive trials, the sample size and intervention duration of 6-months are modest. Our control group had no sham activity and thus we are unable to control for psychosocial effects. We used intensive clinical methods (Clinical Dementia Rating) and a comprehensive cognitive testing battery to carefully exclude individuals with subtle cognitive impairment. As exercise intensity was standardized across groups, we have no direct data on the importance of exercise intensity, an important determinant of cardiorespiratory adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], in mediating cognitive benefits. Finally, exercise was semi-supervised after the first 6 weeks and thus at times exercise time and intensity was self-reported. Nevertheless, our community-based approach enhances the generalizability and ecological validity of the findings and we rigorously controlled the intervention across personal trainers and facilities through intensive training and monitoring to minimize variability in protocol delivery. Despite this, it was difficult for the 225/wk group to achieve their exercise goals. It may be that the rigid structure of a randomized controlled trial (e.g. controlled duration, exercise modality) impedes adherence at higher doses. Anecdotally, there were more reports of boredom in this group. While our results argue that this dose level is feasible for many, it remains to be seen if it is the most efficacious dose.</p><p>This 26-week pilot randomized controlled trial demonstrates a clear dose-response effect of AEx on cardiorespiratory fitness and suggests that a dose-response may be present for exercise-related cognitive benefits. Our data suggest that high levels of exercise are not necessary to achieve fitness and cognitive benefits in those who adhere to the exercise program, supporting the simple clinical directive that &#x02018;any exercise is good, more is better&#x02019;. Importantly, we found that the presence and degree of physiologic adaptation to AEx (i.e., increased VO<sub>2</sub> peak) is an important predictor of cognitive benefit. In fact, a physiologic response to exercise was a better predictor than exercise dose (total duration of exercise) in predicting cognitive benefits. This suggests that maximizing an individual&#x02019;s cardiorespiratory fitness may be an important therapeutic target to achieving visuospatial cognition and attention benefits. Public health efforts aimed at initiating and maintaining any dose of exercise remain important [<xref rid="pone.0131647.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] although greater benefits are likely to be achieved with higher doses and through achieving gains in cardiorespiratory fitness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131647.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Research protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131647.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131647.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Description and baseline performance on component cognitive tests.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131647.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Weekly progression of exercise duration in minutes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131647.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s006"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Table of log-likelihood values for SEM-LRS models showing the 5 derived cognitive domains.</title><p>The table shows that the 5 derived cognitive domains were identically configured and loaded consistently onto the domain factors at baseline and 6-month follow-up.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131647.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131647.s007"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Standardized change scores for the latent and component subtest scores in the Intent-to-Treat (n = 101) and Per-Protocol Cohorts (n = 77).</title><p>Values are normalized mean and standard error (M = 0, SE = 1).
