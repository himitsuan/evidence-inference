In the United States, there are approximately 190,000 cases per year of ALI with an associated death of 74,500 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. ALI is characterized by alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial barrier damage, resulting in exudation of protein-rich oedema fluid into the alveolar space, which causes functional impairment of the gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Uncontrolled and excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells, in particular neutrophils and macrophages, is a hallmark of ALI. Neutrophils are the main contributor in the pathogenesis of ALI. Indeed, there is a correlation between the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid and the severity of lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and persistence of neutrophils is associated with mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Neutrophils contribute to lung tissue destruction in ALI by producing tissue damaging agents such as reactive oxygen species, and granule-derived proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In ALI, extravasation of neutrophils into the alveolar space is associated with disruption of the endothelial barrier. The mechanisms by which neutrophils induce change in alveolar and capillary endothelial barrier permeability is not well known, but may involve, at least in part, heparin-binding protein (HBP).</p><p>HBP, also known as CAP37/azurocidin, is a 28 kDa protein belonging to the serprocidin subgroup of the chymotrypsin-like proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. HBP is contained in azurophilic granules and secretory vesicles of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HBP is released upon fusion of azurophilic granules and secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. The basal release of HBP is augmented upon &#x003b2;2 integrin-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. HBP is a multifunctional protein of inflammation that is responsible for a number of host response mechanisms to infection. HBP exhibits antimicrobial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], induces recruitment of monocytes to the site of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and augments macrophage phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Besides its beneficial effects during the immune response, HBP is also a potent inducer of endothelial hyperpermeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For example, neutrophil degranulation and the associated release of HBP, can be triggered by the binding of fibrinogen-coated M protein of <italic>streptococcus pyogenes</italic> to &#x003b2;2 integrins, which causes a toxic shock syndrome characterized by plasma leakage and multi-organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Statins are inhibitors of hydroxyl-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the enzyme which catalyses the second reaction in the mevalonate-dependent biosynthesis pathway. Statins are being investigated as a potential therapy for ALI. Statins attenuate lung injury <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice which have received aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and attenuate vascular leak and inflammation in murine inflammatory lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In humans, oral intake of simvastatin for 4 days attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to intravenous LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have recently shown that simvastatin reduces pulmonary inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> in healthy volunteers who have inhaled a low dose of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this human model of ALI, simvastatin reduced LPS-induced BAL neutrophilia, tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;, matrix metalloproteinases and C-reactive protein. In a recent randomized, double-blind trial of 60 patients with ALI (the HARP study), we showed that simvastatin induced modest improvement in non-pulmonary organ dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mechanisms by which simvastatin exerted its protective effect in the small single centre HARP study were unclear. We hypothesised that the levels of plasma HBP were elevated in patients with ALI and that the protective effects of simvastatin were mediated by reduced plasma HBP levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>The ALI population used to carry out this study has been previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This was a single-centre, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which patients with ALI were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg or placebo (1:1) for up to 14 days.</p><p>Baseline patient demographics, severity of illness scores were collected at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Briefly, 60 mechanically ventilated patients with ALI admitted to the regional Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland, were recruited to the study. Five healthy subjects were recruited by advertising to undergo plasma sampling. Screening consisted of history, physical examination, routine blood investigation, electrocardiogram and spirometry. Healthy subjects included 4 males and one female. Mean baseline of FEV1 (L) and FVC (L) were 4.2(0.5) and 5.2(0.75), respectively. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from the legal representative of the patient or the healthy individuals. The research was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of plasma samples</title><p>Blood was collected in lithium heparin tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Plymouth, UK) and placed immediately on ice until processed.

In contrast, and similarly to above (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A &#x00026; B), there was a significant decrease (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004) in HBP levels in patients treated with simvastatin at day 7 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C).

We have recently shown that oral administration of 80 mg simvastatin to patients with ALI reduced pulmonary and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Simvastatin improved systemic organ failure with a trend to improvement in respiratory dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Multi-organ dysfunction is caused, at least in part, by increased endothelial permeability and simvastatin has been shown to improve lung permeability in endotoxin-induced ALI in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As HBP derived from neutrophils disrupts endothelial integrity causing vascular leakage and organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we aimed to investigate the levels of plasma HBP in patients with ALI and if simvastatin modified those levels. As neutrophils play a central part in the pathogenesis of ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we hypothesised that HBP concentrations in plasma would be increased in patients with ALI. We found that plasma HBP levels in patients with ALI were significantly increased compared to healthy individuals. Other investigators found elevated levels of plasma HBP in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and HBP concentrations higher or equal to 15 ng/ml were found in 87% of critically ill patients with sepsis. Furthermore, when plasma HBP levels reached this threshold, there was a 4-fold increase of the mortality rate among patients with sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We next investigated whether plasma HBP level was associated with mortality. We found that plasma HBP levels at enrolment were not significantly different between patients with ALI surviving ICU admission or not. In contrast, other investigators found elevated HBP levels at admission in other diseases including sepsis, and this was associated with an increased mortality at 28 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We also observed that HBP levels decreased significantly at day 7 versus day 0 in ICU survivors but not in ICU non-survivors. Based on these findings, we propose that normalization of plasma HBP level over the time, rather than the concentration of HBP at enrolment, is associated with recovery. It is plausible that strategies to decrease plasma HBP levels may reduce endothelial leak and may be a potential therapeutic strategy to further investigate.</p><p>Simvastatin reduces pulmonary and systemic inflammation in patients with ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in a human model of ALI induced by inhaled LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether simvastatin reduced plasma HBP levels in patients with ALI. We found that patients treated with simvastatin had a greater fold reduction in plasma HBP levels at day 7 versus day 0 than those who received placebo. This relation persisted when corrected for neutrophil count suggesting this is not simply a reflect of reduced peripheral neutrophil counts but reduced neutrophil activation.</p><p>The relatively small sample size used in this study limits the interpretation of the data. Although we found that decreased plasma HBP levels was associated with survival and simvastatin decreased plasma levels of HBP in patients with ALI, simvastatin did not improve ALI survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It would be necessary to conduct a larger study in patients with ALI to confirm the association between the administration of simvastatin, reduced plasma levels of HBP, and survival which is ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which characterise ALI, induce expression of &#x003b2;2 integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1) on the membrane surface of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and switch these adhesion receptors from a low to a high affinity ligand binding conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This change in conformation allows the &#x003b2;2 integrins to bind endothelial ligands, which is a prerequisite for extravasation and activation of neutrophil inflammatory functions including degranulation (and release of HBP). Interestingly, statins have been shown to bind to an allosteric site within the &#x003b2;2 integrin LFA-1 which prevents LFA-1 interacting with endothelial ligands. This has been shown to impair migration of neutrophils in a murine peritonitis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although statins do not bind Mac-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the dominant &#x003b2;2 integrin expressed in neutrophils, simvastatin has been shown to reduce expression of Mac-1 on the membrane surface of circulating neutrophils by reducing the level of pulmonary CXC chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Accordingly, potential mechanism for our finding is that simvastatin blocks &#x003b2;2 integrin-dependent release of HBP and other granule proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has shown that the concentration of HBP in plasma was increased in patients with ALI compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, we found that at day 7 after onset of ALI, high plasma HBP levels was associated with mortality. Simvastatin was associated with greater reduction in plasma HBP. A greater reduction in plasma HBP may be one of the mechanism by which simvastatin exerts a potential protective effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALI: Acute lung injury; ARDS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome; BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage; HBP: Heparin-binding protein; LPS: Lipopolysaccharide.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors do not have a financial relationship with a commercial entity that has an interest in the subject of this manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>DFA designed the study, analyzed the data, and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.
