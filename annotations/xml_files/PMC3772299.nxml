Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel had been considered the standard treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), because DAPT has been shown to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) or death from cardiovascular (CV) causes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2)</xref> Nevertheless, the incidence of ischemic events remains high among patients with ACS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref></p><p>Clopidogrel is a pro-drug that is converted to its active metabolite principally by cytochrome (<italic>CYP</italic>) <italic>P4502C19</italic>, at which time it inhibits platelet activation by irreversibly binding the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor. Genetic polymorphisms in <italic>ABCB1</italic> and <italic>CYP2C19</italic> may affect the absorption and metabolism, respectively, of clopidogrel, and consequently alter its pharmacodynamics. As a result, there exists high interindividual variability in the responsiveness to clopidogrel and on-treatment platelet reactivity (OPR).

A second bolus of unfractionated heparin (70 U/kg) was administered immediately before the PCI. Additional heparin was administered to achieve an activated clotting time of 250-300 seconds.

In the genotype-directed group, there were five crossover cases from ticagrelor to clopidogrel because of dyspnea (2 patients), nasal bleeding (1 patient), petechia on the whole body (1 patient), and generalized rash (1 patient). In the phenotype-directed group, one crossover from ticagrelor to clopidogrel occurred due to dyspnea.

HOPR with clopidogrel treatment has also been proposed to be a predictor of ischemic CV events in patients undergoing DES implantation. To date, there is little consensus on the treatment options to overcome HOPR. Studies examining the effect of high- versus standard-dose clopidogrel have yielded discrepant findings.

Because of the concern of the increased risk of bleeding, the use of parasugrel or ticagrelor is not yet widespread in Korea, even among the ACS population after PCI. Further study is therefore warranted on the effects of reduced doses of prasugrel or ticagrelor on the clinical endpoints in Korean ACS patients.</p><p>The use of point-of-care testing to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to risk stratification for bleeding and ischemia represents an ideal strategy for ACS patients. Among these tests, the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay to measure OPR is increasingly being used given the evidence suggesting an association between HOPR and CV events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15)</xref> However, there are several shortcomings to measuring OPR: 1) OPR is a surrogate marker only representing the inhibition of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor mediated platelet activation, not whole platelet activity; 2) OPR cannot be measured in patients treated with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors or thrombolytics; 3) PRU value varies with elapsed time following ACS or PCI;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26)</xref> 4) the cutoff for HOPR varies according to patient ethnicity;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> and 5) the relationship between low OPR and bleeding events has yet to be definitively established. Moreover, trials in which antiplatelet therapy has been personalized according to the results of the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay have failed to demonstrate any improvement in outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27)</xref></p><p>By comparison, genotyping can be carried out under any clinical circumstances with no limitations with respect to timing. In previous studies, <italic>CYP2C19 <sup>*</sup>2</italic> or <italic><sup>*</sup>3</italic> carriers have been shown to have higher OPR and poor clinical outcomes with clopidogrel use after PCI, compared with <italic>CYP2C19 <sup>*</sup>2</italic> or <italic><sup>*</sup>3</italic> non-carriers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28)</xref> However, genotyping also has its drawbacks. Clopidgrel is a pro-drug that is converted to an active metabolite in two hepatic steps involving <italic>CYP1A2</italic>, <italic>2C9</italic>, <italic>2C19</italic>, <italic>3A4/5</italic>, not only by <italic>2C19</italic>.

Nevertheless, the benefits of genotype- and phenotype-directed individualization of antiplatelet therapy to improve clinical outcomes requires validation though further randomized, controlled trials.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>A potential limitation of the present study relates to the early termination of the trial due to the unavailability of the Verigene CLO assay during the study. Furthermore, the crossover rate from ticagrelor to clopidogrel was higher in the genotype- versus the phenotype-directed group, possibly due to the higher number of patients allocated ticagrelor in the genotype-directed group. Moreover, there was no standard care control group comparing genotype- versus phenotype-directed antiplatelet therapy. Finally, our analyses were based on a single determination of the PRU value, which is subject to random measurement error and may possibly have underestimated the strength of the associations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, tailoring the use of P2Y12 inhibitors based on point-of-care genetic and phenotypic testing may be effective in decreasing HOPR after 30 days.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a research grant from the Korean Society of Circulation (2011-12).</p></ack><fn-group><fn

versus the one-month follow-up (D 30) according to the personalization strategy for antiplatelet therapy (A) and the type of antiplatelet agent (B). OPR decreased following both genotype- and phenotype-directed therapies (242&#x000b1;83 vs. 109&#x000b1;90, p&#x0003c;0.001 in the genotype-directed group; 216&#x000b1;74 vs. 109&#x000b1;90, p=0.001 in the phenotype-directed group). Five subjects (16.2%) in the genotype-directed group and one (3.3%) in the phenotype-directed group had HOPR after 30 days of treatment (p=0.086). After 30 days of treatment, OPR was lower (49&#x000b1;30 vs. 179&#x000b1;77, p&#x0003c;0.001) among patients administered ticagrelor as compared to clopidogrel.
