Twenty-one children with DCD were split into either QET (8 male 3 female, mean age of 8.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.04) or technical training (TT) groups (7 male 3 female, mean age of 8.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.84). The TT group were given movement-related instructions via video, relating to the throw and catch phases, while the QET group were also taught to fixate a target location on the wall prior to the throw (QE1) and to track the ball prior to the catch (QE2). Each group partook in a 4-week, group therapy intervention and measurements of QE duration and catching performance were taken before and after training, and at a 6-week delayed retention test. Parental feedback on psychosocial and motor skill outcomes was provided at delayed retention. Children improved their gaze control and catching coordination following QET, compared to TT. Mediation analysis showed that a longer QE aiming duration (QE1) predicted an earlier onset of tracking the ball prior to catching (QE2) which predicted catching success. Parents reported enhanced perceptions of their child&#x02019;s catching ability and general coordination in the QET group compared to the TT group. All parents reported improvements in their child&#x02019;s confidence, social skills and predilection for physical activity following the trial. The findings offer initial support for an intervention that practitioners could apply to address deficits in the motor and psychosocial skills of children with DCD.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial registration</italic>: ClinicalTrials.gov</bold>

The condition is categorised as a marked impairment in the development of motor coordination that interferes with activities of daily living below the level expected for the child&#x02019;s chronological age, which must not be attributable to neurological conditions, sensory problems or low intelligence [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While the aetiology of DCD is still poorly understood, children with DCD suffer motor deficits related to internal (forward) modelling, rhythmic coordination, executive function, gait and postural control, catching and interceptive action, and sensoriperceptual function [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In an effort to understand more about the mechanisms behind such deficits, researchers have explored the role and control of vision in children with DCD, compared to typically developing (TD) children. A body of evidence has linked DCD to significant impairments in general visuomotor control and the processing of task-relevant, visual information [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the ability to use predictive information to guide action [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; the pursuit tracking of objects [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; and the ability to maintain fixation on visual targets [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While some of this research is laboratory-based, these deficits in the control of vision have obvious implications for the production and control of coordinated movement in the &#x02018;real-world&#x02019;. For example, the ability to maintain a fixation on a visual target and track an object is fundamental for aiming and interception skills that are the building blocks for activities in sport and playground games.</p><p>Throwing and catching is a perfect example of a task where these visual abilities are critical and it is unsurprising that children with DCD find this task difficult. In a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we explored the visual control of children in a task that required them to throw a ball against a wall and subsequently catch it. In this study we measured&#x02013;using a measure of optimal visual control derived from sport (the quiet eye (QE) [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>])&#x02014;the duration of time children spent fixating a target before throwing (QE1) and the duration of time spent pursuit tracking the ball prior to the catch attempt (QE2). These QE durations provide periods of pre-programming that assist with thrower&#x02019;s predictions of the location of the bounce point on the wall and subsequent location and timing of the interception point of the catch [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Results suggested that highly proficient children demonstrated longer QE aiming fixations (QE1) before the release of the ball and longer QE pursuit tracking durations (QE2) on the ball prior to the catch. Mediation analyses revealed that the superior performance of the high motor proficient children was underpinned by an earlier and longer QE2 before the catch attempt [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, in further studies we have demonstrated that teaching participants to adopt the QE strategy of skilled children through observing video footage of their eye-movements (QE training; QET), improved catching technique in children with average motor skill ability [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and children with DCD [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the latter study, DCD children who were given a brief QET intervention experienced significant improvements in their catching coordination and catching kinematics. Moreover, these benefits were maintained even after a 6-week detraining period. A control group, who received typical movement-focused instructions, revealed no improvement in catching technique at the 6-week delayed retention test [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The authors concluded that QET served to improve the attentional control of these children, providing more optimal aiming behaviour (QE1) and more time to track the early flight phase of the ball as it came towards them (QE2). As impairments in the ability to maintain target-focused fixations and pursuit tracking of objects has been shown to be characteristic of DCD [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we believe that QET, a strategy that has been shown to teach this form of top-down attentional control [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], may be effective in the treatment of this condition.</p><p>The motor deficiency associated with DCD also has severe consequences for the psychosocial development and wellbeing of the children who suffer from it. For example, children with DCD report being excluded (by either their peers or themselves) from partaking in physical activities or playground games [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This exclusion has an additive negative effect on their psychosocial development, resulting in children with DCD experiencing loneliness, victimisation and feelings of rejection by their peers [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and lower levels of confidence, self-esteem and self-worth [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to alleviate the tendency for social exclusion, studies have examined the effectiveness of group-based training interventions for children with DCD. Group-based therapy might not only be more effective than individual-based therapy in improving motor skills in children with DCD [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but may also improve psychosocial variables [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, not only is group therapy more time efficient and cost effective for the therapist, parents of children with DCD emphasise the importance of their children being able to participate in organised, physical activity groups and value therapy that improves their child&#x02019;s perceptions of self-confidence and competence over those that just focus on improving motor abilities [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These views have led to suggestions that therapeutic interventions should therefore focus on enhancing the social, as well as the physical, skills of children with DCD [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this study were two-fold. First, we sought to build upon Miles et al.&#x02019;s positive findings for QET for children with DCD [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] by adopting multiple sessions of training, in an attempt to increase the training effect and to more closely resemble typical therapy. We hypothesised that QET would significantly improve the catching performance of children with DCD compared to a group receiving typical, technical instructions by improving their visuomotor control. Specifically, we hypothesised that QET would facilitate more optimal aiming behaviour (longer aiming durations prior to the throw; QE1) and quicker and longer tracking durations of the ball prior to the catch (QE2). Furthermore, we hypothesised that these visuomotor improvements for the QET group would mediate the predicted performance advantage in catching for QET children. Specifically, mediation analysis should reveal that a longer QE aiming duration (QE1) predicts an earlier onset of tracking the ball prior to catching (QE2) which predicts catching performance [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>A second aim was to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using a group-based therapy approach as a framework for the delivery of this intervention. We hypothesised that regardless of the intervention received, parents would report that their children found the intervention to be more beneficial than typical, individual, therapy and would consequently report increases in their children&#x02019;s confidence, enjoyment and predilection for sport or physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-one children, aged 7&#x02013;11 years old, were recruited from local DCD support groups, social media, and local occupational therapy centres in the North West of England.

During the baseline phase, children attended the laboratory individually, and following the completion of written consent, completed the MABC-2 protocol. Prior to completing the throwing and catching task, each participant was calibrated to the eye-tracker using nine locations on the wall to which he/she were required to throw the ball against. They then completed five blocks of 10 trials of the MABC-2 throw and catch task. Participants were then pseudo-randomly divided into two experimental groups based on this initial throwing and catching performance. The procedure for the retention and delayed retention phases replicated the baseline phase. The retention phase occurred 1 week after the end of the training phase (week 6) and the delayed retention phase took place 6-weeks after this point. During the delayed-retention phase, parents completed the parental feedback questionnaire while their child completed the throwing and catching task procedure.

A measure of catching quality was also determined from the video footage providing a more sensitive measure of catching performance. Whereas catch success is binary (only a perfect catch can be considered successful), a technique score recognises differences in the quality of the attempt to catch, and awards more points to better attempts. For example, using the binary catching success measure, children who make no reaction to the ball as it comes back to them are awarded the same score (0) as a child who fumbles the ball or manages to catch it by trapping it against their arms. The catching performance scale recognises and quantifies these distinct differences in catch attempts. The catching performance scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0171782.t003">Table 3</xref> [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) consisted of an 11-point scale whereby catch attempts were given a score between &#x02018;0&#x02019; (Makes no move towards the ball as it comes back) and &#x02018;10&#x02019; (The catch is made exclusively with the palms and fingers).

By combining QET with group-based therapy, we hoped to integrate an intervention that improves skill acquisition in children with poor motor coordination, within an approach that may help ameliorate the psychosocial influence of these motor skill deficits. Our long-term aim was to work towards a holistic intervention for children with DCD that health professionals can use in their therapeutic practice.</p><p>In line with our hypotheses and prior research [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], QET children learned to aim effectively which enabled them to predict the ball&#x02019;s bounce point on the wall and track its trajectory for longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171782.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Mediation analysis showed that longer aiming durations (QE1) predicted an earlier onset of tracking the ball prior to catching (QE2) which predicted catching success [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In short, this optimization of gaze provided children with earlier information on which to prepare the interceptive catch attempt [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171782.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, after completing the QET intervention the QE durations used by these DCD children when aiming (QE1 mean 592ms) and tracking the ball (QE2; mean 254ms) were almost identical to the durations that highly skilled children used to aim (QE1 mean 496ms) and track the ball (QE2 mean 255ms) in the same task [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>These changes in visuomotor control were also reflected in children&#x02019;s catching performance. While the improvement between groups in the dichotomous measure of catch success was not significantly different (despite the QET group improving by 51% compared to the TT improvement of 31%) the more sensitive catching score measure did show significant differences as we hypothesised. Specifically, QET individuals significantly improved their catching technique from baseline to retention and maintained this improvement at the delayed retention test. Conversely, the TT individuals did not significantly improve their catching technique throughout the experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171782.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In effect, this meant that after training, the QET children were able to catch the ball cleanly with both hands before securing it against their body (mean score of 8), whereas the TT group were catching the ball by trapping it against their body with their arms, rather than grasping it with their hands (mean score of 6). Future analyses will attempt to quantify these changes in terms of patterns of motor coordination and muscular activity.</p><p>Results from both the gaze and performance data highlight some important implications. First, regardless of the training intervention, all children were able to improve on this interceptive motor task; highlighting the important distinction that DCD should be considered as impaired motor proficiency rather than a fundamental inability to learn motor skills [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Second, DCD children can learn to make more functional eye movements that can directly compensate for the oculomotor atypicalities associated with this disorder [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Third, QET instructions appear to deliver more effective retention of interceptive skill than typical, explicit instructions focusing on movement control. These benefits are likely due to reduced demands on cognitive load supporting motor control [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the promotion of a more implicit motor learning environment [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]: Rather than having to consciously think about the complex control of multiple limbs, these are guided implicitly once gaze control is optimised. Previous research has identified that implicit motor learning is an effective strategy for children with DCD [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], perhaps due to how it overcomes deficits in working memory resources [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, while the specific mechanisms underpinning the QET benefits warrant further investigation [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], there appears to be clinical utility in exploring the application of QET to other tasks where children with DCD experience difficulties.</p><p>Interestingly, the improvements in motor coordination displayed by the children were reflected in the perceptions of their parents. Parents of children in the QET group reported that their children had improved their throwing and catching ability and overall coordination to a greater extent than parents of TT children (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0171782.t004">Table 4</xref>). We also found that parents of children in both groups reported that the intervention had improved their child&#x02019;s confidence, social behaviours and predilection for sport as we hypothesised. Despite these promising findings, we must add a cautionary caveat here highlighting that we used an unvalidated parental feedback questionnaire and a relatively small sample size. Future research should use validated inventories (e.g., the Children Performance Skills Questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) with a larger sample of children in order to explore these findings further. Additionally, parental perceptions of their child&#x02019;s predilection for sport or physical activity could also be more objectively measured (e.g., accelerometers) in future work in order to build on these initial results. Despite these limitations, there does appear to be considerable psychosocial benefits of group-based training irrespective of the specific content of the session and the extent of any motor improvements [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The positive results of the study lead us to suggest a number of cautionary applied recommendations to enhance the therapeutic experience of children with DCD. First, we wish to echo previous recommendations that interventions for children with DCD must aim to improve both the motor deficits and psychosocial consequences of the disorder [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Applied practitioners may benefit from developing innovative ways to incorporate group-based therapy sessions. While the clinical setting may not be the best place to achieve this aim, other organisations such as local councils, schools, national governing sporting bodies and professional sports clubs may have a part to play in supporting such initiatives. Either way, a group-therapy approach is something that children with DCD and their parents find beneficial and there is currently a lack of provision for these types of activities, particularly in the UK.</p><p>Second, it seems that instructions that optimise the visual attention of children with DCD have real and durable benefits for motor skill attainment in this catching task. As children with DCD generally struggle to develop effective learning strategies on their own&#x02013;they generally persist with ineffective ones [<xref rid="pone.0171782.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]&#x02013;equipping them with a strategy that has been proven to expedite the learning process in a number of tasks and populations seems a logical step for applied practitioners to take. Understandably, to achieve this will take a greater collaboration between the scientists who are familiar with these methods and the practitioners who will be at the forefront of their delivery.</p><p>In conclusion, we aimed to develop a holistic intervention for children with DCD that would not only alleviate some of the visuomotor deficits that they experience but also improve some of the psychosocial consequences of the disorder. By combining an intervention (i.e., QET) that has been shown to improve motor learning in children with DCD within a group-based therapy framework, we believe that this aim has been achieved. Future research in now needed to establish the feasibility and practicality of incorporating these ideas into applied therapeutic practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171782.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171782.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171782.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>The original study protocol taken from NHS ethics application.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171782.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171782.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Instructional videos.</title><p>Summarising the instructions given to the QET and TT groups.</p><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171782.s003.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the parents and children who volunteered to take part in the study.
