Increased prevalence rates are concerning given obesity&#x02019;s association with chronic illnesses and risk factors for death, including hypertension, stroke, type-2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Obesity, which places a large economic burden on health care systems due to medical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], can be addressed through public health and behavioral interventions. Research focused on improving behavioral treatment outcomes for obesity is greatly needed.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, we investigated the effect of administering motivational interviewing (MI) to adults with overweight and obesity who had already voluntarily enrolled in a behavioral weight-loss program (BWLP). MI is a counseling strategy that aims to assist and motivate individuals in moving towards behavioral change. BWLPs attempt to address environmental causes of obesity by increasing energy expenditure and decreasing energy intake through behavioral changes, and are usually the first line of weight-loss treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A BWLP typically includes dietary intervention, physical activity change, and behavioral self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In addition to yielding small to moderate weight reductions in populations with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], randomized controlled evaluations of BWLPs have also demonstrated dietary improvements and increases in levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, there is room for improvement with current BWLPs. Participants in these programs typically lose approximately 5 to 10% of their weight from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Weight loss appears to plateau at the 10% mark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], despite considerable attempts to improve BWLP outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Two major issues in BWLPs that may limit the effectiveness of treatment are high rates of attrition and poor adherence to the treatment program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Given that MI focuses on assisting and motivating individuals towards behavioral change, it might improve weight-loss treatment outcomes by enhancing treatment engagement and improving adherence to dietary and exercise requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A research base examining the integration of MI with BWLP is growing. A meta-analysis examining the effects of MI on weight loss found a moderate effect of MI on body mass using a random effects model (standardized mean difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.51) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On average, MI enhanced weight loss by 1.47&#x000a0;kg relative to control conditions, and studies that included weight loss as a primary outcome and/or employed MI as an adjunct to a BWLP demonstrated the best results. However, of the five studies that examined the effect of adding MI to a BWLP in this meta-analysis, three failed to find any weight-loss benefit for MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Proposed reasons for these null findings included socioeconomic barriers to change faced by certain samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], inadequate sample size, lack of or uncertain treatment fidelity, and inadequate long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Another study investigating MI as an adjunct to an Internet-based BWLP also failed to find an effect of MI on weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, these authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported that among individuals with high baseline levels of controlled motivation (i.e., external pressure to change), those receiving MI showed greater weight loss than those receiving BWLP only, suggesting that baseline levels of motivation might help to identify who will benefit most from adding MI to a BWLP. Overall, evidence is mixed regarding with which individuals MI is an effective adjunct to BWLPs. There is a need for methodologically rigorous research that maximizes the efficacy of MI adjunct to BWLPs.</p><p id="Par25">The constructs of importance, confidence, and readiness for change are considered critical elements in the conceptualization of motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Reviews suggest that confidence and readiness to change, in particular, are modifiable aspects which can help prevent excessive gestational weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While other fields incorporating MI with existing treatments, including substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and gestational weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], have studied these constructs, the constructs have been largely unexplored in the MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP literature. It is unclear if MI, when added to a BWLP, affects these dimensions of change, or if they help to distinguish individuals who might benefit from MI.</p><p id="Par26">The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of adding two MI sessions to a BWLP among adults seeking weight loss. We modeled our methods on the study that has demonstrated the largest effect to date of MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP on weight loss, namely West and colleagues&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] study of women with obesity and type-2 diabetes which included an attention control condition, assessed treatment fidelity, and tested a large sample size. Additionally, we explored individual differences in factors related to motivation for change, including ratings of importance of, readiness for, and confidence for, change.</p><p id="Par27">We hypothesized that participants in a BWLP who also received MI would reduce body weight by end of treatment and at a 6-month follow-up to a greater degree than controls. In addition, given that MI has shown promise for improving adherence to BWLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we hypothesized that the MI group would show greater adherence to the BWLP than the control group. Given that MI specifically aims to enhance self-efficacy and motivation, an exploratory hypothesis was that the MI group would report greater importance, confidence, and readiness for change ratings immediately after both MI sessions relative to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par28">This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of an MI intervention on body mass and related outcomes in adults with overweight and obesity who had voluntarily self-enrolled and paid for TrymGym, a 12-week, 24-session BWLP at the University of Calgary. An additional file shows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Checklist for randomized trials (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Eligible participants were randomized to receive either two MI intervention sessions or two attention-control interviews in addition to the BWLP, with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The estimated sample size needed in each condition was 45, determined by an a-priori power estimate for two groups with alpha set at 0.05, power at 0.80, and anticipating a medium effect size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We chose a medium effect size on the basis of a meta-analysis of MI for weight loss available at the time of study design that reported an overall medium effect of .53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To account for anticipated attrition of 32% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we recruited 135 participants in total.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par29">Recruitment took place from September 2007 to May 2009.

Participants were eligible if they were 18&#x000a0;years or older and in the Body Mass Index (BMI) range of overweight or obesity (BMI &#x02265;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

Individuals who expressed interest in participating were contacted by phone and screened for eligibility by a research assistant. If eligible, an appointment was made for the first MI/control session within the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of the BWLP. Participants were asked to complete change rating questionnaires prior to this interview (i.e., importance, readiness, and confidence for change ratings), and randomization occurred immediately prior to this interview. After the first interview, participants completed a second MI/control session approximately during the 12th week of the program. Finally, participants were contacted approximately 5&#x000a0;months following program completion to schedule a 6-month in-person follow-up assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Behavioral weight-loss program</title><p id="Par31">TrymGym was established in 1973 at a large medical-doctoral university in Calgary and over 10,000 participants have completed the program. This BWLP emphasizes gradual, sustainable weight loss and lifestyle changes, and is delivered by a team of health care practitioners including dietitians, kinesiologists, and fitness instructors via both classroom sessions and exercise sessions. Specifically, the program consists of three core components: (1) Nutrition: individualized guidelines for healthy eating, based on the Canada Food Guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], were developed for each participant, (2) Physical activity: group exercise classes focused on fat loss, strength training, and development of endurance and flexibility, and (3) Behavior change: behavioral strategies including self-monitoring, goal-setting, and formulating action plans to achieve goals were taught in classroom sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Motivational interviewing intervention</title><p id="Par32">The semi-structured MI protocol was a 45-min intervention developed by the first author based on general MI principles and guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], MI strategies specific to health care practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and MI principles for obesity treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The MI protocol included the following components: (1) eliciting concerns about weight, (2) exploring ambivalence, (3) assessing importance and confidence for change, (4) writing a decisional balance, (5) bolstering self-efficacy, (6) looking towards the future, and (8) eliciting ideas for possible changes participant could make to work towards weight loss. The protocol for both MI sessions consisted of similar components.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Attention control intervention</title><p id="Par33">The attention control interview was a semi-structured interview addressing health history, weight history, diet history, and dietary and physical activity habits. Most questions were drawn from the TrymGym intake application. It was designed to be structurally equivalent to the MI session in length of session, timing of sessions, and treatment modality. The goal was to provide a pseudo-intervention that controlled for factors common to attending treatment (e.g., attending treatment sessions, having personal contact with a therapist, discussing weight-related issues).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Therapist training and supervision</title><p id="Par34">The first author delivered all of the MI and control sessions, both for practical reasons and to help control for possible therapist effects.

One of the most significant benefits of LMM is the capacity of this analysis to flexibly handle missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The observed data showed nonlinear trends in the outcome variable, so longitudinal trends for the outcome variable were modeled using time as a categorical variable; specifically time 2 (period from baseline to the end of the BWLP) and time 3 (period from baseline to 6-month follow-up). Initially, the potential interaction between group and time was examined by entering the following variables: group, time, baseline value of outcome variable, and the interaction term between time and group. In this model, the interaction term determined if the intervention effect varied between groups. If the interaction term was nonsignificant, the model was refitted with only the main effect terms. For the main effect model, if the &#x0201c;time&#x0201d; variable was significant, contrasts were specified to examine change relative to baseline. Alpha was set at .05. The structure of the repeated measures was modeled by including intercept as a random effect at the subject level. Model estimates were obtained using maximum likelihood estimation (ML) implemented with the linear mixed models module of SPSS. In the analysis, a variance-components variance-covariance matrix was estimated.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par53">These results indicate that participants&#x02019; weight decreased from baseline to the end of the BWLP in both the MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP and BWLP-only (control) groups, but the addition of MI did not enhance weight loss. However, no change in participants&#x02019; body weight in either group was observed between baseline and 6-month follow-up, indicating that BWLP effects were not sustained, possibly due in part to the brevity of the 12-week BWLP. Supporting this interpretation, a meta-analysis found that BWLP durations longer than 6&#x000a0;months generally yielded more weight loss relative to briefer BWLPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and this increased initial weight loss may delay potential weight regain. Furthermore, results showed that participants who had received MI were no more likely to have attended more treatment sessions than control participants. Additionally, self-report ratings of importance, readiness, and confidence for change did not differ between groups after the first or second MI/control session, indicating that the MI also had no effect on these critical elements in the conceptualization of motivation. Although we assessed the effects of the MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP intervention on several additional indices of health outcomes (i.e., BMI, physical activity, dietary behavior, blood pressure, and eating disorder psychopathology), we found similar results as for the weight, adherence, and change rating outcomes described above. Overall, the addition of MI to the BWLP did not change outcomes on any of these measures (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> for a detailed description of these additional outcome measures and results).</p><p id="Par54">In sum, we observed no indication that MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP increased weight loss or that it improved related motivational constructs, as effect sizes fell below the minimum threshold for a small effect. Together with previous null findings, our results suggest that, at best, MI is not consistently effective in improving weight-loss outcomes in BWLPs. Research to date &#x02013; including the&#x000a0;present null findings &#x02013; could prove informative for devising future investigations seeking to enhance weight loss in BWLPs. With the aim of improving future randomized controlled trials for MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP, we now&#x000a0;highlight important lessons learned in the present trial.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Lesson 1: use a stepped-care approach</title><p id="Par55">In stepped-care models, additional treatment sessions are provided to those who need them. We administered MI in a standard fashion to participants, using a predetermined MI protocol, and did not tailor the components of MI to match each participant&#x02019;s level of readiness to change. Contrary to our expectations, participants receiving MI did not report greater importance of change, readiness for change, or confidence for change following each MI session than control participants, suggesting no discernible effect of MI on these measures of motivation. Notably, as all three ratings were high at baseline (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) we may have encountered a ceiling effect. Assessment of these specific aspects of motivation at baseline and throughout treatment could have been used to help guide a stepped-care approach to treatment. Perhaps if we had followed Miller and Rollnick&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggestion to adapt MI to the client&#x02019;s stage of readiness to change, we would have increased the effectiveness of the MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP. For example, Carels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] used a stepped-care approach in which they identified individuals who had failed to meet weight-loss goals during the course of a BWLP and administered additional 45- to 60-min individual sessions until weight-loss goals were achieved. This approach was successful: the MI group lost more weight and increased planned physical activity more than a control group with no additional treatment. It is likely that selecting those individuals most likely to benefit from motivational enhancement and adapting treatment dose to meet these clients&#x02019; needs contributed to effective outcomes in this study.</p><p id="Par56">In addition, if administered over the follow-up period, we speculate that MI might help individuals to maintain changes at a point when motivation might be more likely to wane. Future research might investigate whether such an approach improves weight-loss maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Lesson 2: assess pretreatment motivation to determine MI necessity for the sample</title><p id="Par57">It is important to focus on assessing differences in motivation for the sample of interest prior to conducting MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP research. Recently, attention has been directed to specific elements of methodological quality in clinical trials, such as the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Rather than assume universal impact of behavioral interventions, such as MI, on weight loss, it is preferable to determine the need for tailoring of interventions to specific populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For example, although in prior MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP research the BWLP was provided at no cost to participants; participants in the present study had sufficient motivation prior to treatment to have paid to participate in the BWLP. Given that MI may be differentially effective depending on one&#x02019;s initial motivation to change, stand-alone BWLPs may be sufficient for individuals with higher initial levels of motivation without the addition of MI. However, many individuals with obesity in the community who might benefit from a BWLP may not have the pretreatment motivational levels to seek out these effective programs. An alternative strategy would be to use MI to target the motivation of these individuals to initially attend a BWLP. Overall, comprehensive assessment of a sample&#x02019;s pretreatment motivation for change appears to be important in future research. Assessing a sample&#x02019;s pretreatment motivation may assist with further refining our understanding of whom in particular may benefit from MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Lesson 3: refine the definition of the motivation construct &#x02013; consider assessing both controlled and autonomous motivation</title><p id="Par58">There has been increasing interest in the application of Self-determination Theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] to MI as a means to better operationalize the construct of motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Applications of this theory propose that there is an important distinction between a client&#x02019;s level of <italic>controlled</italic> (i.e., extrinsic) versus <italic>autonomous</italic> (i.e., intrinsic) motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It is suggested that greater autonomous motivation is associated with greater odds of success for behavioral change, whereas controlled motivation is associated with lower odds of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Consequently, MI may be best suited for individuals with high controlled motivation and less suitable for those with high autonomous motivation (e.g., those who choose to enroll in a weight-loss program for personal reasons and do not feel compelled by external factors to lose weight). For example, in a study that failed to find a benefit of adding MI to a BWLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], post hoc analyses found that the effect of MI on weight-loss outcomes was moderated by level of baseline controlled motivation. Specifically, among individuals with high controlled motivation, the MI group experienced greater weight loss than the control group. Several recent studies have used SDT and assessment of autonomous and controlled motivation as a core tenet of weight-loss interventions with promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and currently components of SDT are being integrated with MI to develop a tailored intervention related to the promotion of physical activity (e.g., Moreau et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). Thus, distinguishing controlled and autonomous motivation in assessment in MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP studies may help refine the conceptualization of the construct of motivation and better guide MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par59">This MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP study had several strengths. Specifically, we assessed fidelity, incorporated an attention control group, and included a longer-term follow-up. Our sample size was large, we included both women and men, and we did not limit recruitment to individuals with a specific medical concern. Additionally, we assessed dimensions theoretically related to motivation for change and used a sophisticated statistical procedure to handle missing data.</p><p id="Par60">However, this study also had several limitations. First, given our participants&#x02019; high baseline self-reported ratings of importance, readiness, and confidence for change, we speculate that they may have already been high in autonomous motivation prior to treatment. Therefore, this sample may not have been well-suited to benefit from the addition of MI to a BWLP. Second, the MI dose provided in this study may have been inadequate to improve weight-loss outcomes. Compared to the average dosage in MI for weight-loss research, in hindsight the MI intervention we provided was minimal. The analysis by Armstrong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] showed that, of studies that had investigated an effect on weight of MI in conjunction with a BWLP, those that demonstrated a significant effect of MI had offered five or more sessions. The fact that the present study included only two sessions of MI influences the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the efficacy of MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP for weight loss. Third, we relied on self-report outcome data for the exploratory outcome measures (i.e., change ratings), which may be subject to self-reporting biases. Fourth, the sample was composed largely of White, higher-socioeconomic-status individuals, which limits the generalizability of findings to other populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">Although MI may have promise in the treatment of obesity, further research to isolate specific elements and patient characteristics that contribute to improved MI outcomes is essential. We encourage future investigators to: (1) assess motivation throughout treatment to enable provision of a stepped-care approach, (2) assess pretreatment motivation to determine whether MI is appropriate for the population of interest, and (3) refine assessment of the motivation construct to include assessments of both controlled and autonomous motivation, before and throughout treatment. Carefully controlled trials that incorporate recommendations of the ORBIT model in their design are needed to advance knowledge about maximizing efficacy of weight loss. For example, refining MI&#x02009;+&#x02009;BWLP treatments by developing &#x0201c;adaptive treatments with tailoring for special population subgroups or for differential response to treatment&#x0201d; [45; p. 976] is needed. It is not yet clear what minimum dose of MI is needed to improve BWLP outcomes, but dose may need to vary according to sample, individual characteristics, and ongoing assessment of motivation. Continued efforts targeted towards careful, methodological improvement of existing interventions, such as MI+ BWLP, and development of new forms of treatment remain important goals for effective obesity treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec36"><p>
