Thirty patients with acute diarrhea were fed twice-daily 15 ml/kg of Apple Juice (AJ), 30 received White Grape Juice (WGJ), and 30 were given colored and flavored water (WA) as part of their age appropriate dietary intake. The duration and severity of diarrhea were the main endpoint variables of the study performed in a metabolic unit. The patients were similar among the 3 groups, had diarrhea for 50&#x02013;64 hours prior to admission, and were dehydrated when admitted to the unit for study. Half of the patients in each group were well nourished and the others had mild to moderate degrees of malnutrition. Rotavirus infection was the agent causing the illness in 63% of the patients. The infants fed juice ingested 14&#x02013;17% more calories than those given WA, (those receiving AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 Calories/Kg/d respectively) whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 cal/kg/d). The increased energy intake was not at the expense of other foods or milk formula. The mean body weight gain was greater among patients receiving WGJ (+ 50.7 gm) as compared with the patients in the AJ group (+ 18.3 gm) or the patients fed WA (- 0.7 gm) (p = 0.08). The duration of the illness was longer in the infants fed juice as compared with those given WA (p = 0.006), the mean +/- SD duration in hours was 49.4 &#x000b1; 32.6, 47.5 &#x000b1; 38.9 and 26.5 &#x000b1; 27.4 in patients fed AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. All patients improved while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea; most recovered within 50 hours of the beginning of treatment and less than one fourth had diarrhea longer than 96 hours in the unit. The fecal losses were also increased among the juice fed patients (p = 0.001); the mean &#x000b1; SD fecal excretion in g/kg/h was 3.94 &#x000b1; 2.35, 3.59 &#x000b1; 2.35, and 2.19 &#x000b1; 1.63 in AJ, WGJ and WA respectively. The stool output was highest during the first day of treatment among all the patients, though those fed AJ had the highest volume of fecal losses and those who received WA had the lowest stool excretion. After the first day of treatment the differences in fecal excretion were not significant. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates during the illness and immediately after recovery was similar among the 3 groups of patients. Intake of juices with different fructose/glucose ratios and osmolarities resulted in more fecal losses and more prolonged diarrhea as compared with water feedings, but the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly among those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Worldwide, acute diarrhea represents one of the leading causes of death in children less than 5 years of age. The average duration of an acute episode of this illness is 5 days, but in some cases the diarrhea may persist more than 14 days. This leads to deterioration of the nutritional status and of the prognosis of the disease. Whereas 0.7% of acute diarrhea cases may be fatal, mortality may be 10 to 35% in the persistent diarrhea patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that proper management of hydration and appropriate dietary intake during the illness can decrease the stool output, reduce the risk of prolonged diarrhea, and improve the nutritional status of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended home fluids, including fruit juices, as appropriate feedings and as a measure to improve fluid balance during acute diarrheal episodes in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the other hand the Provisional Committee on Quality Improvement, Sub-committee on Acute Gastroenteritis and the Committee On Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that the management of diarrheal disease in young children should include early feedings of age appropriate foods, while avoiding foods high in fat and feedings with simple sugars, including teas, juices and soft drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. ESPGHAN's working group on acute diarrhea endorsed similar recommendations. They recommended the use of a normal diet without restrictions, including lactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, the recommendations for or against juice feedings during acute diarrhea have not been prospectively assessed. Previous data showed that not all fruit juices are equally absorbed. Some juices, like pear (PJ) and apple juice (AJ), which contain more fructose than glucose and sorbitol, are poorly absorbed as compared with white grape juice (WGJ) which contains equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose, without sorbitol. We recently demonstrated that children challenged with a single serving of PJ or AJ during the recovery phase of diarrhea presented recurrence of loose stools, whereas those who received WGJ did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In other reports it has been shown that apple juice ingestion may be associated with chronic diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In this double blind randomized clinical trial we measured the effects of juice intake during acute diarrheal illness. AJ, WGJ, and water feedings were given twice daily as part of an age appropriate dietary intake. While feedings of juice increased the stool loses and the duration of diarrhea, juice intake also contributed to a higher energy intake and increased weight gain, particularly among those fed the juice containing equimolar quantities of fructose and glucose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted in a double-blind design. There were 90 infants with severe diarrhea admitted to the Fima Lifshitz Metabolic Unit at The University Hospital Professor Edgar Santos, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Thirty patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive one of three juice feedings: apple juice (AJ), white grape juice (WGJ) or water (WA). The composition of each one of them is shown in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. These were packaged by the manufacturer (Welch's in Concord MA) in identical bottles and were of the same appearance and color. The WA was colored and flavored to resemble juice. Thirty identically labeled bottles containing 300 ml each were provided per patient. A new bottle was opened for each of the twice daily feedings. The investigators involved with the care of the patients in the study were not aware of the code identifying the bottle content or of the type of juice that the infant was randomized to be fed. To establish the randomization list, permuted blocks of variable length, with four blocks for each group, were used in order to avoid imbalance between treatment groups.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Carbohydrate Content of Fruit Juices</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Juice</td><td align="center">Osmolality mOsm/L</td><td align="center">Fructose gm/dl</td><td align="center">Glucose gm/dl</td><td align="center">Sucrose gm/dl</td><td align="center">Sorbitol gm/dl</td><td align="center">Energy cal/dl</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Apple</td><td align="center">700</td><td align="center">6.2</td><td align="center">2.7</td><td align="center">1.2</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">40.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">White Grape</td><td align="center">1040</td><td align="center">7.5</td><td align="center">7.1</td><td align="center">0.0</td><td align="center">0.0</td><td align="center">58.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Water<sup>x</sup></td><td align="center">46</td><td align="center">--</td><td align="center">--</td><td align="center">--</td><td align="center">--</td><td align="center">--</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Modified from:</p><p>Hyams JS, Etienne NL, Leichtner AM, Theuer RC, Carbohydrate malabsorption following fruit juice ingestion in young children.

Patients presenting severe dehydration or other conditions or concurrent serious illness, and history of chronic diarrhea as well as those exclusively breast fed prior to the time of the illness were excluded from the study. An informed consent was elicited from the mothers of all patients admitted into the protocol. The study was approved by the Institutional review Board of the Hospital and of the University.</p><p>The patients were hydrated according WHO guidelines. They were treated with ORS given at a dose of 100 ml/kg over 6 hr. The maintenance hydration phase started once the acute dehydration was treated. This was continued throughout the duration of the illness. During this phase the patients received ORS solution on a volume to weight replacement of ongoing stool loses and vomit. After rehydration was achieved, the infants were started on their usual diet that consisted of age appropriate milk formula and feedings and complementary foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additionally, all infants received a serving of 15 ml/kg of AJ, WGJ, or WA, twice daily (10 AM and 3 PM) throughout the diarrheal episode. Plain water was offered "ad libitum" between meals. Lactose free formula was utilized in two patients who had severe stool losses &#x0003e;10 ml/kg/hr during their milk formula feedings.</p><p>A Breath Hydrogen Test (BH2) was performed twenty-four hours after the illness improved, defined as two formed stools passed during 24 hrs., or no stools for 12 hrs. The patients were fasted for 6 hours and a juice feeding was given. Breath Hydrogen levels were measured every 30 minutes for 3 hours using a SC Microanalyzer (Quintron Instruments Co). A peak rise in H2 of at least 20 ppm was considered as a positive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Body weight was measured on admission, after rehydration, and daily thereafter until discharge. Nutritional assessment was determined using weigh-for-length with National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data as reference. Nutritional intake and the amount of fluids ingested were measured throughout the study. Stool weight, Urine volume, and Vomitus weight were quantitated using metabolic techniques and specially designed beds to accurately collect stool loses throughout the study. Breast milk intake was estimated by weighing the patients before and after breastfeeding. All stools were tested for pH and sugars by Clinitest tablets. Standard laboratory techniques were used for measurement of serum sodium, potassium and hemoglobin and hematocrit on admission, at 24 hours after the initiation of the study and as clinically indicated afterwards. Stool cultures for pathogens and rotavirus by ELISA were performed on admission. All patients were requested to return after one week for outpatient clinic follow-up. At this visit clinical evolution of each patient was recorded.</p><p>The following endpoint variables were quantified: duration of the illness, severity of diarrhea (assessed by the number, type and consistency of the stools) and the amounts of fecal loses measured as g/kg/day. Vomitus losses were also quantitated. The amount of fluid intake required to maintain fluid balance was also determined. Body weight changes were measured utilizing the weight of the patient attained after rehydration as compared with the one prior to discharge. The presence of carbohydrate intolerance was determined by the fecal pH and sugar excretion as well as by the breath hydrogen levels after juice intake.</p><p>The sample size was calculated by the Power program to ensure statistically significant differences on the stool output and duration of diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The estimated sample size was 26 patients per group assuming a 30% clinical improvement, on the above outcomes, at a power of 80% at 0.05 significance. Data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), when data distribution was not normal, a non-parametric test of Kruskal-Wallis were performed. Survival curves Kaplan-Meyers were used when appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The clinical characteristics and the laboratory data of the patients on admission are shown in tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. The patients in each of the 3 groups were similar in age, duration and severity of diarrhea, presence of fever and vomiting. Also there were no differences in the proportion of patients who received breast feedings or in their nutritional status. Over 46% of patients studied in each group, were well nourished, more than 33% showed mild body weight deficits (&#x0003c;1 SD) and the others had mild to moderate malnutrition (&#x0003e;2 SD).

The covariance analysis and the robust regression showed a possible influence of ORS intake in the differences detected among the 3 groups of patients. The stool output was not different when the ORS intake was adjusted for the 3 groups of patients and the urinary outputs were also similar. Vomitus losses were not different among the 3 groups of patients, vomiting being present primarily during the first 24 hrs. of treatment.</p><p>There were 2 patients who had severe diarrhea during the treatment period (&#x0003e;10 ml/kg/hr). These patients were in the AJ group, one of these patients had acid stools and none had carbohydrates in feces. These 2 patients were treated with a lactose free formula, with improvement in stool output. There were three other patients who showed carbohydrate intolerance with acid stools or sugars in feces among the 3 groups, they improved without any dietary modifications.</p><p>Vomiting was present in all groups of patients: 22 (AJ), 26 (WGJ), and 19 (WA) during the first day of treatment; nevertheless this did not represented a limitation for Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) or feeding regimen and no patient was withdrawn or shifted to another therapy due to vomiting.</p><p>The response to juice feedings, as determined by breath hydrogen excretion after improvement of the illness, was not different among the 3 groups of patients. Most infants did not show breath hydrogen excretion levels above 20 ppm; and there were 17, 16 and 10 patients among the AJ, WGJ and WA groups respectively, who failed to show BH2 levels above 5 ppm at any time. Only 18 patients demonstrated a delta BH2 level increase above the basal value of more than 20 ppm. Eight of them were given AJ, 6 were fed WGJ and 4 received WA. There were 11, 16, and 13 patients in each group who exhibited a BH2 value above 20 ppm independent of the delta differences from basal among the WGJ, AJ and WA fed groups respectively. The differences in BH2 levels among groups were not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first double blind prospective study designed to evaluate the effects of fruit juice feedings during diarrheal disease in young children. Two commonly available juices were selected and compared with water intake, as part of an age appropriate dietary intake. One juice contained equimolar quantities of glucose and fructose (WGJ) and the other one provided a higher fructose to glucose ratio and contained sorbitol (AJ). All patients improved while being fed water or any of these 2 juices. However those receiving juice had more stool losses than those fed water, highest being among the patients fed AJ. This was a significant finding during the first day of treatment, not thereafter. On the other hand the children fed juice ingested more calories and gained more weight than those fed water, those fed WGJ having the best response.</p><p>Acute gastroenteritis continues to be a common illness among infants and children worldwide. The disease causes an estimated 2 million deaths annually among children in the developing world. In the United States diarrhea accounts for more than 1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations and 300 deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Children younger than 5 years of age are at much higher risk of death from diarrhea than older children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Infants younger than one year of age are particularly susceptible to this disease and are at the highest risk of death, 43% to 78% of mortalities from the illness among children less than 5 years of age occur in infants less than one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although the number of children currently dying from diarrhea continues to be unacceptably high, it is substantially lower than the 5 million deaths estimated 20 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The critical factors accounting for the reduction in mortality rates from this illness include widespread use of oral hydration solutions and the proper nutritional rehabilitation of sick infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has emphasized the importance of oral hydration and early nutritional support to aid these patients safely and effectively through the diarrheal episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A rapid realimentation with age appropriated foods and an unrestricted diet is recommended, as soon as dehydration is corrected. Nursing should be continued for those infants being breast fed and a standard full strength formula to be given to those formula fed children. The old concept of "Bowel Rest" has no scientific validity and it can serve to aggravate and increase the risks of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Apart from the undesirable metabolic effects of even brief fasts, withholding oral intake may further compound the intestinal absorptive processes and may lead to deterioration of the nutritional status of the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Even though feedings increase the stool output and diarrhea, children who are fed attain higher body weights at the end of the illness than children who are not fed. This was evident in this study. Patients who were fed juice as part of the nutritional intake during the diarrheal illness had a higher body weight at recovery than those fed water, although they exhibited larger stool losses during the first 24 hours of nutritional rehabilitation.</p><p>Diarrhea, like other infections, decreases the appetite and sick infants often reject most foods, although breast milk is better accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The lack of appetite may be mediated by interleukin 1, a hormone released by the white cells after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The intensity of anorexia may not necessarily correlate with the severity of the illness. A child may lose his or her appetite with even mild diarrhea, with anorexia lasting from a few hours to several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As much as 20% to 70% of food available may be wasted or not eaten, during bouts of diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus feedings of a well accepted available energy source might be desirable and necessary to enhance the nutrient intake of sick infants and young children. The patients in this study readily consumed fruit juice, and the intake of this food did not displace the consumption of other nutrients. Juice feedings resulted in a higher energy balance, particularly among the infants fed WGJ. Infants fed juice ingested 14&#x02013;17% more calories than those given WA, AJ and WGJ ingested 95 and 98 calories/kg/d respectively, whereas those receiving WA consumed 81 calories/kg/d.</p><p>Previous data showed that fruit juices differ in carbohydrate composition and that juices containing equimolar concentrations of glucose and fructose were best absorbed throughout the first 5 years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Similarly we have previously shown that this type of juice is better tolerated after recovery from acute diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The present study confirmed that this juice was better suited during the acute stages of the illness. The fecal losses associated with consumption of WGJ juice during the treatment of acute diarrhea were lower than those observed during feedings of juice containing higher fructose to glucose ratios and sorbitol. However, the stool output was highest only during the first day of treatment, with differences in stool output rapidly disappearing with recovery from the illness. All patients improved within 3&#x02013;4 days while ingesting juice and none of them developed persistent diarrhea. The ability to tolerate carbohydrates was also similar among the 3 groups of patients.</p><p>The patients were given ad libitum up to 15 ml/kg/dose of juice twice daily throughout the study. This dose of juice exceeded the recommended allowance by the AAP-CON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] which limits the intake of juice to one serving of 4&#x02013;6 oz per day to children of this age. However by allowing the patients to ingest at will the high energy drink during the illness, they did not consume the full amount of juice offered, they only ingested approximately 17 to 21 ml/kg/day, those receiving WA consuming the lesser amounts. The patients given juice feedings also ingested more fluids. One can speculate that fluid intake was higher due to fecal losses replacement and/or thirst induced by juice. A covariance analysis and a robust regression to determine a possible confounding factor did not support that possibility. No differences were found among groups by adjusting the stool output to ORS or fluid intake. However, the ORS volume represented the most important fluid intake, indicating that diarrhea duration and stool losses were the consequence of this finding.</p><p>The maintenance of a positive energy balance during the illness may be of particular importance for the vulnerable infant who is at a higher nutritional risk even before developing diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This illness is considered to be one of the most important risks for the development of malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Diarrhea and other infections affect the body's economy through a number of mechanisms including the decreased absorption of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The provision of simple carbohydrates in a balanced proportion, as present in some juices, may facilitate energy balance even during the illness and may be positive for the infant's nutritional rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The ingestion of juice during the acute episode of diarrhea provided a higher average energy intake than that of those fed WA (+ 12 cal/kg/day for AJ and 18 cal/kg/day for WGJ). However ingestion of larger amounts of fruit juice has been associated with prolongation of diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally ingestion of juices containing high fructose and sorbitol may also be associated with other negative consequences, i.e. colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and increased energy requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The transient malabsorption during the acute phase of the illness may be overcome by absorptive advantages of the carbohydrate composition of specific feedings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similar results were found with amino-acid based ORS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and with the low-osmolality ORS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], though there was a negative role of high osmolality solutions. However the most important therapy for the sick infant is the rapid rehydration, the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance and the provision of adequate feedings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Feedings of juices with different fructose/glucose ratio, with or without sorbitol and osmolality levels resulted in more fecal losses in the first 24 hours of diarrhea as compared with water feedings. However the patients given juice ingested more calories and gained more weight, particularly those being fed the juice with equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose without sorbitol. All patients recovered with appropriate treatment without anyone developing persistent diarrhea. Our data strongly support the present recommendation of maintaining normal dietary habits during acute diarrheal episodes. However, juice choices may vary in its effect, as they vary in their composition; thus these differences should be considered when recommendations are made for feeding sick infants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported in part by Welch's Inc. and Pediatric Sunshine Academics Inc.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization</collab></person-group><article-title>Programme for the control of diarrheal diseases</article-title><source>A manual for the treatment of diarrhoea Ver 2</source><year>1990</year><publisher-name>Washignton (DC): WHO/CDD/SER/80</publisher-name></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Gastanaduy</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of continued oral feeding on clinical and nutritional out-comes of acute diarrhea in children</article-title><source>J Pediatr</source><year>1998</year><volume>112</volume><fpage>191</fpage><lpage>200</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3339500</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>The Working Center Group on Acute Diarrheoa of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.
