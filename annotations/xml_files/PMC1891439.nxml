Today the vast burden of disease is encountered in the developing world where sanitary conditions remain poor. The best global estimates are of at least 22 million cases of typhoid fever each year with 200,000 deaths <xref rid="pone.0000542-Crump1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Crucially these are almost exclusively confined to resource poor countries. A recent Cochrane review <xref rid="pone.0000542-Thaver1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> on typhoid treatments underscored the need for large sample size drug interventional trials, especially in children in whom this disease predominates.</p><p>In 1948 the introduction of chloramphenicol revolutionized the treatment of typhoid fever <xref rid="pone.0000542-Woodward1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000542-Basnyat1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Unfortunately the emergence of resistance to the &#x0201c;first line&#x0201d; antimicrobials (for example, ciprofloxacin) has been a major setback and has given rise to the possibility of untreatable enteric fever <xref rid="pone.0000542-Threlfall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000542-Basnyat2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Gatifloxacin, a relatively inexpensive fluoroquinolone antibiotic in South Asia with once daily oral administration, is a new broad spectrum synthetic 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone which has the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against S. typhi from Nepal <xref rid="pone.0000542-Maskey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This in vitro activity needs to be verified clinically before gatifloxacin can be recommended for widespread use. Cefixime, an orally administered third generation cephalosporin, is a commonly used drug in South Asia for the treatment of enteric fever. Although cefixime is recommended as a drug of choice by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of resistant typhoid fever <xref rid="pone.0000542-Communicable1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> it is relatively expensive in South Asia and has to be administered for a longer duration than the currently used fluoroquinolones. Clearly there is an urgent need for a treatment <xref rid="pone.0000542-Pandit1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> that combines ease of oral administration, with speed of clinical response, reduction in secondary transmission and inexpensiveness. In this open randomized trial, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever with gatifloxacin or cefixime in an outpatient setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was approved by Nepal Health Research Council and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000542.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000542.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. We enrolled patients who presented to the outpatient or emergency department of Patan Hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal from June 5, 2005 to September 8, 2005. Patan Hospital is a 318 &#x02013;bed hospital located in the Lalitpur district in Kathmandu Valley. Patients were eligible to enter the study if they had clinically diagnosed enteric fever and their residence was within approximately 2.5 km radius from the hospital. Other inclusion criteria were that patients must be aged between 2 and 65 years, able to take oral medications, non-pregnant and non-lactating, without a history of seizures, able to stay in the city for the duration of the treatment, not known to have contraindications to either cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones and willing to give informed written consent to take part in the study. For children enrolled into the study, written informed consent was taken from a parent. Patients were excluded from the study if they had any signs of complicated typhoid defined as the presence of jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonism, shock, encephalopathy, convulsions, myocarditis or arrythmia at the time of enrollment. Patients who had received a third generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone or macrolide in the week prior to presentation to our clinic were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Interventions</title><p>On presentation to Patan Hospital all patients with fever without an obvious focus were referred to the enteric fever study clinic, where they were seen by the study physician. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive Gatifloxacin (Broadband&#x02122;, Novartis AG Basel, Switzerland) 10 mg/kg/day <xref rid="pone.0000542-Capparelli1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, in a single dose orally for 7 days or Cefixime (Cifex&#x02122;, Aegis, Nicosia, Cyprus) 20 mg/kg/day <xref rid="pone.0000542-Richens1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> in two divided doses orally for 7 days. Both drugs were administered in tablet form, cut and weighed in a sensitive scale to ensure that underdosing did not occur. To children who were apprehensive of swallowing the tablet, the drug was embedded in a banana and given. All patients were asked to swallow the study drug under direct observation during each visit.</p><p>Each patient had haematocrit, total leucocyte count with differential, serum creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotranferase(ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) measured, and blood and stool cultures were also performed before the start of the study intervention.</p><p>The exact location of the patient's home was recorded and the first dose of drug administered at the clinic. We employed six Community Medical Auxiliaries (CMA) who had all received at least 15 months of prior formal primary health care worker training and been registered in a government recognized institution. The CMAs visited patients twice daily at their homes to perform a simple clinical assessment, measure the oral temperature and give directly observed therapy with the study drugs. The CMA visited the patient's home every 12 hours, morning and evening, until day 10 following enrollment or complete resolution of illness, whichever came later. The oral temperature of the patient was recorded twice every day by the CMA and a note was made of the timing and dosages of acetaminophen intake. The quality of patient-visits was ensured by regular unplanned supervisory checks in which the study doctor accompanied the CMA during the visits to patients' homes</p><p>CMAs were asked to send patients immediately to the hospital on encountering any severe symptoms, and the patients also were asked to attend clinic if they had any severe symptoms at any other time. A symptom questionnaire was used daily during each visit to monitor any adverse events. Any patient with any severe symptom was seen by the study physician. The CMAs and study physicians held daily case conferences at which all the study patients were discussed.</p><p>All patients regardless of the culture results were seen at hospital on Day 10 following enrollment. Blood and stool cultures were repeated on Day 10 in all culture positive patients and thereafter if the patient again became ill with probable enteric fever. All culture positive patients were followed up until six months after enrollment, and stool cultures were performed at the end of the first, third and sixth month.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Microbiological Procedures</title><p>Blood culture was performed on media containing tryptone soya broth and sodium polyethanol sulphonate, incubated at 37 C and examined daily for growth over 7 days <xref rid="pone.0000542-Pandit1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A, B or C isolated in culture were identified using standard biochemical tests and specific antisera (Murex Biotech, Dartford, England). Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined during isolation using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method involving antibiotic discs containing Nalidixic acid, Ofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Cefixime and Cefotaxime (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined later for organisms stored in glycerol (bacterial preserver) at -70C. The MICs were determined by Chloramphenicol, Nalidixic acid, Gatifloxacin, Cefixime, Ceftriaxone and Gemifloxacin E-tests&#x02122; (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensitivity tests were interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria for Enterobacteriaceae.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of Gatifloxacin and Cefixime in the treatment of uncomplicated culture positive enteric fever.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the fever clearance time (FCT). FCT was defined as time to first drop in oral temperature &#x02264; 37.5&#x000b0;C, remaining &#x02264; 37.5&#x000b0;C for 48 hours. The secondary outcomes included acute treatment failure. Acute treatment failure was defined as including any severe complication; the persistence of fever (&#x0003e; 38 C); the persistence of symptoms for more than 7 days after the start of treatment , requiring additional or rescue treatment. If a patient had a temperature above 37.5 and below 38 for more than 7 days, but did not need additional or rescue therapy, and subsequently their fever cleared by day 10, that patient would not qualify as an acute treatment failure. Patients who failed the study treatment were given rescue treatment.</p><p>The rescue drug was Ofloxacin 20 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses for 14 days for the Cefixime group, and Ceftriaxone 40 mg/kg/day IV in a single daily dose for 14 days for the Gatifloxacin group. For the Cefixime group alone, if on day 8 of treatment the patient still had a fever of &#x0003e;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;38&#x000b0;C, the study drug was continued for 10 days and the patient categorized as acute treatment failure. If the temperature on Day 10 was &#x0003e;37.5, rescue treatment was given.</p><p>A relapse was defined as fever with a positive blood culture within a month of completing treatment. All the relapses were patients that were initially categorized as successfully treated. Any patient given rescue treatment or prolonged treatment was precluded from the &#x0201c;relapse&#x0201d; group.</p><p>Patients categorized as &#x0201c;overall treatment failures&#x0201d; included patients experiencing acute treatment failure, plus those falling into the relapsed category, plus all deaths within the trial follow up period.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated to detect a FCT difference of approximately 48 hours between gatifloxacin (assumed median FCT 156 hrs) and cefixime (assumed median FCT 204 hrs) <xref rid="pone.0000542-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> with p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 and power&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;80&#x00025;. The accrual time for recruitment was assumed to last 70 days, and that the last patient would be followed up until 8 days after recruitment. Therefore, we estimated the minimum sample size at 235 participants. Assuming a loss to follow-up of 5&#x00025;, the sample size was calculated as 125 blood culture positive patients in each arm.</p><p>Before the recommended sample size had been reached, once 169 blood culture positive patients had been enrolled, the independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) advised the Principal Investigators to stop recruitment to the trial based on a priori defined difference (p&#x0003c;0.01) between the two treatment arms in the primary endpoints of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Sequence generation</title><p>Patients were randomized in blocks of 100 from a computer generated randomization list, by an investigator not involved in patient recruitment or assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Allocation concealment</title><p>The randomization sequence and block size was concealed from the physicians allocating treatment and managing the patients, prior to patient enrollment.

In patients with fever, a very common clinical diagnosis is enteric fever, and <italic>S. enterica</italic> serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A are the two most commonly isolated pathogens from the blood in febrile patients in our hospital <xref rid="pone.0000542-Murdoch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Before the advent of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) <italic>S.</italic> Typhi, chloramphenicol, ampicillin or cotrimoxazole were successfully used as the first line drug in the treatment of enteric fever. After the emergence of MDR strains, fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been suggested and used as alternative antimicrobials <xref rid="pone.0000542-Cammie1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000542-Richens1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However the emergence and spread of point mutations in the <italic>gyrA</italic> gene of the bacterial genome <xref rid="pone.0000542-Shirakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> has conferred resistance to nalidixic acid and reduced susceptibility to the commonly used fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin, leading to a poorer clinical response <xref rid="pone.0000542-Chinh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000542-Ansari1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A recent study in Viet Nam (CM Parry, unpublished) showed ofloxacin at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day was able to achieve a cure rate in only 64&#x00025; of patients. In our context of high nalidixic acid resistance, gatifloxacin is the most effective and appropriate choice for treatment of enteric fever. Gatifloxacin (Sandoz, India) is relatively inexpensive (US$1.2 for a 7 day treatment course) and needs to be administered just once a day; both of these features are attractive in this setting. Gatifloxacin has a different binding motif than some other fluroquinolones<xref rid="pone.0000542-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and this characteristic enables it to retain activity against <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi or <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Paratyphi A even in the presence of marked reduction in sensitivity to the older fluoroquinolones <xref rid="pone.0000542-Shirakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, is widely trusted to be effective for enteric fever as first line treatment, and is also used as second line therapy when initial treatment with a fluoroquinolone in a patient suspected to be enteric fever fails <xref rid="pone.0000542-Richens1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The fact that we saw a high overall failure rate associated with cefixime despite all of the strains being fully sensitive in vitro to the drug shows that the mechanism of action of cefixime <xref rid="pone.0000542-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000542-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> may not be suited to the eradication of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi or Paratyphi A from the body or blood, and the poor intracellular penetration into macrophages and reticulo endothelial tissues where the typhoid organisms colonize <xref rid="pone.0000542-Cammie1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> may be the cause of high failure rates.</p><p>This study was unique in that we used CMAs to simulate a hospital setup in the community. CMA's directly observed patients taking the therapies, monitored fever and identified complications early; these characteristics have not been used in the past for typhoid trials although enteric fever in endemic areas <xref rid="pone.0000542-Parry1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> is treated on an outpatient basis. A major advantage of follow-up using CMAs was that the health workers knew the exact house location of the patients, and therefore follow up even after the successful completion of the initial seven-day drug trial was possible. In developing countries follow up of patients can be very difficult because of a lack of a proper address and relative unavailability of other means of communication, for example,a telephone.</p><p>In addition to its relevance to culture confirmed enteric fever, another major strength of this large randomized study is that gatifloxacin proved to be more efficacious than cefixime with respect to fever clearance time and failure rates, even in the subgroup of patients who were clinically presumed to have enteric fever but who had a negative blood culture. Antibiotic treatment for typhoid in highly endemic areas is usually started based on the presence of a &#x0201c;syndromic&#x0201d; illness (acute fever for a few days and constitutional symptoms with no known source of infection) before culture results are known. Enteric fever, which continues to be a neglected disease <xref rid="pone.0000542-Parry2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and facilities for blood culture or other reliable methods of diagnosis rarely exist in this setting.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Despite widespread resistance to Nalidixic acid in Kathmandu, and rising MICs to the older fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, gatifloxacin has proven to be a potent drug for the treatment of enteric fever. Our study has relevance to South Asia, as resistance to nalidixic acid is widely prevalent there. Inevitably there will be emergence of resistance to gatifloxacin in areas with both MDR and NARST; and in this situation alternative antibiotics like azithromycin may need to be used. Of interest, in keeping with anecdotal reports from elsewhere in South Asia, only one strain was resistant to chloramphenicol in the present study. In areas of the world where chloramphenicol susceptibility has reemerged there may be an argument for reassessing chloramphenicol.</p><p>In the present study Gatifloxacin was associated with nausea in 12&#x00025; of patients and it may be important to forewarn patients of this possible side effect. There have been sporadic reports of dysglycemia caused by gatifloxacin <xref rid="pone.0000542-Khovidhunit1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000542-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and a recent population-based, case controlled study examining gatifloxacin usage amongst elderly individuals in Canada (mean age 77 years) who developed dysglycemia <xref rid="pone.0000542-ParkWyllie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> also raises possible concerns. We did not do any blood sugar testing to look for dysglycemia. However in a study involving a younger age group where blood sugar testing was done the results revealed no dysglycemia: 887 children were treated with gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg) for otitis media and were followed for a year with no signs of alteration of glucose homeostasis either acutely or otherwise <xref rid="pone.0000542-Pichichero1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Clearly, it would be prudent to treat diabetics and elderly people suffering from enteric fever with an alternative antibiotic such as azithromycin and avoid the potential problems in this specific population with gatifloxacin.</p><sec id="s4b1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The DSMC advised the Principal Investigators in this study to stop recruitment to the trial based on a priori defined difference (p&#x0003c;0.01) between the two treatment arms in the primary endpoints of the study. It is possible that if the trial had been continued with a larger sample size, other important information could have been gathered. In addition if patients and/or investigators had been blinded to treatment assignments, the study would have been further strengthened; however as in most typhoid trials, it was not possible to do this due to the difference in dosing schedule for the two drugs being compared. Another limitation of this study was that temperature was only measured every 12 hours. However, to address this limitation, and to avoid missing increases in temperature, we checked temperatures for 10 days after enrollment, or for 48 hours after resolution of fever, whichever came later, in all patients. Finally, a telephone or internet based system of randomization would be ideal, but such a system does not exist here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>We have compared the outcomes from our trial with those of other comparable studies, identified from a recent Cochrane review <xref rid="pone.0000542-Thaver1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, WHO typhoid guidelines <xref rid="pone.0000542-Communicable1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and a search of Medline using these terms: cefixime, typhoid trials. The findings in our study are consistent with those of a 1995 study done in Viet Nam which showed that cefixime (20 mg/kg/day) for 7 days was inferior to ofloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 days in the treatment of MDR typhoid fever in children<xref rid="pone.0000542-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However other studies have suggested cefixime can be successful in the treatment of enteric fever <xref rid="pone.0000542-Rabbani1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000542-Bhutta1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Overall these studies, both descriptive and randomized, have examining the use of cefixime in confirmed enteric fever (total of 292 patients) and with treatment durations of mostly 14 days, have found failure rates ranging from 4&#x00025; to 23&#x00025;. Besides the general undesirability of a longer course with cefixime with increased morbidity and possibly complications, this drug is also more expensive (a 7-day course costs US $7 (Blue Cross Laboratories, India)). The present study is the largest randomized controlled trial ever conducted with cefixime in enteric fever and clearly shows, even in a setting with fully sensitive strains, that cefixime is a poor drug for this disease. These findings are contrary to the recommendation by many sources<xref rid="pone.0000542-Richens1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000542-Parry1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> including the World Health Organization<xref rid="pone.0000542-Communicable1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> that cefixime can be used as first or second line therapy in the treatment of enteric fever. Based on the present study, we believe gatifloxacin to be an optimal choice in the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000542.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000542.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000542.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000542.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to sincerely thank all our CMA workers, namely, Surendra Shrestha,&#x000a0;Randip Tamrakar, Nabaraj Regmi, Balmukunda Neupane, Nabin Adhikari, and Sushila Bhattarai.
