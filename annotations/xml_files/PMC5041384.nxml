CWB consists of volitional acts that harm or intend to harm organizations and their stakeholders.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of mindfulness developed through <italic>Yoga</italic> practices on aggression and positive affectivity (PA) among working professionals who are involved in CWB.</p><p>PA reveals the degree, to which an individual feels energetic, enthusiastic, attentive, active, and alive.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] PA has been linked with work-life enrichment, job satisfaction, social support, and effective coping strategies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] PA is also positively associated with citizenship behavior.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] People with high PA have been found to be more mindful and they are able to regulate their affective experiences in a better way by generating and maintaining positive emotions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Act of aggressive and hostile behaviors has long been common at the workplace and it can lead to social, physical, mental, and occupational damages. Mindfulness is known to lower ego-involvement and it plays an important role of aggression mitigation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Study related to substance use among men showed that lower trait mindfulness was associated with higher level of aggression traits such as physical, verbal, and aggressive attitude.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p><italic>Yoga</italic> is known for its effect on body and psyche. <italic>Yoga</italic> sessions have proven to be beneficial in enhancing PA and decreasing negative affect.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] <italic>Yoga</italic> improved psychological well-being and mood among prisoners resulting in a positive effect on their aggressive behaviors.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In comparison to the normal people, prisoners usually have higher rates of negative affect, aggression, drug and alcohol abuse, and antisocial behavior.</p><p>Thus, it can be said that personality and temperament of an employee at the workplace can influence perceived stress and work engagement. <italic>Yoga</italic> improves attention and this quality can be helpful for an individual to remain focused in the present moment.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Once mind develops clarity, calmness, and focused approach through <italic>Yoga</italic> practices, staff members may be able to take charge of internal environment in terms of emotional stability and also of the external environment in terms of reacting to different stimuli and controlling aggression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized, double-blind study was approved by Swami Vivekananda <italic>Yoga</italic> Anusandhana Samsthana Institutional Ethics Committee, Bengaluru (ref. no. RES/IEC-SVYASA/35/2014; dt. 09/10/2014).</p><p>Participants were recruited from a private enterprise in Engineering Department of information technology sector in Pune. Adequate background information about the nature of the study was provided to participants and they were allowed to participate after they signed written informed consent form. CWB checklist (CWB-C) and other questionnaires were administered with the help of an independent psychologist who was not involved in the subject allocation or supervision of the classes. Conducting research on CWB represents significant challenges because of the negative and even illegal nature of these acts. In case of CWB, the participants are usually expected to rate themselves low on CWB scale. Since many of them were hesitant and apprehensive about the &#x0201c;self-perceived&#x0201d; consequences of their rating on CWB, they were assured of confidentiality of the information and their queries of specific questionnaires were also resolved in a detailed manner during rating the scale to allow them to be honest in their responses.</p><p>The enrolled subjects were randomized to either <italic>Yoga</italic> group or control (waitlisted) group. Randomization was done using a computer-based random generator by an independent supervisor who was not involved in the study assessments. In total, one hundred and sixty employees (total males = 88, total females = 72) were randomly selected and allocated into two groups (<italic>Yoga</italic> and control) having eighty participants per group. An official permission from the Institutional Research Ethical Committee was also taken before the commencement of the trial.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

Control group practiced loosening stretches, normal breathing, and resting activities, respectively, along with management lectures.

In both aggression and PA, confidence interval does not include 0 (zero); therefore, the conclusion is that (at the 0.05 level of significance), there is a statistically significant difference in the population means. Moreover, since there is no overlap of 95% confidence intervals, there is evidence that <italic>Yoga</italic> group has shown significant change as compared to the control group.

Findings encourage the practice of <italic>Yoga</italic> in the work setting to develop well-being by reducing hostile behaviors and creating a positive environment. The strength of <italic>Yoga</italic> is that it can be used as a self-management technique where an individual can practice it anywhere.
