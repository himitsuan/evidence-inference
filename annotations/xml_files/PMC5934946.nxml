Treatment option for pelvic organ prolapse includes both surgical and non-surgical intervention. The development of pelvic organ prolapse is an indication for major surgery among 20% of all women. Nevertheless, the recurrence of pelvic organ prolapse is detected among 58% of the patient after surgery. This highlights the need for preventive measures for reducing the impact of pelvic organ prolapse.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims and Objective:</title><p>To study the effect of 3 months yoga therapy in female patients suffering from mild pelvic organ prolapse.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>50 Participants were allocated into two groups (25 in each group) by generating Random allocation sequence. Women aged 20-60 with symptomatic mild pelvic organ prolapse in the yoga group were offered Mulabandha yoga therapy along with other conventional treatment modalities, while the control group was only on conventional treatment. All participants gave written informed consent. An assessment was done by improvement in chief complaints and Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 (PFDI-20) &#x00026; Pelvic floor impact Questionnaire-7 (PFIQ-7) at baseline and at the end of 4, 8 &#x00026; 12 weeks.

According to the international data, Oxford Family Planning Association UK, the hospital admission for uterine prolapse is 20.4%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Concerning about India, it is found that among women visiting private clinics in Bengal, Delhi, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh with gynecological problems, one in five are suffering from uterine prolapse.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Most women in developing countries have to undertake manual work on a regular basis, frequently involving heavy lifting, even while pregnant or shortly after delivery. This probably contributes to high rates of prolapse, and yet, paradoxically, prolapse makes it more difficult for women to undertake heavy work, over which they often have little or no choice. Undernutrition as a cause of poor tissue tensile strength may be a cofactor in the development of pelvic organ prolapse. Moderate and severe anemia also appear to be a risk factor associated with Pelvic organ prolapse.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Mula bandha is a most important part of the Hatha Yoga tradition often shadowed of its real grace and benefits due to lacunae of proper knowledge. The Sanskrit word Mula means &#x0201c;root, source, basis, lowest part or bottom, foundation.&#x0201d; Bandha means &#x0201c;lock, restrain, shut or close.&#x0201d; In the treatment of infertility, Mula bandha may be used as both a therapeutic and preventive practice. At the curative level, it allows us to regain a state of health on the physical, emotional, and mental planes, while at the preventive level, it allows us to maintain health and expand our normal, stable function to the cosmic level where we can do, and enjoy, so much more.</p><p>At the physical level, the practice of Mula bandha tones and strengthens the muscles of the pelvic region, especially the perineum, also playing a major role in increasing the circulation of concerned areas. The actions associated with it are also beneficial for supporting, toning, and strengthening the lower back. It also helps in supporting greater mobility of the pelvis. Due to the action of toning of the muscles in the pelvic region, it lifts and supports the lumbar spine, helping the upward extension of the spine, while toning and lengthening the psoas muscle and reducing tension in the lower back muscles and quadratus, thus effective to treat pelvic organ prolapse.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomized, intervention-controlled trial with 1:1 allocation of the participants into the two study groups. Participants were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and then were randomly allocated into two groups (yoga and control) by generating random allocation sequence. In yoga group, patients were advised Mula bandha whereas in the other group, patients were given dietary supplements (multivitamins) along with Mula bandha.</p><p>Assuming 20% change in the mean value and taking the alpha as 5% and power as 80%, the sample size calculated were 25 and 23, respectively. Therefore, the higher of the two, i.e., 25 was considered as the required sample size for each group, i.e., yoga and control group. Hence, a total of 50 cases were required for the study. It was further assumed that 10% cases might lose during follow-up score. Therefore, on whole, 56 participants were enrolled for the study among which 6 declined to participate.</p><p>Hence, in the present study, a total of fifty cases were registered from Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Sir Sunder Lal Hospital, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi and were randomly divided into two equal groups of 25 cases each. To ensure effectiveness of the Mula bandha yoga therapy, the present study advocates a minimum of 12 weeks (90 days) therapy. Participants were followed up with observation once in 4 weeks up to 12 weeks for assessment of the result and to check for symptomatic improvements.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Mechanism of Mula bandha</title><p>The probable mechanism of Mula bandha has been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The probable mechanism of action of Mula bandha</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-11-116-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Technique of Mula bandha [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</title><p>

However, no significant changes in chief complaints were seen in control group patients receiving only conventional therapy. Significant relief is suggestive of decrease in severity of symptoms after 12 weeks of yoga therapy. These findings are suggestive of the impact of intervention in the yoga therapy group and showed remarkable improvement in the above-said symptom. Mild grade prolapse could get reversed by consistent practice of Mula bandha yoga. This yoga also helps to maintain the pelvic floor muscle strength.</p><p>Pain associated with uterine prolapse can be located centrally or suprapubic and can be described as &#x0201c;dragging&#x0201d; in the groin. This pain is due to stretching of the ligamentous supports and secondarily to abrasion of the prolapsed tissues.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Observed improvements in the perception of pain (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in yoga group may result from increased blood supply, which is due to the regular practice of contraction and relaxation of the perineal muscles, i.e., Mula bandha causes increase in blood supply to the pelvic regions; hence, it results in normal stretching and healing of the wear and tear of PFMs. It may be helpful in pain reduction by having a direct effect on sympathetic nervous system fibers, which helps to control blood flow through pelvis. Various studies have shown that influencing the sympathetic nervous system by yoga can block pain. Hence, regular practice of Mula bandha could be helpful for attainment of normalcy of the symptoms.</p><p>Prolapsed vaginal tissue protrusion may lead to chronic vaginal discharge and bleeding due to ulceration. Observed improvements in prolapsed vaginal tissue and P/V discharge (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) can be explained as a regular indulgence in the intervention techniques, i.e. yoga may have positive effect on metabolism and other physiological processes.</p><p>Regarding perineal muscle laxity, the result demonstrates better improvement in yoga group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In yoga group doing Mula bandha, the vaginal muscles and perineum tone reach normal tone more smoothly and fastly in comparison to control group. In yoga, Mula bandha is one of the fundamentals of core body strength. The Mula bandha had significant role in strengthening the pelvic floor muscle, vaginal muscles, and perineum tone. There is evidence that a vaginal delivery significantly weakens and stretches the pelvic floor (Allen <italic>et al.</italic> 1990; Jones 1995; Bo <italic>et al.</italic> 2007) and that building up the PFMs improves the strength of the muscles (Harvey 2003; Bo <italic>et al.</italic> 2007a; Wagg and Bunn 2007).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Discussion on Pelvic Floor Disability Index-20 and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-7 Score</title><p>Females with mild prolapse who received Mula bandha yoga therapy showed greater improvement in PFDI-20 mean scores than did women randomized to a control group. Although the difference between the groups (5.7 points) was significant, it was below the presumed level of clinical relevance (15 points). Typical symptoms of prolapse (such as seeing or feeling a vaginal bulge) are thought to emerge when the leading edge of the prolapse is at or below the hymen.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, in women with mild prolapse, other common prolapse related symptoms, such as urinary and bowel symptoms, should be assessed. In this study, in women with mild prolapse, Mula bandha yoga mainly affected the urinary symptoms. The largest difference in mean change from baseline was achieved in the PFDI-20 subscale measuring urinary symptoms (Urogenital Distress Inventory-6). The other PFDI-20 subscales (measuring prolapse and bowel symptoms) showed no significant differences in change between the groups. The relation between prolapse and urinary symptoms is not yet completely understood. Although stress urinary incontinence and prolapse are thought to be two coexisting problems that share causative factors rather than having a cause and effect relation,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] prolapse might cause bladder outlet obstruction, leading to irritable bladder symptoms (urgency, urge incontinence, frequency, nocturia).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Similar findings were found for PFIQ-7 score.</p><p>Women receiving Mula bandha yoga therapy seemed to gain more insight into their symptoms and underlying conditions, leading to a higher subjective appreciation of improvement in the symptoms than was reflected in the change in PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to investigate the effects of Mula bandha yoga technique in a female population with symptomatic mild degree of prolapse, which were identified by screening. Three-month yoga therapy is safe and effective measure as adjuvant therapy to conventional treatment modalities in reducing severity of symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with mild degree of prolapse. Better conservative management with Mula bandha yoga therapy can help reduce dependence on pessaries, surgical interventions, and its associated side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Financial
