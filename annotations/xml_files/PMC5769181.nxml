The participants were randomly selected from the patients referring to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center in Isfahan, Iran.

Telenursing is a tool for providing ongoing care for patients with chronic conditions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Through creating an extensive connection between the patient and the hospital, telenursing leads to implementation of continuous care and maintenance of the well-being of patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The study by Zolfaghari <italic>et al</italic>. aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of follow-up by nurses through telephone calls and short message services (SMS) on adherence to treatment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] They showed a significant difference in the rate of adherence to the diabetes treatment regimen (physical activity, diabetes medication, and diet) in patients with diabetes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and a significant reduction in the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in the follow-up group (0.93%).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In a randomized controlled trial, a 2.9 and 2% decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin was, respectively, observed in the test and control groups in patients with diabetes type 1 or 2 in the age group of 18 years.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.455).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Ongoing relationships with patients, after visiting them at home, have a very important role in controlling diabetes. Studies on adults have illustrated that telephone follow-up by nurses with an effective plan to improve self-care, control blood sugar, and reduce symptoms in patients with diabetes showed favorable results. It seems that very little research in this area has been conducted on children. No follow-up was performed at the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center, Isfahan, Iran, following the given instructions. Because diabetes is a chronic disease and given the critical situation of children because of exposure to peer groups at school, the researcher found telephone follow-up by the center after training to be imperative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This quasi-experimental study with two groups (experimental and control) was performed in two stages in 2014. The study population consisted of children with type I diabetes in the age group of 10 to 18 years who were admitted to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center. With a 95% confidence interval and 84% statistical power, the number of participants for each group was calculated to be 35. The inclusion criteria included being a resident of Isfahan (Iran), in the age range of 10 to 18 years, diagnosed with type I diabetes at least 6 months prior to the study, having access to landline at home, not having any physical and mental problems or other chronic diseases, and not having experienced any stressful events at least 1 month prior to the study. The exclusion criteria included hospitalization, unwillingness to continue the study, occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, and experience of stressful events during the study. The participants were selected through random sampling method. After the approval of the ethics committee, the researcher visited the center and referred to the medical history files of patients with type I diabetes and prepared a list of patients who were covered by the center. Then, the participants were selected by a random draw from the mentioned list. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire on self-care and a glycosylated hemoglobin recording form. The questionnaire consisted of three parts. The first part included 13 questions regarding demographic characteristics and the second part consisted of 4 questions on the disease. The third part included 43 questions related to self-care and incorporated 8 dimensions of self-care regarding the individual aspects. To determine the scientific validity and reliability of the tools, content validity and test&#x02013;retest methods were used. The reliability coefficient of 0.95 was obtained. Data were collected through self-reporting by the child and measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin. Data gathering was performed at the time of enrollment and 12 weeks after the intervention. After registering the qualified candidates and obtaining the consent of their primary caregiver, questionnaires were completed by the children. Without the need for fasting, venous blood samples were taken to measure glycosylated hemoglobin. (The measurement of the glycosylated hemoglobin of all samples was performed in a laboratory using a Hitachi Autoanalyzer and Pars A1C kits). After this stage, the participants were assigned randomly to two groups of control and experimental, and the telephone intervention was implemented in the experimental group for 12 weeks. Phone calls were made by the researcher twice per week in the first month and once a week during the second and third months. The duration of the conversation was an average of 20 min. The content of the conversations included following up on the training provided by the center in connection with problems related to diabetes, obtaining each patient's specific complaints, analyzing the situation with the patient's assistance to determine the problem and finally providing a solution to the problem. Patients' questions were answered with regard to the level of their development, and the importance of implementing the methods taught was emphasized at the end of the conversation. In addition, the content of each conversation was recorded in a form consisting of two parts. The first part included the common problems of patients with diabetes and provided the necessary advice (on exercise, diet, insulin, etc.), and the second part was devoted to the specific needs of each client. In each session of the conversation, the needed guidance was provided and the content of the conversation was written in the forms. It is noteworthy that during the intervention period, the control group received training only from the center. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Researchers at all stages of the research paid careful attention to ethical principles. All the parents and children were given verbal and written information about the purpose and importance of the study. Written, informed consent was obtained from the parents of children before they completed the first questionnaire and they were free to withdraw from the study at any time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Participants in the two experimental and control groups were similar in terms of all demographic characteristics, clinical data, self-care, and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin levels [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].
