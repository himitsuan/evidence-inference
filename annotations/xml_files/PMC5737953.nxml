It was performed at the dermatology department of the Medicinal Faculty of the Charles University of Prague and at 3 dermatology ambulatory care centers with participants recruited from regular outpatients presenting for herpes episodes. No financial incentive was given for study participation.</p><p id="p0020">Patients were assigned a consecutive random number according to their entry into the trial. A random list in blocks of 10 ensuring a balanced distribution of patients to the 2 study arms was prepared in advance by the study sponsor using a random number generator (RandList version 1.2; DatInf GmbH, T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany). The random list was closed after labeling and only reopened after official closing of the study and the database during analysis. The physicians had no access to the random code.</p><p id="p0025">The study duration was up to 10 days or up to the visit when the lesions were fully epithelialized or encrusted. Examinations and documentations by the physician were made at Days 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Additional examinations on Days 8 (&#x000b1;1 day) and 10 were foreseen for patients still requiring therapy at the previous visit.</p><sec id="s0015"><title>Study medication</title><p id="p0030">One study arm received a lip balm containing 0.5% propolis special extract GH 2002 (Herpetino batch No. 20/0913; Gehrlicher Pharmazeutische Extrakte, Eurasburg, Germany). The active constituent of the study preparation was the purified propolis semiliquid extract GH 2002 (extract batch No. 9494, drug extract ratio 2:1, extraction solvent ethanol; excipients in the lip balm: water, xylitol, <italic>Butyrospermum parkii</italic>, hydrogenated polyisobutene, <italic>Simmondsia chinensis</italic> seed oil, <italic>Prunus amygdalis dulcis</italic> (sweet almond) oil, panthenol, polyglyceryl-4-isostearate, cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1, dimethicone, hexyl laurate, sodium chloride, tocopheryl acetate, and bisabolol). The extract GH 2002 is purified from potentially allergenic pollen, waxes, and resins, and is standardized to a defined content of flavonoids, polyphenols, and phenylcarboxylic acids.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="p0035">The second study arm applied a 5% aciclovir cream (Herpesin batch No. 10/1013; Teva Pharmaceuticals CR, Prague, Czech Republic) with ingredients including carbomer 934, sodium hydroxide, dimethicone, cetyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulphate, methyl parabene, and purified water.</p><p id="p0040">The 2 creams were manufactured to be similar in appearance and consistency; both were prepared as externally undistinguishable tubes with 10 g cream (sufficient for a study period of 10 days) and were delivered to the study center with a prenumbered code according to the blinded random number list. The content of the tubes differed slightly with respect to color and odor, which is why the study was considered single-blinded because as the physicians might have known the color and odor difference. The patients were not expected to know the difference between the study preparations; thus, no undue bias was expected.</p><p id="p0045">Each preparation was applied 5 times daily (every 3&#x02013;5 hours) to the entire upper and lower lip, corresponding to a daily dose of approximately 1 g cream.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Primary and secondary parameters</title><p id="p0050">The first aim of the study was the comparison of median times to full encrustation or epithelialization between groups. According to previous experience with aciclovir and propolis extract the median time to this clinical point was estimated to be reached within approximately 5 days.</p><p id="p0055">Treatment was planned for up to 10 days to cover the typical duration of an untreated episode of herpes labialis. After 10 days the healing process should be in its final stages even in patients not responding to the study medication.</p><p id="p0060">Secondary parameters were the assessments of typical symptoms of lip sores (pain on a visual analogue scale, itching/burning, and tension/swelling on a 4-point verbal rating scale), and an evaluation of global efficacy by the physician on a 4-point verbal rating scale. A descriptive analysis of the development of the individual symptoms of the episode was foreseen as a secondary outcome parameter, including the percentage of patients skipping the vesicular or erosive phase and the calculation of the number needed to treat. Subgroup analyses according to age and gender were also planned.</p><p id="p0065">Safety of application was addressed through an analysis of adverse events, including allergic reactions and skin irritation actively discussed with the patients at each visit. In addition, patients were asked to bring the medication tubes back for inspection for the assessment of compliance.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="p0070">Patients of both genders aged 18 to 70 years could only be included if they had visible eruptions (erythematous or papular) for no more than 30 hours before the first examination, and if their history showed at least 4 previous episodes of herpes labialis. Patients in the prodromal stage; that is, with burning or tension of the lips only, and patients with progressed stages (ie, vesicular, erosive, or encrusted) were not eligible. The inclusion and exclusion criteria with respect to the stage of the episode had to be strictly adhered to because they were the foundation of a comparability of results with published data on aciclovir.</p><p id="p0075">Further exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to any component of the test preparation or the reference, concomitant viral infections, acquired or malignant immunodeficiency, including HIV or leukemia, the severity of the herpes labialis requiring systemic treatment, or the concurrent use of other topical preparations or systemic antiviral medication. The use of such preparations was also not permitted for the duration of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Case number calculation</title><p id="p0080">A case number calculation was made based on the results of a previously performed dose-finding study.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The study preparation had reduced the time to complete encrusting of herpes lesions by approximately 1 day compared to a 0.1% formulation, which still showed activity. It was therefore anticipated that 0.5% propolis would reduce time to complete encrusting or epithelialization by approximately 1.5 days compared with the untreated course of the episode. Aciclovir shortens the duration of herpes labialis episodes by approximately 1 day versus placebo. The case number calculation was therefore based on the assumption that the study preparation should be superior over aciclovir by approximately 0.5 days, as judged by the median time to full encrusting or epithelialization. The case number calculation was based on an expected dropout rate of 20% and a power of at least 80% in the superiority testing, which led to the conclusion of 190 patients to be included per group.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Vote of the ethics committee</title><p id="p0085">The study was planned and carried out in accordance with the criteria of Good Clinical Practice and the ethical standards defined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The advantage of propolis lip balm over aciclovir was especially visible within the first 3 to 5 days after the beginning of treatment. It is no contradiction that after 10 days there was no longer a significant difference between propolis and aciclovir lip balm: episodes of herpes labialis are self-limiting conditions and would normally be expected to heal within 10 to 14 days, if left untreated. The aim of a medication is to shorten this period, and a shortening of the herpes episode was demonstrated for both aciclovir and propolis extract.</p><p id="p0185">The lack of a placebo control might be considered a downside of the study protocol. However, the efficacy of aciclovir in the tested concentration is generally accepted as proven, and can also be derived from the outcome of this study. In the Czech Republic, where this study was performed, the use of placebo is considered ethically unacceptable when there is a reference treatment with accepted efficacy. The dosing of aciclovir corresponded to a dose accepted as efficacious. The worst-case imputation method for missing values would be in favor of aciclovir. The median and average time to complete encrustation or epithelialization was approximately 1 day shorter in the propolis group than in the aciclovir group, which underlines the clinical importance of the findings beyond statistical significance. In addition, a higher proportion of patients in the propolis group skipped the vesicular and the erosive stage.</p><p id="p0190">The measured advantage of the study preparation over the reference population with respect to pain reduction, reaching 8 mm on the VAS at mid study, was considered of borderline clinical importance. Such a difference is still noticeable to the patients,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> especially because the patients treated with propolis reached a defined amount of pain improvement approximately 1 to 2 days earlier than patients treated with the reference balm.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0195">An important aspect of studies in the treatment of herpes labialis is the selection of a clinically exact defined starting point for the assurance of comparability between groups. In this study, all patients were in the papular or erythematous stage. The findings are therefore applicable to the early stages of a herpes episode. We are already examining the question of whether the advantages of propolis over aciclovir are still visible if lip balm is first applied when patients are already in the vesicular stage.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p id="p0200">This clinical study was supported by funds from the companies Harras Pharma Curarina GmbH (Munich, Germany; applicant for the marketing authorization of the study preparation) and Gehrlicher Pharmazeutische Extrakte GmbH (Eurasburg, Germany; manufacturer of the study preparation).
