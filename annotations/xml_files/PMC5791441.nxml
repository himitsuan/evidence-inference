If the mother feels that she can cope well with stress, will be protected from the harmful effects of stress on your health. Self-efficacy contained individual's assessment of her ability to deal with stressful situations. Strengthen the spiritual beliefs of the patient causes her to be a good result every situation even incurable condition. This study aimed to determine the effect of religious-spiritual support on childbirth self-efficacy in primiparous women.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>This is a quasi-experimental study carried on seventy primiparous women; participants were randomly divided into two intervention and control groups. The intervention group received the e-learning package based on religious-spiritual content. Self-efficacy questionnaire by both groups before and 4 weeks after it was completed. Collected data were entered into SPSS version 11 descriptive statistics, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, and paired <italic>t</italic>-test which were used for analysis of data.

The cesarean section rate in Iran (2009) was 46%, and the rate of elective cesarean section in Ardabil in the year 2010 was 58.6% that is a high figure compared to global statistics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] If the mother feels that she can deal with stress, she will be immune to the bad impact of stress on her health. The benefits of behaviors that control stress are verified by most people. In fact, self-efficacy is an important prerequisite of behaving in stressful situations. Self-efficacy includes the individual's assessment of her/his ability to deal with stressful situations. Studies indicate a connection between the fear of childbirth and self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The use of appropriate strategies to enhance the perception of pregnant women about e-ability to perform normal childbirth and coping with the pain of childbirth should be considered in prenatal education. Furthermore, effective interventions such as targeted and appropriate educational interventions to increase self-efficacy as well as attention to spirituality are useful and effective to reduce the fear of childbirth.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The psychologists argue that religious ritual and spirituality help humans to understand the meaning of life events, especially painful events and may create support and joyfulness in people's spirits.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Enhancing the patient's spiritual beliefs lead the patient to achieve good results in any situation even die-hard diseases.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The results of the study by Zighami Mohammadi showed that an increase in spiritual health in adolescents diagnosed with thalassemia reduces the hopelessness and increases their social skills.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] French study also indicated that spirituality improves social behaviors and relationships.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The findings of a study in Italy (write the author's name) indicated that providing spiritual care promotes the spiritual health of cancer patients and strengthens their religious faith and also improves their quality of life.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>So far, several training methods were used in the field of childbirth. However, numerous problems related to the presence of experienced and specialist training providers, new educational facilities in the region, and access to modern training technologies as well as the problem of presence of learners in the in-person classes have caused the development of teaching methods &#x02013; remote learning by taking advantage of educational software and technology.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Meanwhile, increasing access to e-learning hardware and software has opened a new horizon for the educational institutions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The use of these facilities for training helps the realization of the pivotal comprehensive training, lifetime learning, active learning, and interaction in e-learning. Furthermore, these factors are recognized as the criteria of training quality.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The Mohamadirizi study showed that the amount of learning in pregnant women about neonatal care in the e-learning group was more compared to the control group, which was under the usual training.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The Campbell results about the impact of a computer training program on improving women's nutrition indicated that Compact disc (CD)-based training increases self-efficacy and awareness about low-fat diet but not on following through with the low-fat diet.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Azhari <italic>et al</italic>., breastfeeding training using images without direct involvement of trainer increased breastfeeding self-efficacy more effectively.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>With respect to the above-mentioned issues and self-efficacy issues can be influenced by the level of spiritual and religious, this study aimed to investigate the effect of spiritual-religious support on childbirth self-efficacy in nulliparous women in Isfahan. Furthermore, according to the importance of self-efficacy to control fear and to deal with the labor pain and choosing the appropriate delivery method, targeted interventions to improve the rate of self-efficacy in pregnant mothers are essential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental two-group study conducted on 70 primiparous women (35 in spiritual-religious support based on multimedia and mobile educational group and 35 in routine group) in Isfahan in 2016. The inclusion criteria were being primigravida, having Iranian nationality and residing in Isfahan, having at least the literacy to read and write Persian, having a mobile with android software and being able to use them, being able to speak, hear, and see, and lack of a high-risk pregnancy. Sample size was calculated by the use of mean comparison formula (with confidence interval = 95% and power = 90%). The researcher referred to Health Care Center in Isfahan after obtaining approval for the study from the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Sampling was by convenient sampling method, in which among the women daily referring to the center; one was randomly assigned to the spiritual-religious support based on multimedia and mobile group and one to the routine group. At first, the researcher selected the qualified subjects based on the subjects&#x02019; selection checklist and inclusion criteria, gave them an informed consent form to sign, and explained the goal of research to them. Then, before any education was given, a questionnaire of demographic and prenatal characteristics and a childbirth self-efficacy questionnaire (efficacy in active phase) were filled by the patients in both groups. Childbirth self-efficacy questionnaire in active phase had 16 questions that sort by 10 Likert scale from 1 (complete well) to 10 (complete not well) with a score range of 16&#x02013;160.

In this respect, the results of Kuo study showed that the level of learning in pregnant women about taking care of the baby in the group that was trained through e-learning was higher compared to the control group (usual training).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The Huang study in Taipei was an experimental double-group study and aimed to determine the effect of network-based educational program on the knowledge and attitude of pregnant women.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The results showed that the score of awareness in the experimental group was increased after the intervention.
