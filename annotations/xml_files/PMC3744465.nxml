For any particular plant extract studied within an exercise context, few papers are available, and research designs vary widely with regard to the supplementation dose (near normal daily intake to supramaximal volumes) and regimen (acute to multiple weeks and months), the type of exercise stress (moderate to prolonged and intensive), type of subject (trained and untrained), and outcome measures (predominantly oxidative stress) <xref rid="pone.0072215-Lyall1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072215-MorillasRuiz1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The use of metabolomics in nutritional sciences is gaining momentum, and global metabolomics profiling was utilized in this study to help capture the potential influence of a polyphenol- and protein-rich supplement in countering physiologic stress indicators associated with an intensified 3-day exercise training period. Metabolomics is particularly useful in interpreting human responses to polyphenol manipulation of the diet, and improves the capacity to capture their complex and subtle influences on whole body metabolism and physiology.</p><p>We hypothesized that a high-dose polyphenol supplement would serve as a partial countermeasure to inflammation and oxidative stress induced by a 3-day intensified training period, and that metabolomics would capture this benefit more effectively than traditional biomarkers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072215.s005">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072215.s006">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects and Research Design</title><p>Subject recruitment was conducted via mass advertising to running clubs in the Charlotte, NC, metropolitan area. Subjects were recruited by the Human Performance Laboratory Research Manager, and included 38 healthy, non-smoking long distance male or female runners ages 19&#x02013;45 years who regularly competed in marathon and half-marathon road races and were capable of running 2.5 h at high intensity on laboratory treadmills. During the study, subjects consented to train normally, maintain weight, and avoid the use of all herbs and medications known to affect inflammation and immune function for the duration of the study (in particular, all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Subjects also agreed to avoid all vitamin and mineral supplements above 100% the U.S. Daily Value. Runners successfully completing orientation and baseline testing (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;35) were randomized by the research manager using 1&#x02236;1 allocation and a random number table (without blocking) to intervention [polyphenol soy protein complex (PSPC)] (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17) or placebo groups (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18), with supplements administered over a 17-d period using double-blinded methods and a parallel group design.

Blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes, allowed to stand at room temperature for 15&#x02013;20 min, centrifuged at 2500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, aliquoted, and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. For each serum sample, 100 &#x000b5;L was used for analyses. Using an automated liquid handler (Hamilton LabStar, Salt Lake City, UT), protein was precipitated from the plasma with methanol that contained four standards to report on extraction efficiency. The resulting supernatant was split into equal aliquots for analysis on the three platforms. Aliquots, dried under nitrogen and vacuum-desiccated, were subsequently either reconstituted in 50 &#x000b5;L 0.1% formic acid in water (acidic conditions) or in 50 &#x000b5;L 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water, pH 8 (basic conditions) for the two UHPLC/MS/MS<sup>2</sup> analyses or derivatized to a final volume of 50 &#x000b5;L for GC/MS analysis using equal parts bistrimethyl-silyl-trifluoroacetamide and solvent mixture acetonitrile:dichloromethane:cyclohexane (5&#x02236;4:1) with 5% triethylamine at 60&#x000b0;C for 1 h. In addition, three types of controls were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples: aliquots of a well-characterized human plasma pool served as technical replicates throughout the data set, extracted water samples served as process blanks, and a cocktail of standards spiked into every analyzed sample allowed instrument performance monitoring. Experimental samples and controls were randomized across platform run days.</p><p>For UHLC/MS/MS<sup>2</sup> analysis, aliquots were separated using a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters, Millford, MA) and analyzed using an LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) which consisted of an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and linear ion-trap (LIT) mass analyzer. The MS instrument scanned 99&#x02013;1000 m/z and alternated between MS and MS<sup>2</sup> scans using dynamic exclusion with approximately 6 scans per second. Derivatized samples for GC/MS were separated on a 5% phenyldimethyl silicone column with helium as the carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60&#x000b0;C to 340&#x000b0;C and then analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) operated at unit mass resolving power with electron impact ionization and a 50&#x02013;750 atomic mass unit scan range. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra, and were curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon Inc.
