Mini-dose ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 metabolism of APV (to which FPV is converted) and ATV, thereby decreasing their clearance, raising their plasma concentrations and exposure, and increasing their elimination half-lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To date, ritonavir 200 mg QD has been the recommended boosting dose for FPV QD regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. COL10053 showed that this dose provides a mean plasma APV concentration at the end of a dosing interval (C<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>) of 1.4 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which is over 9-fold above the mean APV protein binding-adjusted 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for wild-type virus (0.146 &#x003bc;g/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and 4-fold above the historical C<sub>&#x003c4; </sub>value observed with unboosted FPV 1400 mg BID (which, in turn, is 2-fold higher than the IC<sub>50 </sub>for wild-type virus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Ritonavir 100 mg QD is the only boosting dose recommended for use with ATV 300 mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This dose increases the ATV minimum plasma concentrations (C<sub>min</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 5-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively, than can be attained with unboosted ATV 400 mg QD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>As the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events and unfavorable lipid elevations is directly proportional to the magnitude of ritonavir dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], using the lowest ritonavir dose possible for PI boosting would be expected to incur the fewest tolerability problems. With FPV, several pharmacokinetic studies that have evaluated a low ritonavir boosting dose of 100 mg QD reported that it provides a mean or median steady-state APV C<sub>min </sub>6- to 13-fold higher than the protein binding-corrected 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for wild-type HIV (0.146 &#x003bc;g/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and that patients may experience better GI tolerability and less elevation in lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>As no study to date has compared the long-term efficacy of all-QD FPV/r100 and ATV/r100 regimens, we conducted a clinical trial evaluating their relative efficacy/safety in combination with QD tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) in antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve, HIV-infected patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Male and non-pregnant female outpatients were eligible for enrollment if they were &#x02265; 18 years old, had HIV-1 infection documented by HIV-1 antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot test, were antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve (&#x0003c;14 days of antiretroviral treatment), and were not receiving immunomodulatory drugs. Women were enrollable if they were postmenopausal, sterilized, or, if of childbearing potential, had a documented negative serum or urine pregnancy test (&#x003b2;-human chorionic gonadotropin) &#x02264; 7 days of study drug administration and used two methods of contraception (barrier method mandatory).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>This randomized, open-label, multicenter study was conducted between April 2005 and September 2006 at 16 outpatient sites in the United States. Enrollment was stratified at screening by plasma HIV-1 RNA to one of two strata (&#x0003c;100,000 and &#x02265; 100,000 copies/mL). To determine study eligibility, study candidates underwent a medical history, physical examination, CDC classification, viral load, CD4+ counts, clinical chemistry values, liver function tests, hematology, hepatitis B and C serology, and serum &#x003b2;-human chorionic gonadotropin test (women of childbearing age only) at the screening visit within 30 days pre-study. All enrolled patients were randomly assigned to one of two regimens for 48 weeks:</p><p>&#x02022; FPV/r 1400 mg/100 mg QD + TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg QD</p><p>&#x02022; ATV/r 300 mg/100 mg QD + TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg QD</p><p>FPV/r and TDF/FTC were administered with or without food and ATV and ritonavir were given together with food. The FPV dose was given as two 700-mg tablets of Lexiva<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg as one co-formulated tablet of Truvada<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA), ritonavir as one 100-mg soft-gel capsule of Norvir<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and ATV as two 150-mg capsules of Reyataz<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ). Patients were counseled regarding adherence at weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and from the week 4 visit onward they were asked by study personnel about their level of adherence to each drug in their regimen.</p><p>If patients experienced FPV- or ATV-attributable (per investigator), treatment-limiting toxicities, they were discontinued from the study. If TDF/FTC-attributable, treatment-limiting toxicities occurred, abacavir (ABC) 600 mg/lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg (Epzicom<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline) QD could be substituted. No other substitutions were allowed. All patients provided written informed consent to participate, and the protocol for the study was approved by the institutional review boards at each treatment site.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessment</title><p>The primary efficacy measure was comparison of the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL at week 48, with secondary endpoints being proportion with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL at 24 weeks and &#x0003c; 400 copies/mL at 24 and 48 weeks; change from baseline in CD4+ counts at weeks 24 and 48; and HIV treatment-emergent resistance patterns (described in a separate paper).</p><p>HIV-1 RNA was measured, and change from baseline tabulated, at baseline (week 0), at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and at withdrawal using the Roche Amplicor MONITOR Ultrasensitive assay (version 1.5; lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ] 50 copies/mL) (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, New Jersey) and HIV-1 MONITOR Version 1.0 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (LLOQ, 400 copies/mL) (Roche, Nutley, New Jersey). Virologic failure was defined two ways: 1) if prior to week 24, it was defined as a reduction of plasma HIV-1 RNA level to &#x0003c;50 copies/mL on two consecutive occasions with a subsequent increase to &#x02265; 400 copies/mL on two consecutive occasions 2&#x02013;4 weeks apart; 2) if it occurred at week 24 or later, virologic failure was said to have occurred if plasma HIV-1 RNA level was &#x02265; 400 copies/mL on two consecutive occasions 2&#x02013;4 weeks apart. Immunologic response was assessed by measuring change in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte cell count from baseline by flow cytometry at weeks 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and at withdrawal.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessment</title><p>Patients were monitored for adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and any HIV-related illnesses at weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and at withdrawal. The severity of adverse events was graded according to DAIDS criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, at weeks 0, 24, and 48, a fasting lipid panel was done and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In cases of elevated lipids, hypolipidemic agents could be prescribed at the discretion of the investigators. However, usage of lovastatin and simvastatin was prohibited, and atorvastatin and fluvastatin were to be used only on a precautionary basis in view of some potential for a drug interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 50 patients per treatment arm was targeted based on practical rather than statistical considerations. No power calculations were made to determine this sample size. Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat: exposed (ITT:E) population, which comprised all patients exposed to &#x02265; 1 dose of randomized study medication. Proportions of patients achieving &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL (primary efficacy parameter) and &#x0003c;400 copies/mL were analyzed by an ITT: observed analysis, which included all observed data, and an ITT: missing/discontinuation = failure (ITT: MD = F) analysis, in which patients with missing data or data collected after discontinuation of randomized study medication were considered failures. Between-treatment comparisons of these proportions were made by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA and differences in CD4+ count changes by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. Differences were considered statistically significant if <italic>p </italic>was &#x0003c; 0.05. Descriptive statistics alone were applied to all other data comparisons, including safety parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics and disposition</title><p>One hundred-six patients entered the study and 94 completed, 45 in the FPV/r100 arm and 49 in the ATV/r100 arm (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Evaluation of grade 2&#x02013;4 treatment-related adverse events showed that these occurred more frequently in the ATV/r100 arm than in the FPV/r100 arm (57% vs 15%), driven largely by ATV-related hepatic effects.

Hicks et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] reported that at 48 weeks, the proportion of ART-na&#x000ef;ve patients (baseline median HIV-1 RNA 4.8 log<sub>10 </sub>copies/mL, CD4+ count 190 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) able to achieve HIV-1 RNA levels &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL was as high or higher (depending on the type of analysis method), with an FPV/r100-containing QD regimen + ABC/3TC than with a FPV/r200-containing QD regimen with the same nucleoside backbone (79% vs 63% [ITT: M = F analysis], 92% vs 80% [observed analysis]). DeWit et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] evaluated FPV/r100 + TDF + 3TC (<italic>n </italic>= 57) (or FTC <italic>n </italic>= 19]) in ART-na&#x000ef;ve patients (baseline median HIV-1 RNA 4.9 log<sub>10 </sub>copies/mL, CD4+ count 171 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) and noted that at 48 weeks, 86% had HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL (ITT: M = F) and CD4+ counts had increased above baseline by a median of 268 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. TELEX II reported that patients stabilized (HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL) for 48 weeks on FPV/r200 QD plus TDF/FTC 300/200 mg QD remained stabilized 4 weeks after reducing the ritonavir boosting dose to 100 mg QD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The FPV/r100 regimen also is justified by four pharmacokinetic studies that reported little or no difference in the APV C<sub>min </sub>or AUC exposure in patients treated with FPV/r100 and FPV/r200 QD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], possibly because ritonavir at 100 mg appears to predominantly inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism of APV, whereas ritonavir at 200 mg may have a combination of CYP3A4 inhibitory and induction effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As of October 12, 2007, ritonavir 100 mg QD boosting of FPV dosing was approved by the FDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and listed as an alternative regimen in the DHHS HIV treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Current International AIDS Society (IAS) treatment guidelines recommend ritonavir-boosted FPV as a recommended PI-based treatment for the initial treatment of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and the British HIV Association (BHIVA) treatment guidelines list ritonavir-boosted FPV as an alternative first-line regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of the ATV/r100 regimen observed in our study was comparable to that reported in SHARE, which evaluated ATV/r100 + ABC/3TC in 111 ART-na&#x000ef;ve patients (baseline median HIV-1 RNA 5.06 log<sub>10 </sub>copies/mL, CD4+ count 207 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. At 48 weeks, 77% of ATV/r100-treated patients in SHARE achieved HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 50 copies/mL by ITT: M = F analysis and 90% by ITT: observed analysis, and their CD4+ cell count increased above baseline by a median of 188 cell/mm<sup>3</sup>. Inclusion of a 100-mg dose of ritonavir was important in the ATV regimen to counteract the previously documented TDF-related 23% reduction in ATV C<sub>min </sub>and 25% reduction in ATV exposure that is believed to be due to a physicochemical interaction of ATV and TDF in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As ritonavir 100 mg increases ATV C<sub>min </sub>by 3-fold higher than is attainable with unboosted ATV 400 mg QD, this dose compensates for the negative pharmacokinetic effects of TDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As of January 2008, ATV/r100-based regimens are considered first-line PI regimens by DHHS HIV treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], as recommended PI regimens by IAS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and as alternative PI regimens by BHIVA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Grade 2&#x02013;4 treatment-related adverse GI effects with FPV/r100 were observed, but the incidence was generally lower than has been reported with FPV boosted by r200 QD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, when a direct comparison of FPV/r100 vs FPV/r200 regimens was done in ART-na&#x000ef;ve patients, the FPV/r100 regimen showed less grade 2&#x02013;4 nausea (3% vs 5%) and diarrhea (14% vs 18%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, where such a comparison was made in healthy volunteers, a lower frequency of nausea (11% vs 27%) and loose stools (22% vs 29%) was also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The high incidence of increased bilirubin in the ATV group was expected, as this has been described in previous ATV/r studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Fifty-eight percent of our patients entered the trial with GFR &#x0003c; 90 mL/min (31 in the ATV/r100 arm and 19 in the FPV/r100 arm), indicating some level of renal dysfunction pre-study in a substantial proportion of the study population. GFR changes were noted in both treatment arms, and reduction in GFR to below 50 mL/min resulted in 3 patients needing to be discontinued from the trial. Pharmacokinetic studies have established a drug-drug interaction between some PI's and TDF resulting in increased tenofovir concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Other data have suggested that diminished TDF renal tubule efflux is responsible for increased TDF concentrations within renal cells and plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This finding has been postulated as a potential explanation for the decreased GFR seen in some patients treated with boosted PI's and TDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The boosted PIs ATV, lopinavir, saquinavir, and darunavir have been associated with an increase in tenofovir concentrations during co-administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], whereas this has not been observed with fosamprenavir (boosted and unboosted), indinavir (unboosted), tipranavir (boosted), and nelfinavir (unboosted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Wai et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] noted that the incidence of TDF-related GFR reduction is greater when RTV is administered concurrently in TDF-based regimens. This underscores the importance of achieving maximal boosting with the lowest possible RTV dose. As some factors that can contribute to renal decline in patients may not be known when they initially seek treatment, it is advisable that when a TDF/FTC backbone is being considered for use with PI-based therapy, renal function should be assessed at baseline and throughout treatment.</p><p>The magnitude of elevated total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and especially triglycerides observed in the FPV/r100 arm was lower than has been reported with FPV/r 1400/200 mg QD regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Median increase in HDL-cholesterol levels, a lipid change associated with reduction in cardiac risk, was observed in this study just as it has been in all other studies evaluating FPV/r100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A favorable change in lipid profile while maintaining clinical efficacy also has been reported within 4 weeks after ART-na&#x000ef;ve patients were switched from FPV/r200 + TDF/FTC to FPV/r100 + TDF/FTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Where FPV/r100- and FPV/r200-containing regimens have been directly compared over 48 weeks, no major differences in lipid profiles were seen in one study (and no greater lipid effects at 48 weeks compared to 24 weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas in the other study, FPV/r100 was associated with a less pronounced rise in triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although our study showed that the triglyceride increase at week 48 exceeded the NCEP cut-off in 50% of FPV/r100 vs 39% of ATV/r100 patients, they remained normal or just borderline high for most patients. In view of the minor lipid changes observed over 48 weeks with FPV/r 1400/100 mg QD, little or no lipid advantage was apparent for the ATV/r regimen.</p><p>This study is the first head-to-head clinical trial to compare FPV/r100- and ATV/r100-based regimens. The primary limitation of the study was its small sample size as it was done on a pilot basis. The study provides useful information since the study population was diverse with respect to gender, race, and ethnicity and mirrors the population where the epidemic is seen today.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this pilot study showed that all-QD FPV/r100 and ATV/r100, in combination with TDF/FTC, provided similar virologic suppression and CD4+ cell increases through 48 weeks.
