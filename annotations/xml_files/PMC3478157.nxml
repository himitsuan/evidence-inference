We examined the safety and efficacy of VigRX Plus (VXP) &#x02013; a proprietary polyherbal preparation for improving male sexual function, in a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled, parallel groups, multi-centre study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>78 men aged 25&#x02013;50&#x02009;years of age; suffering from mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (ED), participated in this study. Subjects were randomized to receive VXP or placebo at a dose of two capsules twice daily for 12&#x02009;weeks. The international index of erectile function (IIEF) was the primary outcome measure of efficacy. Other efficacy measures were: Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS), Serum testosterone, Semen analysis, Investigator&#x02019;s Global assessment and Subjects&#x02019; opinion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In subjects receiving VXP, the IIEF-Erectile Function (EF) scores improved significantly as compared to placebo. After 12&#x02009;weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) IIEF-EF score at baseline increased from 16.08 (2.87) to 25.08 (4.56) in the VXP group versus 15.86 (3.24) to 16.47 (4.25) in the placebo group (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Similar results were observed in each of the remaining four domains of the IIEF (orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction).There was a significant difference for VXP versus placebo comparison of mean (sd) EDITS scores of patients: 82.31(20.23) vs 36.78(22.53) and partners :(82.75(9.8) vs 18.50(9.44);<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001. Thirty-five out of 39 (90%) subjects from the VXP group and one (3%) from the placebo group wished to continue with the treatment they received. Investigator&#x02019;s global assessment rated VXP therapy as very good to excellent in more than 50% patients and placebo therapy as fair to good in about 25% of patients. Incidence of side effects and subject&#x02019;s rating for tolerability of treatment was similar in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VigRX Plus was well tolerated and more effective than placebo in improving sexual function in men.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinical Trial Registry India, CTRI/2009/091/000099, 31-03-2009</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is defined as the persistent inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>One of the oldest diseases known to mankind, ED affects 52% of 40- to 70-year-old men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] with estimates predicting the incidence to rise to over 320 million by the year 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The earliest reports of medical therapies for ED are found in ancient medical literature prescribing the use of numerous herbs and natural ingredients for sexual rejuvenation and a healthy progeny. As sexual medicine evolved, introduction of intracavernous injection therapy followed by phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE type-5) inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of ED. Despite the enormous success of pharmacological agents and a wide variety of treatment choices currently available, the ED sufferer continues to resort to natural alternatives or herbal supplements to regain his sexual vigor.</p><p>Clinicians on the other hand, do not wholeheartedly recommend herbal or alternative therapies, mainly due to a lack of adequate evidence from robustly designed scientific studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the absence of any regulatory obligations to undertake rigorous testing for safety and efficacy of dietary supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], there is no impetus for evaluation of herbal or dietary supplements before they are sold over-the-counter. Manufacturers base the advertising or labeling claims for such products on the testing of individual ingredients rather than the whole composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There are also risks attendant upon self-medication and unmonitored use of these products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Evidence of contamination of herbal products with PDE type-5 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] further prompts the need for companies to act responsibly and encourage third-party scientists to conduct efficacy and safety studies on natural products claiming therapeutic health benefits.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a multi-herb formulation marketed as VigRx Plus (Leading Edge Herbals), created for enhancement of sexual health in men. Development of this product was based on the preliminary evaluation of a first generation product, VigRX, consisting of a proprietary blend of <italic>Panax ginseng</italic><italic>Serenoa repens</italic><italic>Gingko biloba</italic><italic>Crataegus laevigata</italic><italic>Ptychopetalum olacoides</italic><italic>Erythroxylum catuaba</italic><italic>Cuscuta chinensis</italic>, and <italic>Epimedium sagittatum</italic> extract. In two different studies in male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats, VigRX was shown to engender a marked improvement in sexual behaviour including decreased intromission and ejaculation latencies, and increased intromission, ejaculation and mounting frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the same study, assays for pharmaceutical adulteration found that VigRX did not contain any detectable levels of known PDE-5 inhibitors including sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil or related analogues. In <italic>vitro</italic> assays also determined that VigRX is able to inhibit the Rho-kinase. Rho-kinase is an enzyme that plays an important role in maintaining the flaccid state of the penis through cavernosal vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and is being increasingly considered as emerging target for the treatment of erectile dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. VigRX, however, exhibited a relatively high inhibition concentration in the Rho-kinase inhibition assay, indicating that a large dose would be necessary to achieve similar results in a living system. Hence, three more ingredients <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic><italic>Turnera diffusa</italic> and Bioperine&#x000ae; (piperine) were added to the formulation. The resulting new formulation, named VigRX Plus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), was evaluated for its aphrodisiac properties in male albino Wistar rats. Treatment with VigRX Plus at the dose of 450&#x02009;mg/kg showed a significant increase in ejaculation frequency on day 7 and a non-significant increase on day 14 with a marginal increase in testosterone concentration in serum and number of spermatogonia cells in seminiferous tubules of testes <italic>(Unpublished data;</italic><italic>Available upon</italic><italic>request).</italic> An acute oral toxicity study of VigRX Plus tablet blend observed no lethality, nor adverse effects at single oral doses up to 4,000&#x02009;mg/kg in female rats <italic>(Unpublished data,</italic><italic>Available upon</italic><italic>request)</italic>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of VigRX Plus</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Ingredients (Botanical names)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Part used</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Quantity per capsule (mg)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Panax ginseng<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Root<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Serenoa repens<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Berry<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crategus rivularis<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Berry<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ginkgo Biloba<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Leaf<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Turnera diffusa<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Leaf<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tribulus terrestris<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Vine<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">075<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Erythroxylum catuaba<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Bark<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">050<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ptychopetalum olacoides<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Bark<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">050<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cuscuta chinensis<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Seed<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">025<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epimedium sagittatum<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Leaf<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">015<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bioperine (extract from Piper nigrum fruit)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">005<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Total amount</bold></td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center">720</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>With the accrued preclinical evidence, VigRx Plus demonstrated potential as a novel agent for management of ED.

The study was conducted at outpatient clinics of participating urologists and general physicians, from May 2009 to December 2009. The trial conduct was monitored to ensure compliance to the ethical principles of Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) - Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and IEC approved protocol. Independent quality assurance auditors verified the quality of the data generated from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Men aged 25&#x02013;50&#x02009;years, seeking treatment for sexual dysfunction, at the outpatient clinics of investigators, were offered participation in this study. The volunteers gave written informed consent before being assessed on the IIEF scale. Those with a score of 11&#x02013;23 on the EF domain of the IIEF were eligible. Major illnesses (including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and sexual dysfunction due to anatomical, surgical or pharmacological causes were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Subjects were randomized to receive VXP or placebo at a dose of 2 capsules twice daily (each capsule containing 360&#x02009;mg of active or placebo composition) for 12&#x02009;weeks. The randomization sequence was generated manually, in blocks of four, by drawing chits of paper from a bag, by a person not involved in the execution of the study or the analysis of its results. Investigator, patient and statistician were blinded to the random assignment. Randomization sequence was concealed in tamper-evident envelopes maintained in the custody of investigators. Envelope integrity was checked at each monitoring visit to ensure concealment of random allocation.</p><p>The study medications were indistinguishable in terms of appearance, weight and taste. Both active and placebo were packed in identical containers with identical labels carrying patient ID and treatment week as distinctive markers for dispensing and monitoring compliance. Use of any other substance or product for treatment of male sexual dysfunction was prohibited during the study. Prior use of conventional or alternative medicine required a wash out of 7 and 15&#x02009;days respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The IIEF questionnaire was used to evaluate the treatment effect on the sexual functioning in subjects of this study. The questionnaire described by Rosen <italic>et al.</italic> is a self-reported, validated instrument for measuring erectile dysfunction and monitoring response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It evaluates several aspects of sexual function over five important domains: Erectile Function (EF), Sexual Desire (SD), Orgasmic Function (OF), Intercourse satisfaction (IS), and Overall satisfaction (OS). The IIEF was administered at baseline and 4-week intervals.</p><p>Treatment satisfaction of subjects and their female partners was assessed through responses to the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire. Seminal parameters and serum testosterone levels were assessed at baseline and end of study. Safety was evaluated through incidence of adverse events, changes in laboratory parameters and subject&#x02019;s rating for tolerability of treatment. Subjects were also asked to declare whether they wished to continue with the trial medication. Additionally, at study end, investigators rated response to therapy as excellent, good, fair or poor.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis for safety was done on an intent-to-treat (ITT) population of subjects who received at least one dose and had at least a single post-baseline measurement. Efficacy analysis was done on a per protocol (PP) data set consisting of subjects completing all protocol-required visits. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS&#x000ae; for windows (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), True Epistat version 5.0; and MS Excel XP. Mean changes in IIEF-EF, IS,OF,SD and OS domains, and total IIEF scores from baseline to end of treatment were evaluated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline scores as the covariate. Data on EDITS (patient and partner versions), seminal parameters and serum testosterone were analyzed by independent sample <italic>t</italic> test. Chi-square test was used to analyze investigators&#x02019; global assessment and subject&#x02019;s opinion.

ED sufferers often seek alternatives, since many are reticent to express their sexual problems to physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], or are dissatisfied with current therapies. Even after restoration of erectile function, successful treatments have nevertheless been abandoned for such reasons as fear of possible side effects, aversion to drug-dependent erections, high drug cost, dislike of need to plan sexual activity, and lack of sexual interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The present study evaluated VigRX Plus, a poly-herbal supplement purported to offer natural sexual enhancement in men. The efficacy results of this first-in-human study were generally consistent with the effects demonstrated by VXP in animal experiments. VXP was found to be effective in improving the erectile function in men with sexual dysfunction. Statistically significant increases in IIEF scores showed that VXP had a therapeutic benefit that was superior to placebo. From the improvement displayed in all five domains of the IIEF (erection quality, sexual desire, orgasm quality, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction), it appears that VXP may help in enhancing the overall quality of sexual experience in men.</p><sec><title>Multi-herb combination: synergistic efficacy or compromised safety?</title><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Often, multi-herb supplements are formulated with the aim of achieving a net additive or synergistic effect of individual ingredients with similar clinical or pharmacological actions. Practitioners of traditional medicine believe that combinations of herbs improve efficacy and reduce adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. But whether such combinations synergize or even simulate the therapeutic action of their components remains largely unknown.</p><p>Among the herbal constituents of VXP, only Korean red ginseng has been previously evaluated on the IIEF scale, in two double-blind, randomized, controlled studies. Of the two, a similar study in 60 patients with mild to moderate ED showed an increase in the IIEF-five item scores from a baseline of 16.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9 to 21.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.3, after receiving 1000&#x02009;mg (3 times daily) of ginseng for 12&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The increase of 9 points in IIEF- EF with VXP in our study is comparable to the approximately 5-point increase in the ginseng study. In the other 45-patient study designed as cross-over, mean increases in IIEF scores in the Ginseng (900&#x02009;mg. 3 times daily) group were significantly higher than in those who received placebo (baseline 28.0 +/&#x02212; 16.7 and 38.1 +/&#x02212; 16.6 versus 30.9 +/&#x02212; 15.7, p &#x0003c;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In response to the global efficacy question, 60% of the patients answered that Korean red ginseng improved erection, which is in agreement with the 72% (26 out of 36) patients global response observed in our study.</p><p>The aphrodisiac properties of <italic>tribulus</italic> were demonstrated in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and in a human study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] where <italic>tribulus</italic> extract (3x250 mg/day for 3&#x02009;weeks) increased the sexual drive in 60% of diabetic and non-diabetic ED men.

Negative consequences associated with treatment, have been identified as important to patients receiving treatment for ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. VXP was apparently safe and well-tolerated in this study. This is consistent with the long history of safe use of herbs present in VXP. Contrary to the general belief, recent reports have questioned the safety of some herbs including <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> which has concerns over blood-thinning effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and ocular toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. That none of these adverse effects were reported for VXP is assuring; however, caution should be exercised while interpreting the safety results as they are not determined over the long-term.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ED: Through the patient&#x02019;s perspective</title><p>Unlike many other medical disorders, ED is a condition for which nobody other than the patient can decide upon a treatment option or interpret its success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Both patient and partner satisfaction are considered to be relevant to understanding and predicting treatment continuation in ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].The growing importance of patient choice in clinical decision-making is evident from several trials that have attempted to evaluate patient preference or treatment-switching patterns amongst available PDE-5 inhibitors: the first-line ED treatment. Long-term adherence to PDE-5 inhibitors seems to be low despite their high efficacy, good tolerability, and ease of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Our study primarily focused on obtaining the patients&#x02019; perspective on treatment success, mainly by employing patient-reported measures like the IIEF and EDITS. We found that improvements in sexual function recorded by IIEF were corroborated by patient and partner satisfaction, as evidenced by significantly greater EDITS (patient and partner) scores reported for VXP as compared to placebo. Additionally, subjects&#x02019; opinions and investigators&#x02019; rating were also in favor of VXP.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and future action</title><p>First of all, the study sought to examine the effects of VigRx Plus in young men who had no apparent co-morbid conditions. ED on the other hand, is recognized as a disorder of older adults suffering from systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The seemingly atypical patient characteristics limit the extrapolation of the clinical benefit of VXP to that in the presence of concurrent diseases and medications that are commonly seen in a larger ED population of older adults.</p><p>However, young patients reporting erectile difficulties are not unknown of. Heruti <italic>et al.</italic> reported that at least one out of three young men could be suffering from ED, emphasizing that this condition is a major health concern of the young as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Another study has observed that young men with ED have comparatively more difficulty in adjusting to life influenced by less relationship satisfaction, greater depressive symptomatology, more negative reaction from partners and less job satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Moreover, unlike the &#x02018;asexual older men&#x02019; who perceive ED as a normal and irreversible part of the ageing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], young men may find ED a serious impediment to an active and perfect sexual life, and are hence likely to seek help more often than their older counterparts.</p><p>Secondly, the study does not gather enough evidence to conclude whether the ED was of organic, psychogenic or mixed origin. Even in the absence of any detectable underlying condition or risk factor, an organic aetiology cannot be refuted as ED is known to share common endothelial dysfunction pathways with many vascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and manifests 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;years beforehand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] to serve as an early warning of such diseases, particularly in men 45&#x02009;years or younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Experts therefore recommend that physicians consider a man with ED and no cardiac symptoms as a cardiac or vascular patient until proved otherwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that vascular and other conditions though noticeably absent could have existed in a latent or subclinical phase when patients entered the study. Only long- term follow-up programs can help verify if ED had actually served as a predictor of vascular abnormalities in these patients.</p><p>Then again, we did not specifically rule out psychogenic ED by the use of psychometric assessments or by evaluating the intactness of sleep-time erections through nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity testing. Given that psychogenic ED should be confirmed only after ascertaining the presence of psychosocial factors as the predominant or exclusive cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], a definitive statement that the patients in our study were mainly suffering from psychogenic ED would remain unjustified. Future studies with VXP should aim at differentiating between various forms of ED in order to acquire a better understanding of the intervention in treating ED of diverse aetiology.</p><p>An intriguing finding of the study was the small sized placebo effect observed for patient reported outcomes. It is a clear departure from the usually observed placebo response rate of 25% (1 out of every 4 men benefits) in ED trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Here again, the finding suggests a preponderance of organic ED and also a tendency for non-response towards placebo. The fact that patients had a history of over two years of erectile difficulties before enrolling themselves for the study indicates that they were not treatment naive and had exhausted their placebo response to a new treatment option .The learning that occurs after experiencing the benefits and side effects (or the lack thereof) from a previous medication may have shaped patients&#x02019; expectations about a therapeutic effect, allowing them to decipher whether or not they received the active treatment during the study. This partly explains why patient responses in the placebo group were poor while those in the active group were comparable to that of pharmacological drugs for ED. However, considering the small sized placebo effect observed in this study, the results described should be viewed with caution. It may have benefited the treatment results as significantly better, even if minimal. In clinical trials of drug treatments, placebo responses have often been substantial, usually significantly and statistically better than no treatment (baseline).</p><p>Patient expectations could also be influenced by foreknowledge of the treatment assignment. Differences in color or size of pills can serve as cues in differentiating the active treatment from placebo to introduce a response bias. However, this possibility is eliminated from our study as the indistinguishable treatments and strict implementation of operational measures ensured adequate concealment of allocation sequence and prevented any lapses in the integrity of study blinding.</p><p>To summarize, results obtained from evaluation in young men with no overt organic causes may offer limited generalizability, nevertheless, represent an important subset of ED patients who are potentially amenable to therapy and at the same time are least likely to exhibit a placebo response that can confound the determination of active treatment effects. The study has set grounds for further evaluation of VXP in patients with well-recognized risk factors and distinctly identified forms of ED.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VigRX Plus was well-tolerated and effective in improving erectile function in men.
