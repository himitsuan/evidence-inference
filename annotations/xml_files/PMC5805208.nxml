Primary lymphedema is hereditary, whereas secondary lymphedema is mainly caused by surgical treatment of tumors, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, lymphatic obstruction, and chronic venous insufficiency.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> For this select group of patients, the lack of neuromuscular monitoring will lead to difficulties for anesthesiologists in terms of deciding whether to administer a supplementary dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent and determining the timing of administration. When the supplementary dose is administered based solely on past experience, it often results in prolonged action of the neuromuscular blocking agents, leading to side effects such as postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade.</p><p>Clinically, dosage calculation for neuromuscular blocking agents is based on the RBW and ED95. However, there is substantial interindividual variation in the response to neuromuscular blocking agents among patients with special body mass compositions. Therefore, evidence-based medicine has been increasingly proving the rationality of drug administration based on the corrected body weight in this special population. Although patients with lymphedema are not equivalent to obese patients, most are overweight, which will also affect the volume of distribution, plasma concentration, and elimination half-life of neuromuscular blocking agents.</p><p>Previous studies on the clinical application of neuromuscular blocking agents in obese patients have shown that changes in the pathophysiological functions and body mass composition of obese patients could affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs. Meyhoff et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> showed that calculation of the rocuronium dosage should be based on the ideal body weight of obese patients to avoid a prolonged onset time of neuromuscular blocking agents. Wang et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> found that while administration of rocuronium based on the body surface area did not reduce interindividual variations in the onset of neuromuscular blockade, the total drug dosage required was reduced. In contrast, Meyhoff et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> reported that administration of rocuronium based on the FFM achieved a clinical duration in obese patients similar to that in patients of normal body weight, while also reducing interindividual variation in pharmacodynamics among obese patients.</p><p>The target sites of neuromuscular blocking agents are located at the neuromuscular junctions, and the lean body mass determines the number of neuromuscular junctions.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, the pharmacological effect of a neuromuscular blocking agent is primarily dependent on its plasma concentration, which is closely associated with the blood volume. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are mainly distributed in the lean muscles because of their high water solubility and low fat solubility. Therefore, calculation of the administration dosage of these agents is more accurate and reasonable when based on the FFM than on the RBW.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Our study also showed that for patients with lymphedema, the FFM is a better body weight scalar than the RBW for the administration of rocuronium. The widely accepted Janmahasatian formula was applied to calculate the lean body weight in the present study. This formula allows for a more accurate calculation of the lean body weight of patients with lymphedema.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0300060517711085" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Substantial variations in lymphatic drainage occur before and after LVA and may affect the plasma protein volume and concentration. This is especially true for drugs with high fat solubility and may result in fluctuations in the drug plasma concentration. Research related to the lymphatic circulatory system is less advanced than that related to the blood circulatory system. We hope that further investigations will be conducted on the changes in the circulation steady state during LVA and lymphatic liposuction and their effects on drug concentrations and pharmacodynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec10-0300060517711085"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Good intubation conditions and a shortened clinical duration can be obtained for patients with lymphedema when induction with rocuronium is based on the FFM.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec15-0300060517711085"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Zhang Jing: patient selection and recruitment, statistical analysis, and writing of the manuscript.
