Mechanisms leading to the development of the various patterns of motor fluctuations are incompletely understood,<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> although there is evidence suggesting that pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia is involved.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Several pharmacological strategies have been used to achieve more sustained plasma LD concentrations to manage, and possibly avoid, motor fluctuations associated with oral LD. These include the use of extended-release (ER) LD formulations and inhibitors of catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In advanced PD, available adjunctive therapies can reduce &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time associated with LD therapy, which in some studies exceeds 6 hours per day. In placebo-controlled studies, dopaminergic agonists<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and inhibitors of MAO-B<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> have been shown to produce clinically meaningful reductions in &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time as measured by patient home diaries and improved scores in the activities of daily living (Part II) and motor examination scores (Part III) of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Amantadine, a nonspecific glutamate <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor antagonist, reduces the severity and duration of LD-induced dyskinesia.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> A Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of efficacy and safety studies investigated adjunct oral treatments for PD patients with motor complications who were on stable immediate-release (IR) oral LD regimens and found that dopaminergic agonists were more effective at controlling parkinsonian symptoms than catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase inhibitors or MAO-B inhibitors. The overall incidence of side effects was similar among the 3 groups.<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Current treatment guidelines reflect this conclusion.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Extended-release CD-LD (IPX066, RYTARY, NUMIENT; Impax Laboratories, Inc, Hayward, Calif) is an oral CD-LD formulation that combines IR and ER components with the goal of more sustained plasma LD concentrations.

Relative to each comparator and with all the concomitant medication subgroups, ER CD-LD was not associated with worsening of troublesome dyskinesia. Results of the UPDRS Parts II and III showed similar trends to findings from the PD diary in favor of ER CD-LD. Extended-release CD-LD treatment consistently improved scores compared with IR CD-LD and CLE; however, the numerical improvement was not statistically significant in patients receiving a MAO-B inhibitor or amantadine.</p><p>The final dose ratio of preconversion and postconversion to ER CD-LD from IR CD-LD were all 2.0 to 2.1, whereas from CLE the ratio was 2.7 to 2.9 for the subgroups except for the amantadine group, where the ratio was 2.5.</p><p>Studies have shown that dopaminergic agonists<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and MAO-B inhibitors<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> are effective as monotherapy for the control of motor symptoms. However, their effectiveness in patients with advanced PD has been examined only as adjunct therapies to LD. These drug classes can improve UPDRS Parts II and III scores and reduce the amount of &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Thus, it is conceivable that differences in the efficacy of ER CD-LD versus IR CD-LD or CLE found in the ADVANCE-PD and ASCEND-PD trials may have been lessened in those patients who received concomitant dopaminergic agonist or MAO-B inhibitor therapy. Our analysis shows the opposite; namely, improvements in PD diary measures afforded by ER CD-LD versus IR CD-LD or CLE were not diminished by the concomitant administration of these classes of medication. Differences in UPDRS Parts II and III scores were statistically significant only in the ADVANCE-PD trial in patients receiving a concomitant dopaminergic agonist. Explanations for this observation may be related to the smaller overall change in UPDRS scores in the ASCEND-PD trial compared with improvements in ADVANCE-PD (due possibly to the shorter treatment duration). In addition, the between-treatment-groups differences in UPDRS II + III were relatively small compared with those observed in the patient diary measures, so when the study was subdivided, it should not be surprising that the statistical significance of some of the subgroup differences had declined.</p><p>Amantadine is commonly prescribed as a mild antiparkinsonian medication or as an adjunctive therapy to treat tremor or LD-induced dyskinesia,<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and it has also been shown to reduce &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time.<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Concomitant use of amantadine with ER CD-LD produced a numerical decrease in &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time and an increase in &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; time without troublesome dyskinesia compared with IR CD-LD, but this difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.5 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.65, respectively). This may be due to inherent differences in those patients who require amantadine treatment for their dyskinesia such that it affects their LD response or may reflect the smaller sample size of the subgroups compared with the dopaminergic agonist subgroups.</p><p>The overall safety profile was not altered by the use of concomitant medications.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Dyskinesia is a well documented adverse effect of all dopaminergic therapies.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the present study, there was an increased incidence of dyskinesia (reported as an AE) with ER CD-LD for those taking concomitant dopaminergic agonists and selegiline or rasagiline compared with prior regimens of IR CD-LD and CLE. However, the overall reporting rates for dyskinesia were low and did not translate into a significant increase in &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; time with troublesome dyskinesia (per patient diaries) for either of these concomitant therapies.</p><p>A limitation of the present analysis is that some of the patients may have received more than 1 class of concomitant therapy. Thus, the effects observed by one class may not be independent of the effects caused by the others and may be the result of interactions between the different classes. However, limiting patient selection to those given only 1 of the 3 classes used in the present analysis may have yielded sample sizes too low to allow for conclusions to be drawn.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of a concomitant dopaminergic agonist or MAO-B inhibitor did not diminish the efficacy of ER CD-LD compared with IR CD-LD or CLE, whereas the improvement observed with concomitant amantadine failed to reach statistical significance. Treatment with ER CD-LD also did not increase troublesome dyskinesia compared with IR CD-LD or CLE for any of the studied subgroups. Safety and tolerability were similar among the patient subgroups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>These studies were funded by Impax Laboratories, Inc.
