The size and negative lymph node status characteristics of invasive cancers from the two populations were significantly different (P less than 0.05). The cancers detected by screening were predominantly 'early stage', with 16% noninvasive (PTIS) and 42% invasive stage I (pT1 node negative), whereas cancers were frequently 'late stage' (more than pT2) and inoperable in nonattenders (44%) and controls (36%). Grouped according to customary size ranges of invasive cancers, the proportion of cases lymph node positive differed in those screen detected compared with controls, but the benefit in favour of screen detection was not constant. In comparisons of cancers detected at prevalence and incidence screens, as a test of conformity with screening theory, no significant differences were apparent according to size and lymph node status, yet the characteristics of histological type of cancer discriminated significantly (P less than 0.05). When these same histological characteristics were used to compare survival, the capacity to separate invasive cancers into two groups having good and poor survival probabilities was evident, with a significant improvement for the screen detected poor survival group compared with controls (P less than 0.05).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="108" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="109" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="110" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="111" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="112" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00071-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="113" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
