Osteoporosis with low bone mineral density (BMD) puts older people who fall at high risk of sustaining fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A first hip fracture is associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of a subsequent fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A population-based study among people aged 85&#x000a0;years or older showed that 21% of those with a hip fracture had suffered at least two hip fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Previous research has identified several fall risk factors such as comorbidity, functional disability, previous falls, and use of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but also aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and among the oldest old, male sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Delirium, which is very common after hip fracture surgery, especially among those with a cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], has been found to be one of the most important risk factors for falls among older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Multi factorial intervention strategies among community-living older people can prevent falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and are the recommendations in fall prevention interventions nowadays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The recommendations in fall prevention programs is that they should include gait training, advice on use of assistive devices, medication reviews, exercise programs including balance training, treatment of hypotension, environmental modification, and treatment of cardiovascular disorders. In long-term care the program recommends also to include staff education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Most fall prevention studies are performed in the community, but multidisciplinary and multifactorial interventions have also been shown to be beneficial in residential care facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Few fall prevention studies have been carried out in hospitals; there have been a few studies with single interventions among older patients in rehabilitation units, without any significant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently two studies, one using multiple interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and one using a multidisciplinary fall prevention approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], have demonstrated a reduction in falls. None of these fall prevention studies have focused on hip fracture patients or tried to reduce postoperative complications as a fall prevention measure.</p><p>Considering the lack of fall prevention studies in hospitals, especially after recent hip fracture surgery, this is an area of interest for study. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate if a postoperative multidisciplinary, multifactorial intervention program could reduce inpatient falls and fall-related injuries in patients with femoral neck fractures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p>This study included patients with femoral neck fracture aged &#x02265;70&#x000a0;years, consecutively admitted to the orthopedic department at the Ume&#x000e5; University Hospital, Sweden, between May 2000 and December 2002, and the study was designed according to the CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>In Sweden different surgery methods are used depending on the displacement of the femoral neck fracture. In the present study patients with undisplaced fracture were operated on using internal fixation (IF) and patients with displaced fracture were operated on using hemiarthroplasty (HAP). If patients had severe rheumatoid arthritis, severe hip osteoarthritis, or pathological fracture they were excluded, by the surgeon on duty, because of the need for a different surgery method, such as total hip arthroplasty (THA). Patients with severe renal failure were excluded, by the anesthesiologist, because of their morbidity. Patients being bedridden before the fracture occurred were also excluded.</p><p>In the emergency room the patients were asked both in writing and orally if they were willing to participate in the study. The next of kin was always asked prior to the inclusion in patients with cognitive impairment. The patients or their next of kin could at any time decline participation. A total of 258 patients met the inclusion criteria; 11 patients declined to participate and 48 patients were not invited to participate because they had sustained the fracture in the hospital or the inclusion routines failed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These 59 patients were more likely to be men (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033) and living in their own house/apartment (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009), but there was no difference in age (<italic>p</italic>=0.354) compared to the participating patients. The remaining 199 patients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) consented to participate. All patients received the same preoperative treatment. </p><p>Patients were randomized, to postoperative care in a geriatric ward with a special intervention program or to conventional care in an orthopedic ward, in opaque sealed envelopes. The lots in the envelopes were sequentially numbered. All participants received this envelope while in the emergency room but the envelope was not opened until immediately before surgery to ensure that all patients received similar preoperative treatment. Persons not involved in the study performed these procedures. </p><p>The randomization was stratified according to the operation methods used in the study. Depending on the degree of dislocation, the patients were treated with IF using two hook-pins (Swemac Ortopedica, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden) (<italic>n</italic>=38 intervention vs <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31 control) or with bipolar hemiarthroplasty (Link, Hamburg, Germany) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57 vs 54). Basocervical fractures (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7 vs 10) were operated on using a dynamic hip screw (DHS, Stratec Medical, Oberdorf, Switzerland) and one had a resection of the femoral head due to a deterioration in medical status and one died before surgery (both were in the control group).

Second, the fall incidence rate was compared between intervention and control groups by calculating the fall incidence rate ratio (IRR) using a negative binomial regression, with adjustment for observation time and for overdispersion.

A multidisciplinary, multifactorial geriatric care program with systematic assessment and treatment of fall risk factors as well as active prevention, detection, and treatment of other postoperative complications resulted in fewer patients who fell, a lower total number of falls, and fewer injuries.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first fall intervention study in this group of patients, despite the fact that this is a group of patients with a high fall risk. In general there are few fall prevention studies in hospital settings. Two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] with positive outcomes in other patient groups and on subacute wards have recently been published. The first one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reduced falls at three subacute rehabilitation wards, but the differences were most obvious after 45&#x000a0;days of observation. Thus the results were not comparable with those from the present study, which included both the acute and rehabilitation hospital stay. The other study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] resulted in fewer fallers, falls, and injuries on a geriatric ward but the differences disappeared when the results were adjusted for observation time. Those studies used a multidisciplinary approach in their fall intervention similar to that used in the present study, but in the present study we have, in addition, focused on inpatient complications associated with falls such as delirium and urinary tract infections. One of those studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] tried to manage the delirious patients using bedrails, alarms, and changing the furniture arrangements for the patients, but no mention was made of any prevention and treatment of the underlying causes of delirium. The use of physical restraints was not included in the intervention program in the present study. The studies above used fall risk assessment tools to recognize those with a high fall risk. In the present study, we used a rehabilitation and care program including assessment of risk factors for falls and global ratings for each patient during team meetings. A critique of fall risk assessment tools is that few have been tested for validity and reliability testing in a new independent sample. When using fall prediction tools in different clinical settings the specificity decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>A limitation in the present study is that some falls could have been missed, but we presume that there were very few. For one thing the nurses are obliged to document falls in the records. Also hip fracture surgery patients can hardly get up by themselves after a fall so soon after the surgery and are, therefore, bound to be noticed; but if there were any missing falls there would probably be no difference between the groups. Another limitation is that the fall registration could not be blinded regarding group allocation, but the staffs on each ward were not aware of the comparison with another ward regarding falls and injuries. The study sample is also quite small, but the sample size is calculated according to the results from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The method of concealment could have been improved, but one strength was that none from the research team performed this procedure and the envelopes were not opened until the intervention was to begin. Other strengths were the intention to treat analyses, the few patients who refused to participate, and that there were no crossover effects due to staff changing wards during the study period.</p><p>One may speculate that the successful reduction in number of falls in the present study could be a result of the active prevention, detection, and treatment of postoperative complications after surgery. During the period of hospitalization there were differences between the groups regarding some complications associated with falls among older people in residential care facilities and in hospitals, such as delirium and urinary tract infections. The reduction of postoperative delirium can probably explain much of the difference between the groups regarding the numbers of falls and the number of patients who fell. There are studies that have found that delirium is an important risk factor for falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Demented patients especially are at high risk of developing delirium when they are treated for femoral neck fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and these patients seemed to have benefited most in this study from the intervention program regarding prevention of postoperative falls. Our findings support an earlier non-randomized study that fewer injurious falls occur when the incidence and duration of delirium was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The investigation into why the patients had fractured their hip and why they fell may also have influenced the result, as well as the investigation and rehabilitation concerning external fall risk factors such as the use of walking aids, safe transfers, balance, and mobility. It seems that teamwork and individual care planning alone do not have the same effect on falls, as half the falls in the control group occurred in the geriatric control ward, a ward specializing in geriatric patients where teamwork, as well as individual care planning, is applied.</p><p>In the community and residential care facilities, interdisciplinary and multifactorial fall prevention studies have shown positive effects on the reduction in the number of falls and injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Among those with cognitive decline or dementia there is no evidence that such strategies prevent falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but the present study allowed the conclusion that at least during the in-hospital stay, this group of patients could benefit from such strategies. The reduced number of falls and injuries also probably contributed to the shorter hospitalization seen in the intervention group. The program seems easy applicable both in the acute postoperative care as well in the post-acute rehabilitation settings and except for the staff education there were no increased costs.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A team applying comprehensive geriatric assessment and rehabilitation, including prevention, detection, and treatment of fall risk factors, can successfully prevent inpatient falls and injuries, even in patients with dementia.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Acknowledgements</bold> The authors wish to thank all the patients and the staff at the orthopedic and geriatric departments at the university hospital in Ume&#x000e5;.
