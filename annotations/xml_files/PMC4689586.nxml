Chronic persistent stress has been linked to suppressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections and cancer [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while acute stress induces a fight-or-flight reaction, tuned to rapidly respond to injury and subsequent entry of infectious agents into the organism. Acute stress-induced changes in the immune system thus plausibly aim at accelerating wound repair, help prevent infections, and should occur very rapidly [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to adaptive immunity, the innate immune response is optimized to immediately respond to pathogens without need for prior cognate exposure. Natural Killer (NK) cells represent 5&#x02013;15% of all lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and are important in the defense against viruses and tumors. Based on their CD56 surface expression-density they can by divided into cytotoxic CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells (roughly 90%), and the immunomodulatory CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells (approximately 10% of NK in the peripheral blood). Circulating cytotoxic CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells detect virally infected or malignantly transformed cells. Their activation results in target cell lysis and the secretion of cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous studies found a strong increase of circulating NK cells upon stress, suggesting a potential role for NK cells in this context [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Stress hormones, including glucocorticoids and catecholamines, are key modulators of stress-induced immune-dysregulation [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145635.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, inter-individual differences in the endocrine responses often hinder subtle stress-associated immunologic alterations to become apparent. Thus, a well-controlled experimental model triggering a homogeneous endocrine stress response should allow to better study how stress impacts the immune system.</p><p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &#x0201c;ecstasy&#x0201d;) and methylphenidate (MPH, &#x0201c;Ritalin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x0201d;) are widely used psychoactive substances that induce an endocrine and cardiovascular stress response that has been extensively studied [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous murine and human studies suggested that MDMA impacts both the innate and the adaptive immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Data regarding the effect of MPH on the immune system are sparse. Both drugs result in an increase in norepinephrine levels, i.e. have sympathomimetic effects. While MDMA enhances serotonergic neurotransmission [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and increases cortisol levels [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], MPH elevates dopamine concentrations but has no serotonergic effects [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and does not increase cortisol levels [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, both MDMA and MPH share sympathomimetic and psychostimulant effects, yet with distinct hormone profiles.</p><p>Here we used drug-induced stress to test its effects on the human immune system.

Drugs were taken orally. Washout periods between two conditions were at least 10 days. All blood draws were performed via an indwelling intravenous catheter placed in an antecubital vein and the baseline blood draw was at 8 am for all study subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using Lymphoprep<sup>TM</sup> (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) density centrifugation and cryopreserved until use, in order to be able to measure all study timepoints (i.e. conditions) for each subject on the same day.

MDMA, MPH, and the combination of the two drugs induced an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate peaking three hours after drug administration (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref></bold>). Details to the cardiovascular response in the study subjects have been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The MDMA/MPH combination induced the strongest increase in SBP, and MPH alone induced a SBP increase of lower magnitude than the conditions that included MDMA (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Contrarily, the heart rate was highest in treatment conditions including MPH (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Since these differences might be linked to different stress hormone profiles induced by the different treatments, levels of cortisol and catecholamines were analyzed and compared with levels measured in placebo treated study subjects. Hormone levels two hours after drug administration (i.e. at their peak) were compared to the baseline blood draws, which were all performed at 8 am. All active drug conditions resulted in a comparable, albeit non-significant increase of norepinephrine at 2 hours (<italic>data not shown</italic>). The most striking difference between the drug conditions was an increase in cortisol concentration upon exposure to MDMA (p &#x0003c; 0.001) or MDMA/MPH (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) compared to placebo or MPH alone (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Cortisol levels fell in the placebo and MPH condition, consistent with known circadian changes in cortisol, given the timing of the blood draws, all starting at 8 am [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The increase in epinephrine concentrations was higher in individuals exposed to MDMA/MPH (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) than in those exposed to MDMA alone (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and lowest in participants after MPH intake alone, suggesting an additive effect of MDMA and MPH on the epinephrine stress response (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref></bold>). The cardiovascular stress response (i.e. HR increase and SBP increase) correlated with both, the epinephrine (HR: p = 0.0035, r = 0.42; SBP: p = 0.0001, r = 0.53), and cortisol increase (HR: p = 0.0001, r = 0.53; SBP p&#x0003c;0.0001, r = 0.71). Together, the findings suggest that the study conditions resulted in distinct cardiovascular and endocrine stress response profiles.</p><fig id="pone.0145635.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145635.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Drug-induced stress induces a pronounced cardiovascular responses and NK cell recruitment.</title><p>(A) Systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mmHg and (B) heart rate (HR) in beats per minute (bpm) are shown three hours (i.e. one hour after the stress hormone peak) post-adminstration of the study drug (n = 12).

To enable an immediate response to any threat it is plausible that early stress-induced adaptations act through cell redistribution, and preferentially impact innate immunity that can unfold much more rapidly [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145635.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Because this rapidly occurring redistribution of lymphocyte subsets suggested stress hormone-mediated effects, we next correlated stress hormone levels (2 hours post administration) with the individual NK cell increase, irrespective of the treatment.

Dopamine was only very weakly (median 0.03 nmol/L, IQR -0.03&#x02013;0.09) and inconstantly increased following any drug administration and the change in dopamine levels showed no correlation with the change in NK cell frequencies (data not shown). Similarly, we found no correlation between drug induced neuropsychological effects -namely changes in activity or emotional excitability- and NK cell redistribution. Taken together, this hinted at a more pronounced role of epinephrine in NK cell redistribution.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Stress enriches for circulating cytotoxic NK cells with unaltered effector functions and activation state</title><p>Given their strong relative increase upon drug-induced stress, we performed a more detailed analysis of the specific NK cell subsets and their functionality. Although both cytotoxic (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) and immunomodulatory (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) NK cell subsets increased, the most pronounced effect was detected for CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells upon the combined drug stimulation (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). This indicated that CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells were recruited preferentially upon stress. The stronger correlation between the change in CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells and the alteration in epinephrine levels (p = 0.004, r = 0.45, <bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>), as compared to the correlation with change in cortisol levels (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>,</bold> p = 0.041, r = 0.31), further supported this notion.

This decrease was limited to CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells, and NKG2D on bulk T cells was slightly increased (<italic>data not shown</italic>).

Yet, this NK cell inhibition was independent of NKG2D expression, as NKG2D was only reduced inconstantly (i.e. six of eleven healthy donors) and showed no correlation with NK function. Moreover, a reduction in NK function was also observed against 721.221 target cells not expressing NKG2D ligands (data not shown). Together, this indicates that the NKG2D<sup>low</sup> phenotype results from mobilization of these NK cells rather than from a receptor down-modulation by direct hormone effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Inherent expression differences of key surface receptors may explain preferential recruitment of CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells</title><p>Our immunophenotypic data suggested that drug-induced stress associated with the preferential recruitment of cytotoxic NK cells without substantially affecting their function. Thus, we next aimed at defining molecular differences between CD56<sup>dim</sup> and CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell subsets that may explain the preferential recruitment of the CD56<sup>dim</sup> subset. First, we assessed the expression-profile of receptors previously linked to epinephrine-mediated lymphocyte redistribution, namely high expression of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 and low expression of CD62L [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], in five healthy untreated individuals. The flow cytometry gating strategies are shown in the supporting information (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref></bold>).

This expression profile was inverse in the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset (CX3CR1, p &#x0003c; 0.0001; CD62L, p = 0.001). In contrast, CD18, an integrin known to bind to ICAMs and thereby enhancing NK cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was slightly more expressed on the CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK subset (p = 0.008, <bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Next, we assessed mRNA and protein levels of the &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) and glucocorticoid receptor (GCR), i.e. the receptor for epinephrine and cortisol respectively, in the two NK cell subsets. Both qPCR- and flow cytometry-based quantification indicated higher expression of the ADRB2 among CD56<sup>dim</sup>, compared to the CD56<sup>bright</sup>, NK cells (p = 0.019 for MFI, <bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>).

Taking advantage of the distinct hormone changes induced by the different drug conditions (<bold><xref rid="pone.0145635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref></bold>), epinephrine effects were analyzed by correlating the change in NK cells and altered ADRB2 expression in the presence (MDMA or MDMA/MPH group) or absence (MPH) of a concomitant cortisol increase. We found a very strong correlation between an increase of NK cells and ADRB2 expression in the MPH group (p = 0.02, r = 0.86), i.e. in absence of a cortisol response.

This is in line with a model of selective catecholamine-dependent regulation of NK cell adhesion to the endothelia [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as supported by studies using beta-adrenergic blockade suggesting catecholamines as master regulators of early stress effects on the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stress was observed to induce an enrichment of CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells in the peripheral blood, which associated with a strong epinephrine response. These NK cells expressed a receptor profile that would enable them to rapidly re-distribute to a site of injury or infection, where this cytotoxic subset could contribute to pathogen defense and wound healing. Differences in hormone receptor expression might explain differences in the magnitude of individual stress responses. The insights gained from this controlled clinical trial setting, using standardized stressors that consistently induced distinct stress hormone profiles, support that, in humans, NK cells can be recruited through epinephrine dependent mechanisms, which may be beneficial e.g. in leukemia or cancer therapy [<xref rid="pone.0145635.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
