The 21st century enabled us to live in improved living conditions. However, although our health status changed, many chronic stages of diseases were integrated into our lives.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Physical inactivity is one of the risk factors of atherosclerosis and obesity,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and may even be the most important. There is now overwhelming evidence that regular physical activity has important and wide-ranging health benefits. These range from reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers to enhance function and preservation of function with age.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Existing research shows that proper physical exercise, a healthy environment and balanced nutrition,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and good state of mind is an effective factor for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD).</p><p>Atherosclerosis leads to the narrowing of the lumen of coronary arteries. Eventually, progressive plaque thickening and/or rupture may lead to angina and/or myocardial infarction (MI).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> In the United States, the prevalence of CHD is about 6.2% in people &#x02265;20 years old.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> The rates of major cardiovascular events are higher in developing countries compared with developed ones.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Mortality from ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with 12.7% of the total mortality in 2008.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors; this enzyme normally catalyzes the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Therefore, statins induce cholesterol depletion within the hepatocytes, leading to the upregulation of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in order to obtain cholesterol from blood LDL particles.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Statins also decrease C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, but their effect on inflammation is not consistent.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Statins are the drugs of choice for patients at risk of CHD or CHD progression.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Statins significantly reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality and major coronary events as compared to control in both secondary and primary prevention. Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than pravastatin (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43&#x02013;0.99) and simvastatin (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.38&#x02013;0.98) for secondary prevention of major coronary events.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Atorvastatin is a 3rd-generation statin with a good efficacy and adequate safety profile.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>Nevertheless, statins are associated with adverse effects such as myopathy, hepatic toxicity, hyperglycemia, and impaired steroid production; rhabdomyolysis and death are also possible.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The risk of adverse effects increases with the higher doses.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality among individuals with clinical history of CHD. However, it remains uncertain whether statins have similar mortality benefit in a high-risk primary prevention setting. One literature-based meta-analysis did not find evidence for the benefit of statin therapy on all-cause mortality in a high-risk primary prevention set-up.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> The findings suggest that intensive dose atorvastatin therapy does not attenuate the progression of coronary calcification compared with standard dose atorvastatin therapy over 12 months.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>Chinese medicine has been regarded as a kind of complementary therapies in the Western countries. However, it has been one of the mainstream therapies in some Asian countries, such as Taiwan, Korea, and China, including acupuncture, moxibustion, Chinese orthopedics and traumatology, and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM).<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> CHM has a long history and is widely used in the prevention and treatment of a variety of diseases worldwide. CHM has been used to treat stroke for thousands of years. The findings suggest that bioactive components of CHM may improve neurological function, reduce infarct volume, and promote endogenous neurogenesis, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neural stem cells after ischemic stroke.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Zhibitai is a traditional Chinese medicine that is made of naturally occurring statins and it is used to treat blood lipid disorders. Previous studies have shown that zhibitai was comparable to atorvastatin in terms of lipid-lowering and antiinflammatory effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Therefore, zhibitai could be an appropriate alternative to chemical lipid-lowering drugs.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to further evaluate the lipid-lowering effect, antiinflammatory effect, and adverse events of zhibitai combined to atorvastatin 10&#x0200a;mg in patients with CHDs, and to investigate the advantages of the combination compared with higher doses of atorvastatin.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This was a prospective study of patients with CHD treated at the Inpatient and Outpatient Departments of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and at the Peace Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College (Shanxi, China) between October 2010 and May 2011.

The results showed that TG, TC, LDL-C, and ApoB<sub>100</sub> levels were decreased in the ZA10 group to a similar extent than in the A40 group. The levels of CT-1 and hs-CRP were significantly decreased in the ZA10 group after 4 and 8 weeks, without difference among the 3 groups. The incidence of adverse events (abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and hunger) in the ZA10 group was lower compared with the A20 and A40 groups.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that zhibitai used alone could lower blood lipids and inflammatory factors (including hs-CRP and CT-1).<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> The present study showed that the combined use of zhibitai and atorvastatin 10&#x0200a;mg could achieve a clinical efficacy comparable to that of higher doses of atorvastatin, without additional adverse effects. In the present study, the extent of TG lowering was higher than that of TC lowering when using zhibitai. As the majority of Asian patients with hyperlipidemia are mainly with increased TG,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> zhibitai could be more appropriate for patients with mixed hyperlipidemia characterized by increased TG. In addition, zhibitai combined to atorvastatin could achieve even better lipid-lowering effects. Therefore, technically, zhibitai could be suitable for Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that increased serum hs-CRP levels are closely associated with CHD and can be used to evaluate the patients&#x02019; condition and stability.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> CT-1 is a member of the IL-6 family.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Many recent studies have demonstrated that CT-1 is closely associated with the development and progression of CHD.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Increased CT-1 levels are found in patients with CHD and are associated with disease severity. The present study showed that the combined use of zhibitai and atorvastatin significantly reduced CT-1 and hs-CRP levels in patients with CHD.</p><p>In the present study, there were no significant increases in CK, myopathy, and distinct liver and renal damage in the ZA10 group compared with the A20 or A40 groups, but the number of events was low, preventing any reliable statistical analyses. Nevertheless, previous studies of zhibitai showed a low occurrence of adverse effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup></p><p>The present study is not without limitations. Indeed, the sample size was small and from only 2 hospitals. There were no differences among the groups at 8 weeks, and a noninferiority trial should be performed to confirm this equivalence. Further multicenter prospective trials are necessary to reach firm conclusions about the value of zhibitai for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.</p><p>In conclusion, ZA10 in patients with CHD significantly reduced TG, TC, LDL-C, and ApoB levels, as well as the inflammatory cytokines CT-1 and hs-CRP. These changes were similar to those achieved using A40 and A20, but ZA10 led to fewer adverse events.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>As the number of cases in this study is small, the observation time is not long enough, so the data and results are one-sided. This will be improved in future research work. The study is only a 1st sign of possible positive influence of herbal therapy, and further studies in the future are necessary to show positive effects on mortality and cardiac events like myocardial infarction or cardiac sudden death. This is the focus of our study work in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81672264, 81372117) for the support.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CHD = coronary heart disease, ZA10 = zhibitai 480 mg + atorvastatin 10 mg, A20 = atorvastatin 20 mg, A40 = atorvastatin 40 mg, CT-1 = cardiotrophin-1, CRP = C-reactive protein, hs-CRP = high sensitivity-C reactive protein, TC = total cholesterol, LDL = low-density lipoprotein, LDL-C = LDL-cholesterol, ApoB<sub>100</sub> = apolipoprotein B<sub>100</sub>, MI = myocardial infarction, CHM = Chinese herbal medicine.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81672264, 81372117).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leischik</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dworrak</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Strauss</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
