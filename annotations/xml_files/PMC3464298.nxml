In other contexts, anxiety and its concomitant symptoms of sympathetic nervous system arousal have been successfully ameliorated with HRV biofeedback (HRV BF), a technique involving slow breathing which augments autonomic and emotional regulatory capacity. <italic>Objective:</italic> This randomised-controlled study explored the impact of a single 30-minute session of HRV BF on anxiety in response to a highly stressful music performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 46 trained musicians participated in this study and were randomly allocated to a slow breathing with or without biofeedback or no-treatment control group. A 3 Group&#x000d7;2 Time mixed experimental design was employed to compare the effect of group before and after intervention on performance anxiety (STAI-S) and frequency domain measures of HRV.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Slow breathing groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30) showed significantly greater improvements in high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio measures of HRV relative to control (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) during 5 minute recordings of performance anticipation following the intervention (effect size: &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.122 and &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.116, respectively). The addition of biofeedback to a slow breathing protocol did not produce differential results. While intervention groups did not exhibit an overall reduction in self-reported anxiety, participants with high baseline anxiety who received the intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) displayed greater reductions in self-reported state anxiety relative to those in the control condition (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) (<italic>r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>0.379).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings indicate that a single session of slow breathing, regardless of biofeedback, is sufficient for controlling physiological arousal in anticipation of psychosocial stress associated with music performance and that slow breathing is particularly helpful for musicians with high levels of anxiety.

Musicians work in a highly competitive environment, where negative evaluation by peers, reviewers and audience members is part of the vocation <xref rid="pone.0046597-Steptoe2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Inability to perform due to anxiety can lead to missed opportunities and loss of income. Given these factors, it is not surprising that a large number of performing musicians rely on pharmacological aids (such as beta-adrenergic antagonists), often without prescription <xref rid="pone.0046597-Wesner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> which can lead to adverse mood states <xref rid="pone.0046597-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Head1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

It has been associated with reductions in anxiety symptoms <xref rid="pone.0046597-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Zucker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and improved cognitive performance <xref rid="pone.0046597-Prinsloo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is an index of beat to beat changes in heart rate and is a psychophysiological marker for physical and mental health <xref rid="pone.0046597-Porges1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046597-Zulfiqar1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

High HRV has a protective effect and is associated with good health <xref rid="pone.0046597-Karemaker1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and well-being <xref rid="pone.0046597-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>High frequency (HF) HRV reflects the magnitude of PNS influence on HR associated with breathing &#x02013; respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) <xref rid="pone.0046597-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> &#x02013; which is carried to the heart via the tenth cranial (vagus) nerve. Power spectral analysis partitions the observed variability into components of high (HF), low (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) using spectral decomposition, most commonly a Fast Fourier Transformation <xref rid="pone.0046597-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. PNS, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and blood pressure mechanisms operate on different time scales, so each of these components is thought to be associated with different sources of variability <xref rid="pone.0046597-Pumprla1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The HF component (between 0.15&#x02013;0.4 Hz) is known to be PNS mediated <xref rid="pone.0046597-Berntson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046597-Lopes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, while the LF component (0.04&#x02013;0.15 Hz) reflects a combination of PNS and SNS activity <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lane1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> via baroreflex function <xref rid="pone.0046597-Pumprla1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As a consequence, the LF/HF ratio is thought to provide information about the relationship of vagal input to the other sources of variability <xref rid="pone.0046597-Malliani1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Higher levels of resting state HF HRV may indicate increased ability to inhibit SNS-mediated arousal <xref rid="pone.0046597-Gevirtz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, leading to increased behavioural flexibility <xref rid="pone.0046597-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> in the face of stress and reduced anxiety, as argued by Thayer and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thayer2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046597-Thayer4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as worry, lead to acute reductions in HRV <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thayer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> whereas social approach behaviors are associated with increased parasympathetic activity, which is facilitated by an increase in vagal tone <xref rid="pone.0046597-Porges2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Porges <xref rid="pone.0046597-Porges1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> argues that human social engagement is enabled by a functional network of facial, vocal and cardiac cranial nerves, including the vagus. Inhibition of threat-related systems associated with anxiety is dependent upon fast-acting, bi-directional communication between visceral organs and brainstem nuclei via the vagus nerve. Rapid modulations of arousal through vagal mechanisms support adaptive emotion regulation by helping adjust emotions to their context <xref rid="pone.0046597-Appelhans1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Anxiety is related to an individual&#x02019;s ability to employ appropriate emotion regulation strategies <xref rid="pone.0046597-CampbellSills1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046597-Mennin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, thus, improving HRV levels may help to alleviate anxiety.</p><p>Physiological processes, such as breathing and HR, are directly involved in emotion regulation during music performance. Disruption to habitual breathing patterns appear to have a bidirectional relationship with anxiety <xref rid="pone.0046597-Wilhelm1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Studer et al. <xref rid="pone.0046597-Studer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> found that highly anxious individuals reported more hyperventilation prior to music performance. In contrast, slow, deep breathing can have remarkably beneficial effects, lowering blood pressure <xref rid="pone.0046597-Joseph1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, increasing blood-oxygen concentration and perhaps altering baroreflex function <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bernardi1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Slow breathing causes large increases in RSA amplitude <xref rid="pone.0046597-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Bernardi et al. <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bernardi2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> found slow breathing in simulated altitude reduced SNS activation under hypoxic stress and that those who regularly practice slow yogic breathing displayed a greater SNS inhibition under stress. Interestingly, slow breathing is found in disparate meditative traditions <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bernardi3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. It should be noted here that while clinically intriguing, the precise autonomic and regulatory mechanisms provoked by slow breathing are poorly understood. While there is undoubtedly a baroreflex component to 0.1 Hz breathing, baroreflex sensitivity does not show immediate provocation to the modified Oxford method of cardiovagal baroreflex assessment <xref rid="pone.0046597-Tzeng1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of HRV BF is to slow the breathing (normally &#x0223c;15 breaths per minute) to coincide with HRV changes due to the baroreflex (&#x0223c;6 cycles per minute, or 0.1 hz) resulting in what is known as resonant frequency <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, resulting in a large multiplicative increase in the amplitude of HR oscillations and HRV power. Each individual has a resonant frequency <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> usually achieved at around 6 breaths per minute <xref rid="pone.0046597-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. HRV BF involves training in abdominal breathing techniques, establishment of resonant frequency and monitoring over 10 weeks with home practice <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. It has been linked to improvements in PTSD symptoms <xref rid="pone.0046597-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Zucker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, depression <xref rid="pone.0046597-Siepmann1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046597-Hassett1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, state anxiety <xref rid="pone.0046597-Siepmann1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thurber1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0046597-DelPozo1" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0046597-Swanson1" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0046597-Cowan1" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and HRV levels <xref rid="pone.0046597-DelPozo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Zucker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Siepmann1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thurber1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. However, many of these studies used either no control group <xref rid="pone.0046597-Karavidas1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Hassett1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, fail to control for experimenter contact <xref rid="pone.0046597-DelPozo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thurber1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, or introduce HRV BF along with emotion regulation strategies without controlling for the effects of these additional strategies <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thurber1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, highlighting the need for further research. When used in conjunction with cognitive treatments, HRV BF may improve emotion regulation capacity and thereby maximise the benefits of psychotherapy in treating anxiety <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.</p><p>A laboratory test designed to probe the nature of anxious response to performance must produce a period of anxious apprehension prior to performance, and potential for negative evaluation. Responses to this challenge can be measured using both HRV and self report measures. If biofeedback is effective in reducing anxiety, then vagal withdrawal and self reported anxiety should be reduced after receiving HRV BF. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) <xref rid="pone.0046597-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> is an established, standardised procedure recognised for producing physiological arousal in laboratory conditions <xref rid="pone.0046597-Shirotsuki1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> in response to the psychosocial stress of performing in front of an audience <xref rid="pone.0046597-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. It involves a period of anxious apprehension prior to a speech on a difficult topic in front of a panel of judges. The anxious anticipation phase induces worry and preparation for future threat <xref rid="pone.0046597-deTimary1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. This technique has been used to explore elements of social phobia in clinical <xref rid="pone.0046597-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> and normal populations <xref rid="pone.0046597-Mauss1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. The TSST may be modified for musicians by replacing the speech component with a difficult musical performance task and requiring participants to look over the music and prepare their performance during an anticipation phase, a reliable stress response should be induced.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to explore the efficacy of HRV BF as an intervention for music performance anxiety. We hypothesised that, relative to control, the HRV BF and/or slow breathing intervention would: (1) reduce vagal withdrawal during anxious anticipation of a stressful performance task, leading to increased HRV during the anticipation phase following intervention; and (2) lead to reductions in self-reported state anxiety following musical performance. We demonstrate that a short slow breathing intervention increases HRV, and, amongst highly anxious participants, reduces anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>46 musicians (24 females; aged 19&#x02013;67, <italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30.4, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11.98), trained as wind or brass players (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30), singers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11), or string players (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) (minimum grade 8 as determined by the Australian Music Examinations Board or tertiary level) participated in this study.

Performances were filmed on a Sony HDR-SR7E video recorder mounted on a Giottos VT-806 tripod. Participants were led to believe the recording would be used to assess performance quality. The true purpose of the camera, however, was to present the possibility of negative evaluation and to provide video for examination when anomalies (such as movement artefacts) in HRV recordings were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment was conducted in a sound attenuated room in the School of Psychology&#x02019;s Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of Sydney. Participants were assigned to group by a computer-generated list of random numbers, and after randomisation, fitted with the Polar HR monitor device. Testing was counterbalanced for time of day across group to control for known HRV circadian rhythms <xref rid="pone.0046597-Healy1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Recording began and experimental conditions were marked using time stamps on the Polar watch. All conditions were 5 minutes in accordance with HRV taskforce recommendations <xref rid="pone.0046597-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Screening questionnaires and baseline STAI-S were completed, then a five-minute resting state HRV recording was made while participants were sitting still, palms up, eyes open. <italic>Anticipation phase</italic>: Participants entered the testing room and were instructed to sit still and examine the music for five minutes in order to prepare for their performance. They were informed that their performance would be recorded on video camera while the experimenter observed. Participants were told to prepare for the performance ahead, concentrating on accuracy and musical interpretation, to the best of their ability. The experimenter then left the room. <italic>Performance phase:</italic> Participants were instructed to begin the performance without stopping in the event of a mistake and to remember that interpretive quality was important. Following the testing phase participants moved to the intervention room and completed STAI-S questionnaires. Diaphragmatic breathing was demonstrated and participants completed a number of breathing exercises. <italic>Intervention phase:</italic> Intervention lasted 30 minutes. The biofeedback and breathing control group were given diaphragmatic breating instruction. The biofeedback group received a modified version of a biofeedback procedure previously validated by Lehrer and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Participants were instructed to increase RSA by breathing with the pacer in order to increase the amplitude of HR fluctuations to achieve the best possible feedback graph score while breathing in a free, relaxed way. The breathing control group were given all the same breathing instructions and breathed to a functionally identical pacer without feedback. The no-intervention control group were simply instructed to read their preferred reading material. Post-intervention testing featured exactly the same procedure as the pre-intervention anticipation and performance phases with counterbalanced novel musical stimuli followed by STAI-S completion.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data and Statistics</title><p>Text files of the R-R interval data were extracted from the Polar watch and were entered into Kubios HRV (version 2.0, 2008, biosignal analysis and medical imaging group, University of Kuopio, Finland, MATLAB). Five-minute resting baseline and 5-minute anticipation phases were then filtered with the low automatic filter and visually inspected for artefact. Interbeat intervals (IBI) varying more than 20% from the previous interval <xref rid="pone.0046597-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> were replaced by linear interpolation. Two participants with large amounts of artefact were excluded.

A 3 group (HRV BF, Slow Breathing, No Treatment Control) &#x000d7;(2) time (pre, post intervention), mixed design ANCOVA was also conducted with STAI-S scores as the dependent variable. Baseline STAI-S scores were entered as a covariate in order to control for individual differences in state anxiety. The between-subject factor was whether participants received slow, paced breathing plus biofeedback; slow, paced breathing alone or no-treatment control (book reading). Planned contrasts were conducted on all mixed design ANCOVAs to examine differences between the two intervention groups as well as between the intervention and control. The two within-subjects levels were pre- and post-intervention scores. Statistical significance level was set at 0.05 (one-tailed; pairwise comparisons with directional hypotheses).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>Demographics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046597-t001">Table 1</xref>.

Graphs were visually inspected to determine whether mental illness history had a systematic effect on dependent variables. Individuals with a history of mental illness were evenly spread on all measures except LF/HF ratio on which one participant, with a history of mental illness, scored considerably higher. Since these scores did not fulfil the criteria for outliers outlined above, and the participant appeared normal on the other four measures, they were not excluded from the analysis. Higher levels of both trait anxiety (Kenny, 2004), self-reported mental health history (Marchant-Haycox, 1992) and higher reporting of psychological symptoms (Zander, 2010) have been reported in musicians as compared to normative samples. Consequently, participants with a history of mental illness were not removed from analyses to maintain a representative sample of musicians. Instead, further analyses were conducted to understand the role of mental illness in the findings obtained (described below).</p><fig id="pone-0046597-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0046597.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of participant progress through the study.</title><p>Figure depicts progress through the stages of the experiment, including when and why participants were excluded.

The aim of the study was to examine whether a single session of slow breathing (with or without HRV BF) was effective in reducing both vagal withdrawal and state anxiety in response to the psychosocial stress of musical performance. Participants who received slow breathing exhibited greater increases in HF and decreases in LF/HF ratio than controls after intervention, indicating increased levels of parasympathetic influence on HR while under stress. This increased level of PNS inhibition may allow participants to better regulate physiological arousal prior to music performance and to perform more competently. Amongst highly anxious individuals, the intervention also led to greater reductions in self-reported anxiety than controls, indicating that slow breathing may have clinically-relevant effects for performing musicians who suffer from anxiety.</p><p>The anticipation phase of this experiment mimicked the conditions that can lead to MPA. The presence of the experimenter created the possibility for negative evaluation while the high difficulty of the tasks made it likely that participants would make mistakes, inducing physiological and behavioural symptoms of performance anxiety, indicated by marked HF reductions and self-reported increases in state anxiety respectively. Under these stressful conditions, intervention produced increases in HRV as well as decreases in self-reported anxiety in high anxious individuals.</p><p>Slow breathing, with or without BF, produced differential effects on both HF and LF/HF after intervention compared to controls. Any potential differences produced by the addition of biofeedback were not apparent after a single session. Those who received the slow breathing intervention (relative to controls) showed marked increases in HF, indicating increases in vagal influence on HR during anticipation of a socially stressful and technically challenging musical performance. These increases were observed despite the effects of mental fatigue, which is known to cause decreases in HF <xref rid="pone.0046597-Mizuno1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. This is also a likely explanation for HF decreases in the control group. While the control group showed increases in LF/HF ratio, indicating increased LF relative to HF levels, the intervention group showed decreased levels of LF relative to HF power during the anticipation phase following intervention.</p><p>LF/HF ratio indicates the amount of HRV that is due to a combination of SNS, PNS and blood pressure mechanisms (LF) relative to vagal input (HF) under normal conditions. It should be noted that LF levels are also inflated by slow breathing, especially when breathing at a rate of 0.1 Hz, which is in the LF range. Breathing at this rate creates a resonant effect whereby oscillations of vagal outflow are timed to coincide with those in baroreflex action, producing large increases in the amplitude of HR changes <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Our LF/HF ratio findings under anticipation stress indicate that participants receiving the intervention were not simply continuing to breathe at 0.1 Hz (LF). Rather, the increases in HRV amplitude at the rate of normal breathing (HF) were greater. The HRV amplitude increases associated with the intervention were maintained under normal breathing conditions, and in the face of psychological challenge. Current thinking places LF activity as activity of the baroreflex <xref rid="pone.0046597-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Heathers1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref> and therefore calls into question the direct relationship between LF/HF ratio and SNS/PNS balance (eg. <xref rid="pone.0046597-Pagani1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>); while our findings do not provide evidence on this subject, our findings do indicate that reductions in LF/HF during stress are associated with state-anxiety reductions.</p><p>We also observed a relationship between the level of state anxiety prior to the intervention and state anxiety after the intervention. Regression analyses revealed that initially high anxious individuals tended to show reductions in state anxiety after intervention. By contrast, no effects were observed in those with low state anxiety before the intervention. Regrouping removed this confounding factor and allowed intervention and control participants of similar levels of anxiety to be compared. This finding highlights the potential for slow breathing to reduce state anxiety in musicians who experience anxiety in performance situations.</p><p>These findings support a model of MPA in which autonomic regulation impacts on the experience of anxiety in response to music performance while highlighting the effectiveness of slow breathing as an intervention which can lead to clinically relevant reductions in anxiety. Higher levels of vagal tone are associated with greater executive control and ability to inhibit fear-related emotional responses through cortical inhibition of lower limbic structures <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lane1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>; and enable social engagement through bi-directional feedback between heart and brain <xref rid="pone.0046597-Porges1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Individuals with a high level of vagal tone display greater flexibility in response to challenges and are able to effectively inhibit SNS activity associated with stress <xref rid="pone.0046597-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. This increased autonomic flexibility allows for the effective regulation of negative emotion in the face of stress <xref rid="pone.0046597-Appelhans1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> which is, in turn, required for the amelioration of anxiety. MPA may arise from acute awareness of the possibility for negative evaluation leading to physiological symptoms which subsequently interfere with successful performance <xref rid="pone.0046597-Kenny1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Impacting on physiological feedback mechanisms through slow breathing helps to inhibit threat-related arousal, reduce threat appraisal and break the MPA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046597-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>A variety of questions regarding the role of breathing rate in performance anxiety are raised by this study, for which measurement of breathing rate may help to clarify in future studies. It may be the case that those who reported high anxiety in response to initial performance showed dysregulated breathing as found by Studer et al. <xref rid="pone.0046597-Studer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It may be that hyperventilation in anticipation of performance potentiates physiological anxiety and that either the abdominal breathing training or the slow paced breathing prevented this from occurring after intervention. Breathing rate during anticipation could be compared with HRV and state anxiety findings to determine if better regulated breathing (ie. slower, deeper breathes) leads to both HRV increases and state anxiety decreases. Even if the observed effect of slow breathing is purely due to placebo effect, since it was evident to participants that they were receiving an intervention, the intervention comes with so few costs, that its use may be justified. There are no known side effects, it requires no expensive equipment or special knowledge, it has no financial cost, and it is non-pharmacological. Pharmacological treatments, such as beta-blockers can have adverse mood effects <xref rid="pone.0046597-Head1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Slow breathing also has the added benefits of increased oxygen absorption and lowered blood pressure <xref rid="pone.0046597-Joseph1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Bernardi1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The findings of this preliminary trial warrant further longitudinal investigation in order to better determine the effect of slow breathing on MPA, particularly in samples of those with clinical levels of MPA.</p><p>This study did not include important components of a full HRV BF treatment, such as establishment of resonant frequency and a 10 week course. There may be additional effects which only become apparent with practice. Previous research has shown that longer courses of HRV BF can result in significantly greater HRV increases relative to relaxation techniques <xref rid="pone.0046597-Zucker1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. If there is a therapeutic effect of HRV BF above relaxation produced by slow breathing then this may only become apparent after a full course of treatment. This possibility remains to be tested. An important component omitted in the present study was the establishment of individual resonant frequency. Lehrer et al. <xref rid="pone.0046597-Lehrer2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> argue that resonant frequency calculation is integral to the therapeutic effect of HRV BF since maximal HRV is produced at resonant frequency. Previous studies, which have calculated resonant frequency prior to commencing treatment, have reported results supporting the efficacy of HRV BF <xref rid="pone.0046597-DelPozo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Nolan1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046597-Thurber1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. The establishment of resonant frequency is a time consuming process, which was not practical in the present, single session experiment. It is possible that differences between HRV BF and slow breathing may emerge when resonant frequency is calculated for individual participants.</p><p>In summary, the results of the present study indicate that diaphragmatic breathing instruction and a single session of slow breathing are sufficient to produce HRV increases and state anxiety reductions among musicians with high state anxiety, and that biofeedback is not necessary for these changes to occur. This suggests that integration of slow breathing with more comprehensive psychotherapy strategies may have clinical utility in the treatment of individuals with MPA. Slow breathing may be a viable alternative to beta-blockers for inhibition of SNS activity during performance. Future studies could compare slow breathing to beta-blockers and placebo treatments such as paced breathing at a normal rate (approximately 15 breathes per minute <xref rid="pone.0046597-Joseph1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>). A longitudinal study may help determine whether the addition of biofeedback leads to better results with practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would also like to extend our thanks to Wayne Jencke for generously loaning the biofeedback equipment and software used in this experiment.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0046597-Ostwald1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
