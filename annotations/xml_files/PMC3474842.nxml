Whilst the antiviral drug oseltamivir (a neuraminidase inhibitor) is approved for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza during outbreaks, there have been no trials comparing treatment only (T) versus treatment and prophylaxis (T&#x00026;P) in Aged Care Facilities (ACFs). Our objective was to compare a policy of T versus T&#x00026;P for influenza outbreaks in ACFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We performed a cluster randomised controlled trial in 16 ACFs, that followed a policy of either &#x0201c;T&#x0201d;&#x02014;oseltamivir treatment (75 mg twice a day for 5 days)&#x02014;or &#x0201c;T&#x00026;P&#x0201d;&#x02014;treatment and prophylaxis (75 mg once a day for 10 days) for influenza outbreaks over three years, in addition to enhanced surveillance. The primary outcome measure was the attack rate of influenza. Secondary outcomes measures were deaths, hospitalisation, pneumonia and adverse events. Laboratory testing was performed to identify the viral cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks. The study period 30 June 2006 to 23 December 2008 included three southern hemisphere winters. During that time, influenza was confirmed as the cause of nine of the 23 ILI outbreaks that occurred amongst the 16 ACFs. The policy of T&#x00026;P resulted in a significant reduction in the influenza attack rate amongst residents: 93/255 (36%) in residents in T facilities versus 91/397 (23%) in T&#x00026;P facilities (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002). We observed a non-significant reduction in staff: 46/216 (21%) in T facilities versus 47/350 (13%) in T&#x00026;P facilities (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5). There was a significant reduction in mean duration of outbreaks (T&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24 days, T&#x00026;P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11 days, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). Deaths, hospitalisations and pneumonia were non-significantly reduced in the T&#x00026;P allocated facilities.

In developed countries, the majority of deaths attributable to influenza occur in people aged over 65 years, especially those over 80 years with pre-existing health problems and residents of Aged Care Facilities (ACFs) <xref rid="pone.0046509-Nicholson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Attack rates of 20&#x02013;40% may occur in ACF outbreaks and are associated with increased rates of hospitalisation and death <xref rid="pone.0046509-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046509-Gaillat1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The elderly may also shed influenza virus at higher levels and for longer duration than younger adults <xref rid="pone.0046509-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046509-Mullooly1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046509-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As a result, transmission to others is more likely. In addition, accentuated transmission of influenza within closed institutions is a recognised problem, which results in significant morbidity and costs <xref rid="pone.0046509-Barlow1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046509-Sartor1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046509-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Immunisation against influenza is recommended for high-risk populations in Australia including all persons aged 65 years and over <xref rid="pone.0046509-Australian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Vaccination is less effective in the elderly <xref rid="pone.0046509-Jefferson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and influenza outbreaks have been documented in highly vaccinated ACF populations, where the intensity of transmission appears to override vaccine-conferred immunity <xref rid="pone.0046509-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus, additional strategies such as the use of antiviral therapy need to be considered.</p><p>Although oseltamivir is effective for treating and preventing influenza <xref rid="pone.0046509-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046509-Treanor1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, strategies of oseltamivir use in outbreaks, namely treatment alone, or treatment together with prophylaxis, have never been compared head to head. As frail institutionalised elderly are disproportionately affected by influenza outbreaks (yet rarely included in randomised controlled trials <xref rid="pone.0046509-Ridda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>), we decided to evaluate the effectiveness of these two different strategies in a cluster-randomised controlled clinical trial. We chose to randomly assign the strategies by facility, rather than by individual, because influenza is a communicable disease that once introduced into a facility can be readily transmitted, and because the use of oseltamivir to treat patients in an outbreak may result in &#x0201c;herd protective effects&#x0201d; beyond an individual effect.</p><p>Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a policy of treatment and prophylaxis with oseltamivir would be a more effective than treatment only. Our results provide some support for this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of The University of Sydney and The Children's Hospital at Westmead.

Treatment and prophylaxis was associated with a reduced attack rate, and a non-significant reduction in secondary outcomes. Our results support recent guideline statements advocating such a policy <xref rid="pone.0046509-Communicable1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Previously, Schilling et al demonstrated in a pilot study that zanamivir appeared promising when used in a large ACF in the United States, but to our knowledge further trials have not been attempted with this or other neuraminidase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0046509-Schilling1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Strengths of our study include the prospective cluster-randomised controlled trial design run over three influenza seasons. Our active surveillance and detailed epidemiological investigation of potential outbreaks led to far more influenza outbreaks being detected than usually reported in New South Wales. Our sample size assumptions proved rather optimistic given we stated that we expected to see attack rates of 10% (or 15%) attack rate in the T arm and 3% (or 6%) in the T&#x00026;P arm. The higher than expected rates in both arms could have arisen for many different reasons: our detailed investigations might have revealed the true attack rates in ACF outbreaks; the style of nursing may have contributed as all our facilities were under the same management company; or perhaps our enhanced education and infection control sessions with facility staff were not as successful as we hoped. An important unanticipated result from our study was that influenza was only responsible for a minority of ILI outbreaks with 14 out of 23 respiratory illness outbreaks being due to other viruses (or no aetiological agent identified). More expansive nucleic acid testing may have identified the other viral causes of outbreaks; only direct immunofluorescence was used to detect a limited range of respiratory viruses as the interventions were directed to confirmed influenza outbreaks. Our results suggest that &#x0201c;Point of care testing&#x0201d; and laboratory confirmation of influenza or other respiratory virus infections is important in the investigation of ILI outbreaks in ACFs, and it is unwise to assume that all ILI outbreaks in ACFs are due to influenza.</p><p>The non-significant reduction in our secondary pre-specified outcome measures (deaths, hospitalisations and chest infections in residents) provide additional reassurance that the policy of treatment and prophylaxis is appropriate. These results was achieved despite our inability to treat all &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; residents and staff due to the constraints of the trial design (some declined consent) and the practicalities of treatment (some residents and staff were not eligible for treatment). The research design, including the requirement for individual informed consent possibly limited the proportion of residents and staff who accepted the interventions, and it is possible that greater coverage with oseltamivir prophylaxis would achieve greater protection.</p><p>The weaknesses of our trial were the low number of influenza outbreaks (nine) and the play of chance on randomisation, with influenza outbreaks occurring in three T ACFs and six T&#x00026;P ACFs. Recruitment of more nursing homes, and thus clusters, would have helped balance randomization but this was not feasible given our funding and partnership with the ACF provider. The limited number of outbreaks reduced the power of the trial, especially for the secondary outcomes, which whilst generally in favour of the T&#x00026;P policy, did not reach statistical significance. We recognise that our trial was underpowered as our main results were not confirmed in some of our sensitivity analyses, given the limited number of randomised facilities with outbreaks during the study. The imbalance of outbreaks amongst the two cluster randomised groups did not lead to statistically significant differences between the baseline variables of the outbreak characteristics or residents but the delay in declaring the outbreak in the T only facilities, and corresponding increase in the number of residents who were sick at the time of the implementation of the trial intervention could have contributed to the positive result of the trial. The imbalance in the number of residents and staff consented was due to the requirement of written informed consent for all residents who would be offered treatment. In T facility outbreaks, residents without symptoms did not need to be treated (or tested) and were therefore not approached for consent during an outbreak. In T&#x00026;P facilities, we were required to obtain consent in all eligible residents in order to deliver the prophylactic arm of the trial. Despite attempts to consent all residents prior to outbreaks, the turnover of residents and huge workload required, meant that we were only able to consent a minority prior to an outbreak. Given that this differential consent rate could have potentially identified more people with subclinical influenza in the T&#x00026;P facilities, we may have underestimated the effectiveness of a policy of T&#x00026;P.</p><p>Our experience emphasizes the need for careful planning and investment to rapidly establish a treatment and prophylaxis intervention during outbreaks. In the trial, numerous extra research staff (up to ten) were enlisted during outbreaks yet it was often 2&#x02013;3 days before it was possible to complete prophylaxis of all at-risk consented residents and staff. Some of the most time consuming duties may be lessened in routine clinical practice, such as a written consent process. However, other tasks would remain difficult to achieve quickly, such as assessing the renal function of every resident, and establishing whether they, or their legal guardians wished treatment to be given, unless this had been determined beforehand as recommended <xref rid="pone.0046509-Communicable1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The lack of blinding in our study could have created bias in case ascertainment, but a double-blind study would probably be unfeasible, or at least prohibitively expensive.</p><p>Our mathematical modeling of transmission also showed a substantial reduction in the reproduction number in the T&#x00026;P facilities, relative to the T facilities. This reduction is due to decreased susceptibility of prophylaxed patients, and decreased infectivity of breakthrough and undetected cases. The basic reproduction number for influenza is assumed to be 2 (or less) in the general population although it may be much higher in modified communities such as ACFs. After allowing for some prior immunity and vaccination, it seems plausible that a reduction in transmission of 70% would be required to explain the containment of the epidemics in the T&#x00026;P group.</p><p>We acknowledge the difficulty of conducting trials in ACFs, and, in retrospect, the resources required to undertake the trial were underestimated. As a result of our unexpected difficulties in establishing the intervention, some of the planned data collection was not possible. Given the low power of our study, we believe that further research to confirm these results would be important.</p><p>What are the implications of this study for routine public health policy? We believe that public health departments should explore the feasibility and benefits of introducing an active surveillance approach for ILI in ACFs during at risk periods such as winter. This could be done by telephone or electronic communication, and centralised for a large number of nursing facilities. The potential advantage of early diagnosis and treatment may not only prevent unpleasant symptoms and illness for residents but also for their carers, including staff and relatives. Laboratory confirmation of outbreaks will also allow a clearer understanding of the clinical features and outcomes of non-influenza virus outbreaks in the frail elderly. Our observation of multiple viral outbreaks occurring simultaneously within an ACF and the concurrent illness of staff suggest that ACFs provide an important focus of viral infection in winter months and a possible mechanism of maintaining infection in the community. Even if the potential benefits to residents of reducing the burden of illness is discounted, control of infection in ACFs may be an important public health intervention for the wider community. Although deaths amongst younger people such as the staff of ACFs are rare, they have been reported <xref rid="pone.0046509-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. We would argue that infection control, including antiviral treatment, is important.</p><p>Our results need to be considered in the light of reports of oseltamivir resistance, and increased resistance will clearly attenuate the effectiveness of a T&#x00026;P policy <xref rid="pone.0046509-Moscona1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. As the more widespread use of prophylaxis could increase resistance, surveillance for influenza A subtypes and oseltamivir resistance in local geographic areas is important <xref rid="pone.0046509-Hurt1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. On the other hand, our results provide indirect support that the use of other antiviral medication for treatment AND prophylaxis might be an effective policy for ACFs.</p><p>An important point is that data on drug efficacy and safety is rarely available for the frail vulnerable patient: this trial is a step forward in providing some evidence for those in ACFs. With our ageing populations, many millions of people are cared for in such institutions and it is important to establish the risks and benefits of interventions for this population who are usually excluded in medical research. We appreciate the difficulties in conducting trials for such populations but we hope that others will also consider studies involving the frail older resident of ACFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0046509.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
