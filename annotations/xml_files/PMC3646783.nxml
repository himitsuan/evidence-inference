This is thought to contribute to airway remodeling and airflow obstruction. We have previously observed that long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids can not only reduce bronchial inflammation, but can also attenuate lung function decline in moderate-severe COPD. We hypothesized that inhaled corticosteroids and current smoking modulate bronchial extracellular matrix components in COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To compare major extracellular matrix components (elastic fibers; proteoglycans [versican, decorin]; collagens type I and III) in bronchial biopsies 1) after 30-months inhaled steroids treatment or placebo; and 2) between current and ex-smokers with COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We included 64 moderate-severe, steroid-naive COPD patients (24/40 (ex)-smokers, 62&#x000b1;7 years, 46 (31&#x02013;54) packyears, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 62&#x000b1;9% predicted) at baseline in this randomized, controlled trial. 19 and 13 patients received 30-months treatment with fluticasone or placebo, respectively. Bronchial biopsies collected at baseline and after 30 months were studied using (immuno)histochemistry to evaluate extracellular matrix content. Percentage and density of stained area were calculated by digital image analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>30-Months inhaled steroids increased the percentage stained area of versican (9.6% [CI 0.9 to 18.3%]; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03) and collagen III (20.6% [CI 3.8 to 37.4%]; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) compared to placebo. Increased collagen I staining density correlated with increased post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> after inhaled steroids treatment (Rs&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.45, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). There were no differences between smokers and ex-smokers with COPD in percentages and densities for all extracellular matrix proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data show that long-term inhaled corticosteroids treatment partially changes the composition of extracellular matrix in moderate-severe COPD. This is associated with increased lung function, suggesting that long-term inhaled steroids modulate airway remodeling thereby potentially preventing airway collapse in COPD. Smoking status is not associated with bronchial extracellular matrix proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/ct6ebl2">NCT00158847</ext-link>

This pulmonary remodeling has been linked to airflow limitation in COPD <xref rid="pone.0063430-Hogg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Gosselink1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM), produced by (myo)fibroblasts, epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells, contribute to this remodeling process and alter airway mechanics and dynamics <xref rid="pone.0063430-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Suki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The ECM consists of three major components: elastic fibers, proteoglycans and collagens, which are involved in cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, water balance and regulation of inflammatory mediators <xref rid="pone.0063430-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The composition of the pulmonary ECM is different in subjects with and without COPD. Fewer elastic fibers are found in small airways and alveoli of COPD patients than in healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0063430-Black1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Chrzanowski1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, versican, a large proteoglycan is more abundant, while the small proteoglycan decorin is reduced in small airways in COPD compared to healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0063430-Merrilees1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063430-vanStraaten1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Collagens are the main component of the ECM, and collagen composition differs between COPD patients and healthy controls as shown by the observation that collagen type I is lower in the large and small airways <xref rid="pone.0063430-Annoni1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and collagen type III expression is lower in the small airways of COPD patients than in healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0063430-Gosselink1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Since smoking is a risk factor for COPD, this may also influence ECM composition. Indeed, cigarette smoke has been shown to induce secretion of several profibrotic growth factors, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;), both in human lung fibroblasts and in lung tissue of COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0063430-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Takizawa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Rodent models exposed to cigarette smoke had less lung elastic fibers, but more collagens than sham-smoked animals <xref rid="pone.0063430-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Others even reported an increased elastic fibers gene expression in lung tissue of severe COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0063430-Deslee1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Smoke exposure decreased proteoglycan expression as demonstrated by a study with pulmonary fibroblasts from moderate and very severe COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0063430-Zandvoort1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Although generally (neutrophil dominated) inflammation in COPD is considered to be resistant to steroids treatment, we recently observed that long-term inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) treatment partially decreased bronchial inflammation (CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and mast cells) -without effects on neutrophils- and attenuated lung function decline in moderate-severe COPD patients participating in the GLUCOLD (Groningen Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease) study <xref rid="pone.0063430-Lapperre1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. ICS may affect ECM through various mechanisms, including modulation of inflammation by profibrotic mediators and targeting ECM genes directly. This may explain differences in the effects of steroids that are observed in <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Whereas steroid treatment of asthmatics did not change elastic fibers and collagens in bronchial biopsies <xref rid="pone.0063430-Godfrey1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, steroids did inhibit serum-induced proteoglycan production in fetal lung fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0063430-Todorova1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In contrast to asthma, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, effects of ICS on ECM composition in COPD patients have not been described.</p><p>We hypothesized that inhaled steroids treatment modulates bronchial ECM components in COPD. In addition, we hypothesized that current smoking affects bronchial ECM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects and Study Design</title><p>The current study is a substudy of the GLUCOLD (Groningen Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease) study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial in which 114 moderate-severe COPD steroid-naive patients were included <xref rid="pone.0063430-Lapperre1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

In addition, we show that the content of ECM proteins in bronchial biopsies did not significantly differ between smokers and ex-smokers with moderate-severe COPD.</p><p>This study shows that the content of elastic fibers, major proteoglycans and collagens in the bronchial mucosa are similar in current and ex-smokers with COPD.

We observed no significant difference in versican and decorin content between current and ex-smokers with COPD, which is in line with an <italic>in vitro</italic> study with cultured lung fibroblasts of moderate COPD patients and control subjects. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure of these cells did not affect versican gene expression, but decreased decorin gene expression <xref rid="pone.0063430-Zandvoort1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This apparent difference with our findings could be explained by the fact that smoke-exposed fibroblasts are only selectively triggered compared to a multifactorial environment <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, in our study collagen type I and III were not significantly different between current and ex-smokers with COPD, which is similar to recent observations in cultured fibroblasts of COPD and non-COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0063430-Krimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>The percentage of versican and collagen III increased with long-term ICS treatment compared to placebo, without significant changes in elastic fibers, decorin and collagen I. In line with this, ICS for four weeks or 3.5 years did not affect elastic fibers content in bronchial biopsies of asthmatics compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0063430-Godfrey1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Notably, we found a significant increase in collagen III, but not collagen I, after 2.5 years of ICS treatment compared to placebo, which was associated with lung function. Previous studies in COPD patients showed that gene expression of collagen 1&#x003b1;1 and collagen 3&#x003b1;1 in small airways and parenchyma was decreased in association with lower FEV<sub>1</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0063430-Gosselink1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Ning1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, collagen may have stabilizing effects on the collapsible airways in patients with COPD, which could be further enhanced by long-term use of ICS.</p><p>Our study has various strong points. We included only steroid-naive COPD patients, excluding possible influences of steroids on ECM components at baseline. Both the percentage and density of the stained area in bronchial biopsies were analyzed: the percentage corresponds to the presence of the ECM protein, whereas density represents the local amount of ECM protein. For the analysis of the percentage, we used the total selected tissue area for analysis as an internal reference parameter according to the recommendations of the Joint ATS/ERS Task Force <xref rid="pone.0063430-Hsia1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We considered the possibility that part of our changes is explained by an effect of ICS on edema. However, less edema resulting from ICS treatment would probably have increased percentage and density all studied ECM proteins, whereas in our study the percentage of only some ECM proteins was affected. Furthermore, we previously found lower numbers of selected bronchial inflammatory cells after ICS treatment in the current study <xref rid="pone.0063430-Lapperre1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We did not find correlations between the effect of ICS treatment on inflammatory cells and ECM components (data not shown).</p><p>There are some considerations when interpreting our results. Matched bronchial biopsies both at baseline and follow-up were available from approximately half of our COPD patients, because part of the tissue was no longer available. This could have negatively affected the power of our study. Still, the number of available biopsies was similar among both groups. Furthermore, since one biopsy per patient per visit was studied, we cannot exclude that local heterogeneity of ECM proteins has affected our results. To minimize selection bias, we only selected biopsies with the largest lamina propria. Lung tissue specimens from healthy or never-smokers were not available, but comparisons with these groups were beyond the objectives of this study. Furthermore, features of remodeling in COPD are different between large and small airways, nevertheless we evaluated the ECM in the central airways only <xref rid="pone.0063430-Hogg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and important correlations with lung function could still be observed. Finally, despite treatment randomization, we accidentally found that the percentage and densities of versican, decorin and collagen III at baseline were significantly higher in the placebo than the fluticasone group. Not withstanding this, when still adjusted for the baseline values, we observed effect of ICS therapy. Taken together, we do not believe that the above limitations largely affected our results.</p><p>How can we explain that smoking has no effect on ECM? Exposure of cultured pulmonary fibroblasts of moderate and very severe COPD patients to CSE resulted in downregulation of decorin, but not versican and collagen type I and III expression <xref rid="pone.0063430-Zandvoort1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Krimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In addition, collagen I and tropoelastin were dose-dependently inhibited by CSE in rat fetal lung fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0063430-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Mice with long-term exposure to cigarette smoke showed a decrease in elastic fibers and collagen type III, without significant effect on collagen I <xref rid="pone.0063430-Churg1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We could only partially confirm these <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies. Inflammation and remodeling in the lung <italic>in vivo</italic> are simultaneous and complex ongoing processes and may not be mimicked by studies in isolated fibroblasts and inbred animals kept under specific conditions. Furthermore, after smoking cessation bronchial inflammation (at least) partially persists <xref rid="pone.0063430-Lapperre2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which is in line with our finding of similar ECM composition between smokers and ex-smokers.</p><p>We showed a positive correlation between the content of collagen and lung function after treatment with inhaled steroids. However, the current opinion of remodeling is that airway wall thickening is strongly associated with progression of COPD <xref rid="pone.0063430-Hogg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, suggesting that increased ECM deposition is related to a decreased lung function. How can we explain this apparent contradiction? In COPD, an imbalance between proteases and anti-proteases is present, as shown by an excess of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and a relative shortage of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) <xref rid="pone.0063430-Brusselle1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. MMP degrade both collagens and proteoglycans <xref rid="pone.0063430-Hogg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Brusselle1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063430-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Dexamethasone can reduce MMP-9 and increase TIMP-1 release from alveolar macrophages of COPD patients <xref rid="pone.0063430-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which may result in a decreased capacity to degrade ECM. This is in line with our observation that ICS increase collagen and versican. Also the observation from Annoni <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063430-Annoni1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, showing that patients with COPD have lower collagen I densities in their airways, is in line with the speculation that an increase in collagen I induced by ICS could stabilize the airways. Furthermore, the observed positive correlation between collagen with lung function and PC<sub>20</sub> before and after long-term ICS therapy also suggests that increased airway wall fibrosis is actually preventing both airway collapse and attenuating airway smooth muscle contractions in COPD. Besides airway remodeling, emphysema might also influence airway collapse, which could contribute to the airflow obstruction. Unfortunately, no data were collected to quantify the extent of emphysema in our cohort of COPD patients.</p><p>Although smoking cessation shows positive clinical effects <xref rid="pone.0063430-Rabe1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, smoking status was not significantly correlated with our studied ECM components. Treatment with ICS increased the percentage versican and collagen III. We found positive correlations between ECM proteins and several lung function parameters at baseline and after treatment with ICS. Therefore, our data may implicate that steroids alter airway structure by increasing ECM content in COPD which is associated with preserved lung function. This suggests that increased presence ECM proteins do not by themselves lead to detrimental consequences, but instead can prevent airway collapse.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that treatment for 30 months with inhaled corticosteroids increased the relative content of versican and collagen III in the large airways of patients with moderate to severe COPD. Our data suggest that steroids not only prevent bronchial inflammation but possibly also alter airway structure by increasing specific ECM proteins in COPD that are associated with improvements in lung function. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in other studies, and to understand the possible implications of these findings for current treatment strategies and for the development of future, targeted anti-remodeling medication in COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0063430.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
