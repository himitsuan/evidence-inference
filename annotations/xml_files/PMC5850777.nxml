Patients were followed for a single ART cycle. A total of 939 women were randomized (1:1) to receive either r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH. Randomization, stratified by study site and participant age, was conducted<italic> via</italic> an interactive voice response system.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s5" sec-type="methods"><title>PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS</title><p>Women classified as having POR, based on criteria incorporating the ESHRE Bologna criteria, were down-regulated with a long GnRH agonist protocol and following successful down-regulation were randomized (1:1) to COS with r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of oocytes retrieved following COS. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events, including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses investigated safety outcomes and correlations between live birth and baseline characteristics (age and number of oocytes retrieved in previous ART treatment cycles or serum anti-M&#x000fc;llerian hormone (AMH)). The significance of the treatment effect was tested by generalized linear models (Poisson regression for counts and logistic regression for binary endpoints) adjusting for age and country.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s6" sec-type="results"><title>MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE</title><p>Of 949 subjects achieving down-regulation, 939 were randomized to r-hFSH/r-hLH (<italic>n</italic> = 477) or r-hFSH (<italic>n</italic> = 462) and received treatment.</p><p>Efficacy assessment: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the mean (SD) number of oocytes retrieved (primary endpoint) was 3.3 (2.71) in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group compared with 3.6 (2.82) in the r-hFSH group (between-group difference not statistically significant). The observed difference between treatment groups (r-hFSH/r-hLH and r-hFSH, respectively) for efficacy outcomes decreased over the course of pregnancy (biochemical pregnancy rate: 17.3% versus 23.9%; clinical pregnancy rate: 14.1% versus 16.8%; ongoing pregnancy rate: 11.0% versus 12.4%; and live birth rate: 10.6% versus 11.7%). An interaction (identified <italic>post hoc</italic>) between baseline characteristics related to POR and treatment effect was noted for live birth, with r-hFSH/r-hLH associated with a higher live birth rate for patients with moderate or severe POR, whereas r-hFSH was associated with a higher live birth rate for those with mild POR. A <italic>post hoc</italic> logistic regression analysis indicated that the incidence of total pregnancy outcome failure was lower in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group (6.7%) compared with the r-hFSH group (12.4%) with an odds ratio of 0.52 (95% CI 0.33, 0.82; <italic>P</italic> = 0.005).</p><p>Safety assessment: The overall proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring during or after r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH use (stimulation or post-stimulation phase) was 19.9% and 26.8%, respectively. There was no consistent pattern of TEAEs associated with either treatment.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s7"><title>LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION</title><p>Despite using inclusion criteria for POR incorporating the ESHRE Bologna criteria, further investigation is needed to determine the impact of the heterogeneity of POR in the Bologna patient population. The observed correlation between baseline clinical characteristics related to POR and live birth rate, as well as the observed differences between groups regarding total pregnancy outcome failure were from <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses, and the study was not powered for these endpoints. In addition, the attrition rate for pregnancy outcomes in this trial may not reflect general medical practice. Furthermore, as the patient population was predominantly White these results might not be applicable to other ethnicities.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s8"><title>WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS</title><p>In the population of women with POR investigated in this study, although the number of oocytes retrieved was similar following stimulation with either a fixed-ratio combination of r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH monotherapy, <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses showed that there was a lower rate of total pregnancy outcome failure in patients receiving r-hFSH/r-hLH, in addition to a higher live birth rate in patients with moderate and severe POR. These findings are clinically relevant and require additional investigation. The benefit:risk balance of treatment with either r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH remains positive.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s9"><title>STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)</title><p>This study was funded by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.

Between 5.6% and 35.1% of women will exhibit poor ovarian response (POR) (<xref rid="dew360C25" ref-type="bibr">Oudendijk <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). POR does not have a single cause and the population with POR is, therefore, heterogeneous and difficult to concisely characterize, with clinical trials conducted to date using diverse defining criteria (<xref rid="dew360C9" ref-type="bibr">Ferraretti <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C29" ref-type="bibr">Polyzos and Devroey, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C31" ref-type="bibr">Polyzos and Sunkara, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C27" ref-type="bibr">Papathanasiou <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). The most consistent variable affecting ovarian response is age and POR is associated with chronological ageing (<xref rid="dew360C9" ref-type="bibr">Ferraretti <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), with subfertility becoming more pronounced after the age of 35 years (<xref rid="dew360C34" ref-type="bibr">The ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2010</xref>). In addition, an age-related decline in response to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation and a reduction in the number of oocytes, oocyte quality, fertilization rate, number of embryos, implantation rate and, ultimately, live birth rate have been well documented (<xref rid="dew360C24" ref-type="bibr">Nelson <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Owing to social changes, more women delay childbearing and this has resulted in a greater number of women in their late thirties and early forties seeking infertility treatment, highlighting the need for studies in patients with POR (<xref rid="dew360C34" ref-type="bibr">The ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C15" ref-type="bibr">Kocourkova <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A systematic review identified 47 randomized controlled trials that used 41 different descriptions for POR, with each definition used by no more than three trials (<xref rid="dew360C29" ref-type="bibr">Polyzos and Devroey, 2011</xref>). This disparity in the definitions used makes it challenging to compare between, and draw conclusions from, clinical trials investigating women with POR and has meant that, in general, the results of studies and meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution when considering their applicability to clinical practice. To address this lack of consistency, the ESHRE Bologna criteria were developed by consensus in 2011 as an attempt to standardize the definition of POR for use in clinical trials, and to better enable their comparison (<xref rid="dew360C9" ref-type="bibr">Ferraretti <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, following the development of these criteria, no adequately powered, prospective, randomized controlled trials have investigated treatment in this population, and an ideal protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in women with POR has yet to be identified. There is, however, some evidence that supplementing recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) with recombinant human LH (r-hLH) during ART may have beneficial effects on outcomes in women with POR (<xref rid="dew360C6" ref-type="bibr">Bosch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C10" ref-type="bibr">Hill <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Supplementation with LH may be beneficial owing to increased FSH receptor expression and growth, in addition to improved follicular recruitment and a reduced rate of granulosa cell apoptosis (<xref rid="dew360C12" ref-type="bibr">Hillier, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C32" ref-type="bibr">Ruvolo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A meta-analysis by <xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref>, which included 6443 patients from 40 randomized controlled trials (45 quantitative studies in total), found that there was no difference in the number of oocytes retrieved from women in the overall analysis population who were treated with r-hFSH/r-hLH compared with those treated with r-hFSH alone. However, when women with POR (<italic>n</italic> = 1077) were considered separately, significantly more oocytes were retrieved with r-hFSH/r-hLH compared with r-hFSH (weighted mean difference +0.75 oocytes; 95% CI 0.14, 1.36) (<xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). In addition, significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates were observed with r-hFSH/r-hLH compared with r-hFSH in both the overall population (risk ratio [RR] 1.09; 95% CI 1.01, 1.18) and the subpopulation of women with POR (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.01, 1.67), with a greater observed difference between treatments observed in the POR group (<xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). However, the definitions of POR were heterogeneous among these studies because the criteria were defined by the authors of each study included in the meta-analysis, as all studies preceded the publication of the Bologna criteria. Nonetheless, these study data represented the best available at the time.</p><p>The Efficacy and Safety of Pergoveris in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ESPART) trial was designed to investigate the hypothesis that a fixed-ratio (2:1) combination of r-hFSH/r-hLH was generally safe and superior to r-hFSH alone, in terms of the number of oocytes retrieved, for COS in patients with POR. The POR inclusion criteria used in this trial incorporated the Bologna criteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="dew360TB2">I</xref>). Fixed-ratio (2:1) combination follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa (r-hFSH 150 IU plus r-hLH 75 IU; Pergoveris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is indicated for stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency, defined by an endogenous serum LH level &#x0003c;1.2 IU/l. Additionally in some countries, it is indicated for COS in sub-optimal responders, defined as having a previous response to COS characterized by either a small number (&#x0003c;7) of pre-ovulatory follicles or the use of high FSH doses (&#x02265;3000 IU per cycle) or advanced (&#x02265;35 years) maternal age. Follitropin alfa (GONAL-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Merck KGaA) is indicated for anovulation in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate and for stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for ART and in association with an LH preparation for stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.

A detailed description of the methodology has been published previously (<xref rid="dew360C14" ref-type="bibr">Humaidan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) and is summarized below. The study was performed in accordance with the clinical trial protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization&#x02013;Good Clinical Practice guidelines and all applicable regulatory requirements. All participants provided written informed consent prior to entry.</p><sec id="dew360s14a"><title>Study participants</title><p>Women were included in ESPART if they were &#x02265;18&#x02013;&#x0003c;41 years old, had a BMI between 18 and 31 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (inclusive), were eligible for COS and ART treatment (including ICSI) and had a diagnosis of POR based upon criteria incorporating the 2011 ESHRE Bologna criteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="dew360TB2">I</xref>) (<xref rid="dew360C9" ref-type="bibr">Ferraretti <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). At least two of the POR inclusion criteria had to be met for inclusion in ESPART. The ESHRE Bologna criteria were not utilized as published, rather a stricter interpretation was applied to remove diagnostic subjectivity, reduce patient heterogeneity and exclude patients with the worst reproductive prognosis. In order to achieve this, the trial excluded women with other &#x02018;risk factors for POR&#x02019;, women aged &#x02265;41 years, and women with at least two previous episodes of POR after maximal stimulation. Furthermore, the upper threshold of serum AMH was increased to 1.3 ng/ml based on evidence that this cutoff level is superior to 1.1 ng/ml for POR prediction (<xref rid="dew360C8" ref-type="bibr">Ferraretti and Gianaroli, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C17" ref-type="bibr">La Marca and Sunkara, 2014</xref>). Additional key exclusion criteria included primary ovarian failure and the use of preimplantation genetic screening or diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s14b"><title>Study treatments and interventions</title><p>The trial duration for each patient was a maximum of 365 days, and the trial was conducted between January 2014 and February 2015. Following pituitary down-regulation with daily triptorelin acetate (Decapeptyl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Saint-Prex, Switzerland) and a negative pregnancy test, women were randomized 1:1 to undergo COS with either a fixed-ratio combination of r-hFSH 300 IU plus r-hLH 150 IU (follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa; Pergoveris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or r-hFSH 300 IU monotherapy (follitropin alfa; GONAL-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), with the dose fixed for the first 4 days of COS. Women were randomized <italic>via</italic> an interactive voice response system (Cenduit GmbH, Switzerland), and randomization was stratified by study site and participant age (&#x0003c;35 or &#x02265;35 years).</p><p>The investigator and all site personnel (with the exception of the trial nurse/coordinator and/or pharmacist/pharmacy assistant who informed participants of their treatment) were blinded to treatment allocation throughout the duration of the trial. A special agreement for respecting the blinding procedure was signed by all personnel involved in the trial, and each site documented the procedures used to maintain the blind. In the case of dosage adjustment, the blind was kept intact with generic instructions given to the trial nurse or pharmacist by the investigator, for both trial drugs. The biostatistics team remained blinded to the treatment codes until the database was locked, the Statistical Analysis Plan finalized and the analysis sets agreed. This single-blind design was implemented as the quality and scientific value of the data obtained from an assessor-blind design ensures the highest level of integrity while reducing patients&#x02019; treatment burdens resulting from the implementation of a double blind, double-dummy design.</p><p>A long GnRH agonist protocol was used to ensure that the contribution of endogenous LH was minimized, to allow for a fair assessment of the exogenous LH being administered in the group receiving r-hFSH/r-hLH. Triptorelin acetate 0.1 mg was administered daily from cycle day 20&#x02013;21 after confirmed ovulation in subjects with spontaneous menses or from cycle day 3&#x02013;4 in anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory subjects with induced menses. Pituitary down-regulation, confirmed by a serum oestradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) level &#x02264;50 pg/ml, was assessed after 14 days of triptorelin acetate treatment. If down-regulation was not confirmed, treatment with triptorelin acetate continued for an additional 7 days. If E<sub>2</sub> was &#x0003e; 50 pg/ml at Day 21, the subject was excluded from further treatment in the trial. Triptorelin acetate administration was continued in subjects with confirmation of down-regulation until the administration of recombinant hCG (r-hCG; Ovidrel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Ovitrelle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Prefilled Syringe, Merck KGaA) to trigger final follicular maturation.</p><p>Within 4 days after confirmation of down-regulation, either r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH was administered concurrently with daily triptorelin acetate. Dose adjustments of r-hFSH (either increases or decreases in 75 IU increments, with concomitant automatic adjustment of r-hLH in participants treated with r-hFSH/r-hLH owing to the combined formulation) were allowed after the first 4 days of stimulation, as monitored by study investigators. The maximum allowed daily dose was 450 IU r-hFSH (plus 225 IU r-hLH in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group).</p><p>Once follicle(s) reached a mean diameter of 17&#x02013;18 mm, a single injection of r-hCG 250 &#x003bc;g was administered to trigger final follicular maturation. Oocyte retrieval was performed 34&#x02013;38 h after r-hCG administration, and embryo transfer took place according to each centre's standard practice (maximum three embryos), 2&#x02013;3 days after oocyte retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="dew360s14c"><title>Study objectives and efficacy endpoints</title><p>The primary objective of the ESPART study was to demonstrate superiority of a fixed-ratio combination of r-hFSH/r-hLH compared with r-hFSH in women with POR undergoing COS for IVF/ICSI. The primary efficacy endpoint was the total number of oocytes retrieved per participant. Secondary endpoints included biochemical pregnancy defined as a positive serum hCG determination 15&#x02013;20 days after r-hCG injection; clinical pregnancy defined as the presence of at least one ultrasound-confirmed gestational sac in the uterus with or without foetal heart activity 35&#x02013;42 days after r-hCG injection; ongoing pregnancy rate defined as the presence of at least one viable foetus with positive heart activity 10 weeks after embryo transfer; live birth rate; and implantation rate defined as the number of gestational sacs divided by the number of embryos transferred per treatment arm. Additional endpoints included cycle cancellation rate; total dose of r-hFSH administered; and number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes in ICSI patients. The endpoint of &#x02018;total pregnancy outcome failure&#x02019; was defined <italic>post hoc</italic> as a combination of preclinical miscarriage (biochemical pregnancy loss), early spontaneous miscarriage (any spontaneous abortion occurring between clinical and ongoing pregnancy), late spontaneous miscarriage (any spontaneous abortion that occurred after ongoing pregnancy) and ectopic pregnancy.</p><p>After analysis of primary and secondary endpoints, a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was conducted to explore the potential impact of heterogeneity due to variability in baseline clinical characteristics on live birth rates. Live birth rate was selected as it is considered the most important outcome for infertility treatment. This analysis used a baseline severity score (BSC) which was based upon the trial's POR inclusion criteria conditions. The criteria used to define BSC were (i) age &#x02265;40 and (ii) reduced ovarian reserve using stricter cut-offs than those used in the trial, either &#x0003c;2 oocytes retrieved during the most recent previous ART cycle or, if no previous cycle data were available, baseline serum AMH &#x0003c;0.5 ng/ml (measured at screening). The BSC for a subject could take the value 0 (mild) if none of these criteria were met; 1 (moderate) if one criterion was met; or 2 (severe) if two criteria were met.</p><sec id="dew360s14c_1"><title>Safety endpoints</title><p>Safety endpoints in this study were defined as incidence and severity of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, assessed in the electronic case report form system during the trial, and local tolerability based on expected injection-site reactions (as included in the label), including injection-site pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling, and/or irritation (<xref rid="dew360C14" ref-type="bibr">Humaidan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C22" ref-type="bibr">Merck, 2015a</xref>,<xref rid="dew360C23" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as adverse events first occurring after the start of down-regulation. OHSS was defined as either early (occurring within 9 days after oocyte retrieval) or late (occurring after Day 10 following oocyte retrieval). Any OHSS leading to hospitalization or medical intervention was defined as a serious adverse event (<xref rid="dew360C35" ref-type="bibr">Zegers-Hochschild <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).

<italic>Post hoc</italic> statistical analyses</title><p>An exploratory analysis was undertaken to investigate the discrepancies between the ESPART study results and those from a recent meta-analysis (<xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The hypothesized discrepancy between the two studies could be attributed to differences in the clinical profile of patients at baseline (<xref rid="dew360C1" ref-type="bibr">Alviggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In the meta-analysis (<xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), definitions of POR were author-defined and therefore, heterogeneous; all studies preceded the publication of the Bologna criteria. In the ESPART study, inclusion criteria were inspired by and incorporated the ESHRE Bologna criteria, however, these criteria may include patient subgroups with different prognoses. Furthermore, the ESPART pregnancy outcomes suggested a possible benefit of r-hLH supplementation after the establishment of pregnancy (positive hCG). Therefore, the analysis investigated whether r-hLH supplementation may provide a heterogeneous benefit depending on the baseline clinical characteristics, and if r-hLH supplementation may specifically reduce the incidence of pregnancy failure.</p><p>The analysis investigating the potential impact of heterogeneity due to variability in baseline clinical characteristics on live birth rates was conducted in the ITT population. A logistic regression model was used to test the main effect of BSC, the main treatment effect, and the interaction effect between BSC and treatment. All other logistic regression models included terms for treatment group, country and age category (&#x0003c;35 versus &#x02265;35 years). The total pregnancy outcome failure rate was analysed using logistic regression in the ITT population, the ET set and the biochemical pregnancy set.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="dew360s15"><title>Results</title><p>Of 1359 women screened, 1007 women were recruited and started down-regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dew360F1">1</xref>).

Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity in both treatment groups. Two women (0.4%) discontinued treatment with r-hFSH/r-hLH because of TEAEs compared with four (0.8%) patients who discontinued r-hFSH. The TEAEs leading to discontinuation of r-hFSH/r-hLH were ovarian rupture (post-oocyte retrieval ovarian bleeding requiring laparoscopy) and endometrial polyps. The TEAEs leading to discontinuation of r-hFSH were overdose (asymptomatic), herniated cervical vertebral disc, ovarian cyst and ovarian polyp.

Serious TEAEs that occurred in more than one woman were missed abortion, which occurred in one woman treated with r-hFSH/r-hLH and three treated with r-hFSH, and abortion, which occurred in two women treated with r-hFSH. Ectopic pregnancy was reported for one patient receiving r-hFSH. There was no consistent pattern of TEAEs associated with either treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="dew360s16"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ESPART study is the first adequately powered, randomized controlled trial to investigate reproductive outcomes in women with POR undergoing IVF/ICSI, using selection criteria that incorporate the Bologna criteria. With 939 subjects, it is the largest study ever performed in this category of patients. Indeed, it has previously been suggested that it might be unrealistic to expect randomized controlled trials investigating POR to achieve large sample sizes (<xref rid="dew360C26" ref-type="bibr">Papathanasiou, 2014</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of oocytes retrieved following COS (primary outcome) between patients receiving r-hFSH/r-hLH and those receiving r-hFSH alone and, as expected, a low average number of oocytes was retrieved in both groups. This result is contrasted by recent data from a meta-analysis in patients with POR, in which significantly more oocytes were retrieved with r-hFSH/r-hLH versus r-hFSH alone (<xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). However, this meta-analysis did not include patients with POR classified according to the Bologna criteria, instead including studies with heterogeneous definitions of POR (<xref rid="dew360C19" ref-type="bibr">Lehert <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ESPART study did not include the complete ESHRE Bologna criteria, rather a stricter interpretation was applied to remove diagnostic subjectivity, reduce patient heterogeneity, and exclude patients with the worst reproductive prognosis. It included the objective parameters of age, an AMH level of 0.12&#x02013;1.3 ng/ml and a previous ART cycle with &#x02264;3 oocytes retrieved with a conventional stimulation protocol. Furthermore, the study randomized 939 patients stratified by age (&#x0003c;35 or &#x02265;35 years) and study site to ensure adequate statistical power to detect a difference between treatment groups for the primary endpoint, the number of oocytes retrieved, and provide uniform baseline characteristics between the groups.</p><p>In the present study, the live birth rates were similar in both treatment groups (10.6% and 11.7% with r-hFSH/r-hLH and r-hFSH, respectively); interestingly, these rates were considerably higher than the live birth rates (5.5&#x02013;7.4%) reported in retrospective analyses of Bologna poor ovarian responders (<xref rid="dew360C30" ref-type="bibr">Polyzos <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C16" ref-type="bibr">La Marca <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), and even lower live birth rates (2.6% per cycle) when only patients with POR undergoing natural cycle IVF were analysed retrospectively (<xref rid="dew360C28" ref-type="bibr">Polyzos <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). This difference in live birth rate might be attributed to the ESPART study design as a randomized controlled trial with predefined inclusion criteria. Furthermore, it may reflect differences in the COS protocol used in ESPART compared with the studies included in the retrospective analyses.</p><p>Although biochemical pregnancy rates differed between treatment groups, this difference diminished over the course of the pregnancy, with similar live birth rates in both groups. A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis to investigate this difference indicated that the incidence of total pregnancy outcome failure (combination of preclinical miscarriage, early or late spontaneous miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy) was lower in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group than in the r-hFSH group. This observation may relate to the potential beneficial effects of r-hLH supplementation on oocyte &#x02018;quality&#x02019; and/or the capacity of r-hLH to support the pregnancy-sustaining function of the endometrium (<xref rid="dew360C33" ref-type="bibr">Tesarik <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C6" ref-type="bibr">Bosch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). However, these findings should be confirmed in additional studies.</p><p>LH supplementation may reduce the rate of granulosa/cumulus cell apoptosis (a marker of oocyte quality that is positively correlated with female age) <italic>via</italic> increased epiregulin and amphiregulin up-regulation (<xref rid="dew360C18" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C5" ref-type="bibr">Bencomo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C32" ref-type="bibr">Ruvolo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C11" ref-type="bibr">Hill and Propst, 2012</xref>). LH receptors are present in the endometrium during the window of implantation, playing an important role in embryo&#x02013;endometrium cross-talk during implantation (<xref rid="dew360C2" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee and Fazleabas, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="dew360C3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C11" ref-type="bibr">Hill and Propst, 2012</xref>). Moreover, other indirect/direct effects of LH on endometrial function are poorly explored and require more research. The proposed positive effects of LH supplementation on both oocyte quality and endometrial receptivity might also explain significantly increased implantation rates previously observed in patients aged &#x02265;35 years who received r-hLH supplementation to r-hFSH for COS (<xref rid="dew360C13" ref-type="bibr">Humaidan <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C20" ref-type="bibr">Marrs <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C4" ref-type="bibr">Barrenetxea <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C21" ref-type="bibr">Matorras <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C6" ref-type="bibr">Bosch <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="dew360C10" ref-type="bibr">Hill <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Utilization of the Bologna POR criteria leads to a binary decision, (i.e. yes or no) as to whether or not a patient is a poor ovarian responder. However, it may be more useful to quantify the range of POR using ovarian response or reserve as an assessment tool. To this end, a <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory analysis based on the key POR inclusion criteria (age, AMH and previous ART outcome; the BSC analysis) permitted a more detailed investigation of the possible effect of treatment within three distinct subgroups defined according to baseline thresholds. Interestingly, using this concept of BSC and specifically considering live birth, outcomes differed between the treatment groups; r-hFSH/r-hLH showed more promise for the patients with moderate POR (BSC = 1) or severe POR (BSC = 2), and r-hFSH was associated with better outcomes for patients with mild POR (BSC = 0). The mild POR subgroup, representing one-third of the ESPART study population, included a heterogeneous group of patients who met the ESPART inclusion criteria but were younger than 40 years old, with either three or more oocytes in a previous ART cycle or an AMH level &#x0003e;0.5 ng/ml in absence of a previous ART cycle. The analysis showed an interaction between BSC and treatment. However, these data need to be confirmed in additional studies stratifying patients with POR according to age, serum AMH and number of oocytes retrieved in previous ART cycles.</p><p>In conclusion, the ESPART study represents pioneering work in POR and is the largest randomized, controlled study ever performed in women with POR. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of superiority of r-hFSH/r-hLH to r-hFSH in terms of number of oocytes retrieved following COS. Furthermore, the live birth rates per cycle were similar in both groups, but considerably higher than previously reported in retrospective studies that included Bologna POR patients, suggesting that recombinant gonadotropin stimulation protocols represent an effective treatment strategy in this challenging patient category. In addition, <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses indicated that the incidence of total pregnancy outcome failure was significantly lower in the r-hFSH/r-hLH group than in the r-hFSH group and that live birth rate was associated with both treatment type (r-hFSH/r-hLH or r-hFSH) and POR baseline characteristics. Collectively, these data suggest that r-hFSH/r-hLH treatment may have added clinical value compared with r-hFSH alone in a subset of women with POR, but additional studies are needed to validate and confirm these observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="dew360s17"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>
