Our second specific study aim was to assess whether media types (ePaper vs mobile) were associated with different levels of compliance and adherence to wellness programs.

Together, these findings suggest that the mobile app allowed a more accurate method to report and track health behaviors over a longer period than traditional ePaper-based diaries or log books. There was a significant difference in the overall compliance score for Mobile-Solo (Mean [SD] 0.30 [0.39]) and Mobile-Team (Mean [SD] 0.49 [0.35]) conditions (<italic>t</italic>

Survival analysis showed that participants assigned to Team conditions are 66% more likely to engage longer with mHealth app-based intervention than those assigned to the Solo condition. Overall, participants across all groups reported some positive changes in eating behavior, physical activity, and stress level; however, participants in the Mobile-Solo condition reported higher perceived stress levels at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The team-based Fittle app is an acceptable and feasible wellness behavior change intervention and a full randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of such an intervention is warranted.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mobile phone</kwd><kwd>app</kwd><kwd>social support</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title> Introduction</title><p>It is no longer news that US health care costs are staggering and that a major driver of these increased costs are unhealthy behaviors such as physical inactivity, increased food intake, and unhealthful food choices [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which are potentially preventable by health behavior change. In this context, existing formal programs (both primary care and commercial) and one-on-one coaching can be effective in producing behavior change and desirable health outcomes [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, these programs typically have bottlenecks in providing sufficient numbers of expert counselors and personalized day-to-day support to a large population for a long period of time. There is a pressing need to extend the reach of existing health behavior change techniques in areas such as diet and fitness and to intensify and prolong their impact.</p><p>Additionally, changing behavior and sustaining it over the long term has been proven to be very difficult and it is suggested that novel methods of promoting self-monitoring and social support are needed to ensure long-term maintenance of behavior change [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Social- and group/team-based behavior-change techniques have been shown to be effective in supporting behavior change in areas such as long-term weight loss [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mobile phones may now be providing a platform to scale and disseminate effective group support for sustainable health behavior change [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although eHealth approaches often suffer from the &#x0201c;Law of Attrition&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] wherein there is a high attrition rate among participants, team identification and interpersonal accountability may ameliorate such attrition. Mobile phones are increasingly prevalent in everyday life and are increasingly used for multiple forms of online social interaction. In this study, we sought to directly investigate the effects of team-based social support in a nutrition and exercise program delivered by an mHealth application called Fittle.</p><sec><title>Social Support in Behavior Change Interventions</title><p>Social support may potentially help sustain engagement with health behavior change interventions and consequently increase efficacy. An observational study of more than 80,000 users in the context of a Web-based health promotion intervention [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] revealed that increased social ties within this challenge community directly predicted online engagement and activity completion [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In order to systematically characterize the role of social support in enhancing the efficacy of the intervention, a recent study compared a structured physical activity intervention comprising education, activity monitoring, and online social networking via a Facebook group versus an education-only control [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite the lack of difference between intervention and control groups in physical activity levels post-intervention, the authors did find that the attrition levels for participants in the online intervention group were significantly lower than that of the education-only control group at 12 weeks. Likewise, in another study, it was found that weight loss in a 6-month, remotely delivered weight-loss intervention was strongly associated with engagement within an online Twitter-based social network wherein participants provided each other with informational support [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similar results were found in a Web-based weight-loss program where social networking and personalized recommendations did not demonstrate additive effects for user weight loss or retention, but these features increased the average number of days that a user engaged with the system [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More recently, Pechmann et al [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] studied the effectiveness of automatic messages delivered to small online groups via Twitter on abstinence from smoking. They found that specific tweet content about quitting was strongly related to abstinence along with high engagement from users over a period of 100 days.</p><p>The concept of social support has also been incorporated into many commercial mobile phone-based health behavior change applications, such as MyFitnessPal, WeightWatchers. In these apps, social support is usually built around the user&#x02019;s personal social network, such as Facebook or Twitter friends. However, it is not clear whether a social community of this kind is the one best suited for health behavior change. While family and friends might be a good source of emotional support, they might not necessarily have the same level of motivation to engage in health behavior change programs, and they might also not be able to provide the kind of quality informational support that is an important factor in successful behavior change programs [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Further, although social support has health benefits in its own right [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and increases participation in exercise programs [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], building successful groups to support health-related interventions is not automatic. For example, in an effort to test the effects of an online community for helping people to quit smoking, researchers gave 684 people access to an online community in addition to the informational website Smokefree.gov. However, so few people used the online community features that the researchers were not able to report on its effectiveness [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are a few previous studies that aimed to understand the effects of a social network [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the potential of a social mobile phone application in improving physical activity level [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, both of these studies focused more on the usability aspects of the behavior change systems and no data on the effects of social support were reported.</p><p>In this study, instead of forming social groups from a person&#x02019;s existing social network, we aim to explore the feasibility of creating an effective behavior-change social group by randomly grouping people who are interested in healthy behavior-change programs into a &#x0201c;team.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Mobile Phone-Based Behavior Change Interventions</title><p>Mobile phone-based self-monitoring applications have been found to be effective in improving adherence. For example, My Meal Mate (MMM), a mobile weight-loss app developed on Android, allows users to set goals, self-monitor diet and activity, and receive feedback via a weekly text message. In that study, adherence to the mobile phone-based intervention was found to be the highest [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as compared to paper or Web-based interventions.</p><p>However, most of the behavior change content in existing formal programs (both primary care and commercial) and one-on-one coaching are still paper-based. Previous research has shown that a mobile diary was slightly more preferred, but the inability to backfill missing entries resulted in a large prevalence of missing data [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the sample size of that study was very small (N=12). Thus, a secondary aim of this study was to better understand how the mobile phone-based functionality of an mHealth application differed from a usual-care approach of providing paper-based content and requiring paper journaling. In this study, a PDF version of the program is sent to participants in the paper conditions. They can choose to either view the PDF file on their computers or print it out. In this study, we call it &#x0201c;ePaper&#x0201d; journaling.</p><p>Earlier work [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported on a mobile phone-based app, Fittle, which includes functionality to promote online group-based support for individuals to progress through behavior-change programs called &#x0201c;challenges.&#x0201d; The challenges are designed to help people master one health-improving habit after another, in a way that builds on previous achievements. Fittle provides a built-in, private social networking feature that allows users to work and engage with their team members so that they can support each other as they learn and adopt new, healthier habits (details about the application are described below). Fittle incorporates a number of evidence-based techniques that are motivated by the theory of planned behavior and social cognitive theory to positively impact health behavior change. Moreover, these interventions can be delivered at low cost because the scaffolding for individual success is either automated or provided through peer support.</p><p>The study in Du et al [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was not designed to systematically study the effects of having team support as all participants were assigned to teams. However, hierarchical regression analyses, including team as a mediating factor, and post-hoc analyses of the impact of team interactions on outcomes were both strongly suggestive of an association between teams, program adherence, and health outcomes. In this current feasibility study, we specifically aimed to compare the Fittle mobile phone-based health behavior change program administered in a solo versus group environment. We hypothesized that using a theory-guided, group/team-based behavior change mobile app (Mobile-Team condition) will result in higher adherence, more improved eating habits, reduced stress, and improved fitness level compared to Mobile-Solo, ePaper-Team, and ePaper-Solo conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Fittle</title><p>Fittle is implemented as a client-server architecture running on both iOS and Android. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> shows several screens of Fittle. The initial experience starts with a presentation of a selection of available challenges. These challenges are either conversions of existing programs that have been developed over the years or new programs created by professionals. The app platform is designed to support open content creation by anyone (under some quality control review process). After challenge selection, a user can either join an existing team (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>a) or create a new one and invite teammates via email. The selection of a challenge and membership in a team opens the primary Fittle dashboard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>c).</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fittle mobile application screens: (a) teams available, (b) the details of a team, (c) activity information, (d) overall goals for this week, and (e) the team-based social activity feed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v4i1e4_fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Activities in Fittle</title><p>The Fittle dashboard consists of 3 parts. The top portion shows the activities (or goals) as part of the challenge that the user should complete on that given day (ie, today). An icon represents each of these goals with a completion status shown below as a set of circles similar to a horizontal traffic light. Tap selection of the activity icons (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>c) opens up the title, basic reminder details, the ability to substitute the task for another, a link to more detailed information about the activity that is presented as an electronic card (which may include video demonstration, images, detailed instructions, substitution suggestions, background information, external reference links, links to other related Fittle cards, and more), and the ability to self-report completion and submit a multimedia-enabled post to the team activity feed related to the selected activity. Users can also navigate back and forth in time by tapping the arrows associated with the day display. Users may update reports on past activities, but not on future scheduled activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Progress Tracking</title><p>The middle section of the dashboard provides visual analytics showing the user&#x02019;s and the team&#x02019;s goal accomplishment for the current week. A details button next to the progress bars opens a weekly activity set view, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>d, showing the user all activities that Fittle will schedule for them in the coming week with visual completion details.</p></sec><sec><title>Team Interaction</title><p>An activity-posting bar is always present in the dashboard and provides a means for the user to share multimedia posts with the team at any time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>e). Text whispers (ie, the faint text that appears in text entry fields before the user enters anything) in all open text fields invite the user to share information with the team. Users may also communicate directly with each other through a peer-to-peer messaging system.</p><p>All teams also include an artificial intelligence agent as a member, named &#x0201c;FittleBot.&#x0201d; FittleBot provides daily tips to the team relevant to their activities, previews the activities for the week, and comments on the daily activities of the team members as a group.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges</title><p>In this feasibility study, we featured 2 8-week challenges developed in collaboration with 2 certified experts in personal training and nutrition consulting. These challenges promoted 3 classes of behavior: nutrition, walking, and stress relieving workouts [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The challenges consisted of a beginner-level program to get people moving more called &#x0201c;NutriWalking&#x0201d; and a workout focusing on relieving stress called &#x0201c;StressBusting.&#x0201d; Both challenges contained 4 nutrition activities: eat slowly, add a serving of vegetables (or a different vegetable if a vegetarian), add a small healthy meal while reducing the others, and keep a food diary. These activities were offered for 2 to 3 weeks each with overlap in the transition week from one habit to the next.</p><p>NutriWalking focused on getting participants to walk more, starting with 15 minutes 3 times a week on flat surfaces and ramping up to 45 minutes 5 times a week on inclined surfaces with some exercises (eg, jumping jacks) or short jogging sessions added to the walk. For off days, stretching was suggested. The system dynamically adjusted a user&#x02019;s schedule and recommendations if he or she deferred certain activities and/or substituted walking days.</p><p>StressBusting focused on 3 scheduled workouts during the week. Mondays comprised an upper body workout consisting of 5 exercises with easier alternatives that focused on strengthening the upper body and core (eg, chest presses, push-ups, high planks, rows). Wednesdays focused on a full body workout consisting of 5 exercises with easier alternatives that focused on muscle endurance (eg, goblet squats, rotation push-ups, jumping rope, mountain climbers, burpees). Finally, Fridays comprised a lower body workout consisting of 5 exercises with easier alternatives that focused on strengthening the lower body and core (eg, deadlifts, squats, supine hip exercises, lunges, ball chops). Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays were recovery days where participants were asked to engage in a fun and nonstressful activity to get them moving. Sundays were complete rest days. This program was designed on a schedule with the caveat that if a day was missed, it would not be a big deal and there was no need to make it up&#x02014;users were just asked to keep moving forward without any worry or stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Hypotheses</title><p>We had 4 research hypotheses (RHs) concerning participants&#x02019; compliance, adherence, and the effectiveness of Fittle.</p><sec><title>RH1: Higher Compliance in Mobile Conditions</title><p>The fact that the Fittle app is always available to people on their mobile phones should induce greater compliance. Compliance is defined as the percentage of activities that have been reported as &#x0201c;completed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;partially completed.&#x0201d; For example, if 100 activities were recommended to a user and 90 of the activities were reported as &#x0201c;completed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;partially completed,&#x0201d; the compliance rate is 90%.</p></sec><sec><title>RH2: Higher Compliance in Team Conditions</title><p>Participants in team conditions should have higher levels of compliance due to increased social interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>RH3: Greater Adherence in Team Conditions</title><p>Participants in team conditions should have greater adherence to the program due to increased social interactions. Adherence is measured by the number of weeks before a participant becomes inactive (not report any activities for an entire week) in Fittle. For example, if a user always reported some activities from week 1 to week 3, and in week 4 the user did not report any activities, the adherence of this user is 3 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>RH4: Superior Outcomes in the Mobile-Team Condition</title><p>Participants in the Mobile-Team condition should show the greatest improvements on our 3 outcome measures (eg, stress reduction, improved eating habits, and increased physical activity) due to higher compliance and greater adherence.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We designed a 2 &#x000d7; 2 (Mobile vs ePaper &#x000d7; Team vs Solo) factorial design feasibility study to compare the compliance, adherence, and outcomes impact of the team-based (as opposed to solo), mobile app-administered (as opposed to ePaper) health behavior modification challenges.</p><p>We will run a 2 &#x000d7; 2 (Mobile vs ePaper &#x000d7; Team vs Solo) analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis to test RH1 and RH2. For RH3, we will conduct a survival analysis to test the hypothesis that participants assigned to teams (Mobile Team) have greater adherence to the program, controlling for their perceived system usability and attitudes toward the system. To test RH4, we will run a series of 2 &#x000d7; 2 (Media: ePaper vs Mobile &#x000d7; Group Type: Solo vs Team) mixed effects analyses of covariance (ANCOVA). The challenges (StressBusting or NutriWalking) will be modeled as random effects and participants&#x02019; attitude toward the Fittle program is modeled as a covariate.</p><sec><title>Recruitment Strategy</title><p>As in Heffner et al [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], participants were recruited using Web-based recruitment methods by advertising through Craigslist, Mechanical Turk, Google Adwords, Reddit, and Facebook, separately for the NutriWalking and StressBusting challenges. Advertising material encouraged participants to visit the study information website (NutriWalking or StressBusting study website), which included a brief overview of the study. Individuals interested in the study (challenge) then filled out a screening survey on this website. Individuals were eligible for this study if they: (1) were aged 18 or older, (2) were physically capable of performing the exercises in this study (ie, answered yes to all questions on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], (3) had either an Apple iPhone or an Android phone, (4) resided in the United States, and (5) were willing to commit the necessary time and effort to the study. Participants who completed the pre- and post-surveys were compensated with a US $20 Amazon gift card.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Individuals who passed the initial screening were randomly assigned into 1 of the 4 conditions (eg, ePaper Solo, ePaper Team, Mobile Solo, and Mobile Team) using randomizer.org [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Individuals assigned to the ePaper Team and Mobile Team conditions were further randomly assigned into different teams. The teams were created by researchers and were designed to be 12-person groups. Next, participants were emailed a pre-survey. Individuals who completed the pre-survey were included in the study. However, not every individual completed the pre-survey after they were assigned into teams; thus, team sizes ended up being unequal. The final sample consisted of 124 participants (N=66 in NutriWalking; N=58 in StressBusting). Participants were blind to the condition they were in and were not informed that there were different conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref> shows the overall flow of the study.</p><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Study flow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v4i1e4_fig2"/></fig><sec><title>ePaper Solo Condition</title><p>Participants in the ePaper Solo (total N=35; N=16 in NutriWalking; N=19 in StressBusting) condition were emailed a PDF version of the wellness program.</p></sec><sec><title>ePaper Team Condition</title><p>Participants in the ePaper Team condition (total N=31; N=17 in NutriWalking; N=14 in StressBusting) were emailed the same PDF version of the wellness program.

In order to do this, we surveyed the responders (ie, completers of the post-survey, N=89). Participants were asked questions in a short follow-up survey to help characterize their reporting behaviors in terms of various time frames relative to challenge activity completion (ie, same day, next day, within 1 week, more than 1 week, and end of study). Participants indicated at which time points they reported/recorded their activity completion, how confident they felt about their report at each of those time points (measured on a 5-point Likert scale, with responses ranging from Very Unsure to Very Sure), and whether they guessed while reporting (measured with a simple yes/no response). Out of 89, N=63 participants completed this survey; N=33 in ePaper and N=30 in Mobile conditions. It is important to note that this survey was specifically agnostic to medium of reporting and did not prime participants in any way about that factor.</p><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>, a clear dissociation between participants in the Mobile and ePaper conditions emerged, as participants in Mobile conditions reported their compliance with a much higher frequency closer to the time of challenge activity completion (2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test comparing distributions was highly significant; KS (N=63) = 0.3254, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001). On the contrary, participants in the ePaper condition appeared to report their compliance with a constant frequency regardless of temporal proximity to challenge activity completion.</p><p>Further, when probed about their confidence in their own compliance report, participants in the Mobile condition again clearly differentiated themselves from those in the ePaper condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure5">Figure 5</xref>). Their confidence progressively decreased, as the time of reporting grew distant from the challenge activity completion time point, which could be indicative of honesty in their reporting behaviors. In contrast, participants in the ePaper condition appeared to have relatively high confidence throughout all time points of reporting regardless of when challenge activity was completed. A Kruskal-Wallis test comparing medians at each of the 5 time points (&#x003b1;=0.01 adjusted for multiple comparisons) was highly significant for the later time points, namely less than 1 week, &#x003c7;<sub>1</sub>

To understand whether being in a team induced higher compliance than being alone, we compared Mobile Solo vs Mobile Team conditions. We first examined the overall compliance between the 2 conditions. Overall compliance was defined as the average compliance across 8 weeks (ie, challenge duration). There was a significant difference in the overall compliance score for Mobile Solo (mean [SD] 0.30 [0.39]) and Mobile Team (mean [SD] 0.49 [0.35]) conditions (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>50.82</sub>=1.94, <italic>P</italic>=.05). This suggests that working in a team increased participants&#x02019; overall compliance within Fittle.</p><p>We further examined the distribution of the overall compliance in Mobile Solo and Mobile Team conditions. A kernel density plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure7">Figure 7</xref>) showed that overall compliance in both Mobile Solo and Mobile Team conditions interestingly follows a bimodal distribution. Most participants in the Mobile Solo condition had a very low overall compliance (left modal) and very few participants in the Mobile Solo condition had a high overall compliance (right modal). However, in the Mobile Team condition, the proportion of participants whose overall compliance was around the left modal was reduced and most participants&#x02019; overall compliance was around 0.75 (right modal). This dichotomy in the distribution of overall compliance across Team versus Solo conditions suggests that the team social support-based intervention is more likely to shift individual user compliance closer to the team mean (ie, increase individual compliance). The challenge therefore to design more effective socially based health behavior interventions is to focus on increasing overall mean compliance in teams/groups of participants.</p><fig id="figure7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Kernel Density plots of average weekly compliance showing a bimodal distribution for both Mobile-Solo (Red) and Mobile-Team (Green) conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v4i1e4_fig7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>RH3: Greater Adherence in Team Conditions</title><p>Based on the self-reported compliance data, adherence of the ePaper groups was high. The average adherence rate of the ePaper Solo group was 0.97 and ePaper Team group was 0.85 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). However, given the low confidence in the compliance report in the ePaper conditions, we chose to focus the analysis on the Mobile conditions.</p><p>We applied survival analysis to test the hypothesis that participants assigned to teams (Mobile Team) have greater adherence to the program, controlling for perceived system usability and attitudes toward the system. In the present study, the event of interest is the time at which a user disengaged from Fittle. This analysis predicted the length of engagement in Fittle based on whether users worked in teams and other control variables.</p><p>We considered a participant to have disengaged if they stopped reporting compliance data for an entire week (ie, the compliance of a week is zero). Participants who were engaged until the end of the 8-week study were treated as right censored in the survival analysis.</p><p>

The hazard ratio for Attitude indicates that survival rates are 32% higher for those who had a positive Attitude at least 1 standard deviation greater than average, when all other variables were at their average levels.

Overall, these results suggest that the ePaper-based intervention outperformed the mobile delivery of the intervention in helping participants achieve the health outcomes in this feasibility study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title> Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Results</title><p>In this project, we studied a novel, low-cost, group-based mobile phone health and wellness application called Fittle. The intervention combined the traditional daily activities suggestions/prompts with real-time, peer-to-peer social support that encouraged discussions consistent with guidelines for behavior change for health and wellness [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and online community building [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More importantly, this application encouraged and helped users to learn and master new, healthier habits progressively over the 8-week period.</p><p>Our first specific study aim was to explore if social support improved adherence. Participants in the Mobile Team condition reported higher compliance to the program compared to those in the Mobile Solo condition. Our survival analysis showed that participants assigned to the Team condition are 66% more likely to engage longer than those assigned to the Solo condition. Furthermore, participants&#x02019; overall attitude toward the program had a significant effect on participants&#x02019; adherence, which supports the notion that efforts to enhance positive attitudes toward these health behavior change programs can greatly increase their impact.</p><p>Our second specific study aim was to assess whether media types (ePaper vs Mobile) were associated with different levels of compliance and adherence to wellness programs. We found that participants in the ePaper conditions reported a much higher compliance score. However, the confidence in the compliance report in the ePaper condition was much lower than in the Mobile condition, while the attrition rate was higher in the ePaper condition. One major factor that could have led to this behavioral discrepancy between the 2 conditions is that the affordance of the Mobile app is much lower to support back-reporting in time, which is not the case with the ePaper workbook. This could have led to possible over-reporting in the ePaper condition precisely due to the easy access of the entire ePaper workbook.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those of Stone and colleagues [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] who also found that patients maintaining ePaper medication diaries showed a higher frequency of back-reporting or &#x0201c;hoarding.&#x0201d; These results may provide additional support for the use of mobile diaries for patients/users wherein closer tracking of long-term behaviors are required. It also highlights the need for objective measurement of adherence to behavioral treatment regimens, which in the context of physical activity interventions can potentially be achieved with wearable activity trackers.</p><p>The third aim was to assess whether the use of Fittle led to positive changes to participants&#x02019; eating behaviors, physical activity, and stress level. The results revealed that participants all reported some positive changes in Healthy Eating, Perceived Stress Scale, and MET, except that participants in the Mobile Solo condition reported higher Perceived Stress Scale at the end of the study. No significant effects of media or team type were found for the changes observed in Perceived Stress Scale and MET. However, as for Healthy Eating, participants in ePaper conditions reported more improvements than participants in Mobile conditions. The reason for these results is unclear, and it is not explainable given our study design. One possibility is that the higher attrition in the ePaper groups could have been related to less motivated participants dropping out, leaving a more-motivated ePaper cohort to participate for the study duration. On the contrary, the mobile app may have retained a less-motivated cohort who would have otherwise had less compliance and, consequently, these less-motivated participants did not see the expected health benefits.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Generalizability of the initial findings from this feasibility study is limited given that the sample was mostly white and female. Moreover, recruitment through online advertisements resulted in a selection bias with more highly educated people being involved in the study, which is in line with the results from previous reviews indicating that mainly higher educated individuals participate in online interventions [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This further precludes the generalizability of our study results.</p><p>The overall attrition rate of this study was 28.2% (35/124). Missing data may indicate a participant&#x02019;s dissatisfaction with the program. In this study, attrition was not equal among the conditions, with attrition in the ePaper conditions being higher than the Mobile conditions. The attrition rate in the ePaper conditions was about 36.4% (24/66). However, in the mobile conditions (Mobile Solo and Mobile Team), the attrition rate was 18.9% (11/58), which is in line with results from recent reviews that indicated that the average attrition rate in Internet-based physical activity interventions is about 20% [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this is much higher than the 7% attrition rate reported in mobile phone-based interventions [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This higher attrition rate may be due to the fact that the Fittle app was a work-in-progress app. Participants held more positive attitudes toward the ePaper-based program than the app-based program. This may have affected participant engagement. Currently, we are working on redesigning these components to improve user experience and accessibility of the health tips-based electronic cards, which could help increase participant engagement in future interventions.</p><p>Due to the higher than expected attrition rate, the absolute sample size at the post survey was low, especially for the self-reported compliance, Healthy Eating, Perceived Stress Scale, and MET data. This reduced statistical power could have also partly precluded detection of any intervention effects in the post survey on self-reported Healthy Eating, Perceived Stress Scale, and MET data.</p><p>Finally, our initial research design strived to create equal-sized teams. However, not every participant who qualified to participate actually joined the study and the teams ended up having different sizes. In a future clinical trial, the design would need to be altered to address the team size issue and to potentially include analytical approaches to stratify and weight teams based on size while examining intervention efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications and Future Research</title><p>The results from this study provide additional evidence to support the role of positive social/group effect on participants&#x02019; adherence in mobile phone-based wellness programs. The sizes of the teams range from 3 to 9 participants. However due to the small number of teams, we did not get much insight into the optimal size of the teams. Future studies on the effects of team sizes on adherence and best practices to organize effective teams are necessary.</p><p>Moreover, it should be noted that the Mobile conditions received different forms of social interactions and support (ie, interactions with other participants in Fittle, FittleBot-provided daily tips). However, our study design does not allow us to determine whether all components are equally effective and whether their combination is necessary. Future studies should separate the different intervention components in order to assess their individual impact. Furthermore, recent research suggests that prompts via auto-messages to stimulate social interactions within groups helps significantly increase participation in socially based health behavior change interventions [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, further research is necessary to help design more targeted prompts within our mobile phone application to most effectively increase participant engagement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, in this initial study examining effectiveness of a group-based mobile phone wellness program, we demonstrated that having people work in teams led to a significantly higher level of adherence and engagement over time. Positive changes in participants&#x02019; eating patterns, perceived stress, and physical activity levels were reported. We believe that these findings are very promising and should encourage future research to investigate and characterize the role of objective measures of participants&#x02019; adherence and social support in mobile phone-based wellness programs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was partially funded by a National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health grant (grant number 1346066), and partially funded by Xerox.
