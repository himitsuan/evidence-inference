<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Violence is also recognised as a leading global public health problem and makes a substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality with high social and economic costs (WHO, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Juvenile delinquency and antisocial behaviour in adulthood can often be traced back to early childhood. Young children who have conduct problems (which describes a range of antisocial behaviours including oppositional, aggressive, dishonest and disruptive behaviours) are not only more likely to have continued antisocial and aggressive behaviour in later childhood and adolescence, but they are more likely to experience academic failure and early school drop-out and to engage in crime and violence in adulthood (Moffitt &#x00026; Scott, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Interventions to prevent and reduce conduct problems in early childhood are thus an integral component of violence prevention programmes.</p><p>Schools offer a logical setting for implementing preventative interventions for young children, and school-based violence prevention programmes show significant benefits to children's violent and aggressive behaviour in high-income countries (Hahn <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wilson &#x00026; Lipsey, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). One type of violence prevention programme involves training teachers in classroom behaviour management, (for example, how to create a nurturing and supportive classroom environment, how to prevent and manage child behaviour problems and how to promote children's social and emotional competence), and a recent meta-analysis showed that these programs, when implemented in primary school, benefit multiple child outcomes including academic achievement, behaviour, social&#x02013;emotional skills and motivation (Korpershoek <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Benefits of such interventions have also been found in pre-primary contexts: a meta-analysis of interventions focused on training caregivers in centre-based services for preschool children found benefits to caregiver&#x02013;child interaction, classroom quality and child social&#x02013;emotional development (Werner <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Training staff in early childhood centres in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) may be particularly important given the evidence that aggression and disruptive behaviour can increase on exposure to poorer quality preschool environments (Aboud, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Bernal &#x00026; Fernandez, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). There is limited evidence of such interventions from LMIC (Baker-Henningham, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) where schools often have less well-trained teachers and lower levels of resources.</p><p>We conducted a pilot study of the Incredible Years (IY) teacher-training programme and a curriculum unit on social&#x02013;emotional skills in Jamaican preschools and found benefits to teacher practices and classroom atmosphere (Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>) and to teacher reported behaviour of children with initial higher levels of behaviour problems (Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>). In-depth interviews with teachers showed that the intervention was acceptable to teachers (Baker-Henningham &#x00026; Walker, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Throughout the pilot study, we documented teachers&#x02019; engagement with the programme on an ongoing basis. During each workshop, the co-facilitator recorded information including: (i) how teachers responded to the new material, (ii) any difficulties teachers showed in understanding and performing the skills taught and (iii) teachers&#x02019; feedback on their use of strategies. The facilitator and co-facilitator also completed self and peer-evaluations of each workshop that included detailed reflections of teachers&#x02019; engagement with the material. In addition, after each in-class support session, the coach documented the strengths and needs of each individual teacher based on her own observations and her discussions with the teacher. These data, combined with the data from the qualitative and quantitative evaluation, were used to adapt the IY teacher-training programme to enhance its relevance to teachers working in low-resource settings. The content was similar to the original programme but significant adaptations were made to the materials and the method of delivery of the intervention. Further details of the rationale for adapting the programme, the source of the evidence underpinning this rationale and the nature of the adaptations made are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>. This adapted programme was evaluated, in a cluster-randomised trial in 24 preschools, for its effect on the behaviour of children who were at high risk for developing conduct problems. Significant benefits were found in terms of reduced conduct problems by independent observations [effect size (ES)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.42], teacher report (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.47) and parent report (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.22); increased social skills by independent observations (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.74) and teacher report (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.59) and increased school attendance (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.30) (Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>

The preschools were situated in disadvantaged, low SES areas with high levels of community violence. Community preschools cater to children aged 3&#x02013;6 years and are provided through a partnership between community organisation (often churches) and the government. Parents are expected to provide school resources (e.g. books, pencils, crayons) in addition to paying a small fee. Preschool was the unit of randomisation to prevent contamination between teachers and because the teacher-training intervention was believed to be more effective if all teachers in a school were trained thus leading to changes in the schools&#x02019; culture. Preschools were eligible for inclusion if they had 3&#x02013;4 classes of children, at least 20 children per class, were situated in a specified geographical area and if all teachers consented to participate in the trial. All community schools in three education zones within Kingston were surveyed and in schools with the required number of classes and children, the PI met with the principal to provide information about the study. If the principal was interested in participating in the trial, a further meeting was held with all teachers in the school to describe the study and address any questions and concerns, prior to asking for teachers&#x02019; consent. Twenty-four out of fifty preschools approached met all inclusion criteria and were recruited into the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Trial profile. *Analysis was intention to treat; baseline scores substituted for missing post-test data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S2054425117000292_fig1"/></fig></p><p>Children with high initial levels of conduct problems were selected for evaluation. An interviewer-administered screening questionnaire was conducted with each class teacher in all study schools. The screen used 10 items from the ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research for conduct disorder (WHO, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), (loses temper, back chats, disobedient/breaks rules, annoys others, blames others, easily annoyed, often angry, spiteful to others, fights or bullies and destroys property), and teachers rated each child in their class according to a four-point scale: not true, just a little true, pretty much true and very much true. The three children with the highest scores on this screen from each class were recruited into the evaluation component of the study. Children were excluded from the evaluation if they had a school attendance &#x0003c;70%, a developmental disability, lived in an institution or if they had a sibling who had already been enrolled into the study. A total of 225 children, aged 3&#x02013;6 years, were recruited into the study, 113 from intervention schools and 112 from control schools. The focus of this paper is on teacher's behaviour to the whole class and the selected children and to class-wide child behaviour. The effect of intervention on individual child outcomes was reported previously (Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The University of the West Indies Ethics Committee approved the trial. Written informed consent was obtained from the preschool principals, all teachers and from the parents of the selected children prior to recruitment into the study. The study is registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register: ISRCTN35476268.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study was powered based on the primary outcome of observed child behaviour (Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For measures of teacher's behaviour to the whole class and classroom atmosphere, with 30 teachers per group, a cluster size of three teachers per school and assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.25, we could detect an intervention effect of 1 <sc>s.d.</sc> with 85% power at 0.05 level of significance. We hypothesised a large ES on these outcomes based on the results of the pilot study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>).

We dedicated less workshop time to watching video vignettes followed by discussion and more time on practical activities such as role plays and group work. Role plays and group activities were designed both to teach new concepts and skills and to help teachers practice and generalise previously introduced skills. These activities were based on scenarios common in Jamaican preschools. Card-sorting activities were designed to help teachers learn unfamiliar content (e.g. sorting labelled and unlabelled praise statements). Video vignettes were mostly of Jamaican preschool classrooms, supplemented by the original vignettes as necessary. New simplified handouts and classroom assignments were prepared with content and activities reflecting the Jamaican preschool context. Furthermore, new materials and activities were added to cater to the needs of teachers, many of whom had limited training, with a particular focus on classroom organisation skills and using play and interactive activities in teaching (especially in the context of limited resources, overcrowding and high child/staff ratios). New materials and activities were also designed to help teachers to fully integrate social and emotional skills into daily teaching and learning activities.

For the analyses of the effect of intervention on teacher's behaviour to the whole class, class-wide child behaviour outcomes and ratings of classroom atmosphere at post-test, baseline score and intervention group were entered as fixed effects and school was added as a random effect. In the analyses on teacher behaviour to target children, child age and sex, baseline score and group were entered as fixed effects and school and teacher were entered as random effects. All outcomes at follow-up were at the level of the classroom/teacher; group was entered as a fixed effect and school as a random effect.

In the pilot study, the IY teacher-training intervention was implemented with few adaptations, unlike in the current study in which significant changes were made. The proportion of trained teachers and class sizes were similar in both studies. The schools in the pilot study scored 0.43 <sc>s.d.</sc> higher on the space and furnishings subscale of the ECERS and 1.25 <sc>s.d.</sc> higher on the activities subscale indicating a greater level of resources. However, ECERS scores for both studies were in the minimal range. The intervention used in the pilot study was more intensive and included seven full-day workshops and a total of 21 in-class support sessions with each teacher with 14 of these also working directly with the children teaching a curriculum unit on social and emotional skills (in collaboration with the teacher); in the current study the number of workshops was similar (8 full-day workshops) but teachers received only four in-class support sessions. In both the pilot study and the current study, the intervention was acceptable to teachers as shown by attendance and satisfaction ratings and large benefits were found to teacher behaviour and class-wide child behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>An adapted version of an evidence-based programme aimed at training teachers in appropriate classroom management techniques in order to reduce child conduct problems and promote child competencies led to large benefits to Jamaican preschool teachers&#x02019; behaviour to the whole class and to children at high risk for developing conduct problems, to class-wide child behaviour and to classroom atmosphere. These benefits were sustained at 6-month follow-up.</p><p>The study shows that professional development training in classroom behaviour management for preschool teachers in LMIC has the potential to make large improvements to teachers&#x02019; behaviours resulting in a more emotionally supportive classroom environment and reduced harsh punishment by teachers for all children and improved class-wide child behaviour. Violence against children in schools is common in many LMIC and yet the evidence base for effective interventions is sparse. We are aware of only one trial: in primary schools in Uganda, a school-wide intervention involving staff, students and the school administration reduced past week physical violence against children by 42% (Devries <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Importantly, benefits in the current study were found not only for teachers&#x02019; behaviour to the whole class but also to teachers&#x02019; behaviour to children at high risk for developing conduct problems. Increased positive attention and reduced negative attention to these children may have limited the escalating cycles of coercive behaviour between teachers and antisocial children (Patterson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), and this is likely to be a key mechanism in the reductions in child conduct problems and increases in social skills found for these children (Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In addition, due to the benefits to class-wide child behaviour, children at high risk for developing conduct disorder in intervention schools would be exposed to less aggression and increased appropriate behaviour from peers which may have also contributed to their improved behaviour at school and at home (Kellam <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Benefits were also found to class-wide child interest and enthusiasm in learning activities and this increased participation is likely to lead to greater school bonding and increased learning, which are key predictors of improved behaviour (O'Donell <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Benefits to teachers&#x02019; behaviours and to class-wide child behaviour were sustained at a 6-month follow-up. This trial is important to the global agenda on violence prevention in two main ways: (i) by reducing harsh punishment by teachers concurrently and at 6-month follow-up and (ii) by reducing conduct problems in children at high-risk of developing antisocial behaviour thus reducing future violence through early prevention. The sustained benefits of the intervention are promising as if teachers continue using the strategies, there are potential benefits to new cohorts of children. It will be important to determine if the benefits to teacher practices from interventions such as this are sustained over the long term and how frequently booster-training sessions may be required to ensure teachers continue to use the skills.</p><p>Benefits to teacher behaviour to the whole class were large compared to previous studies. For example, benefits from the IY teacher-training programme in the USA have been in the range 0.49&#x02013;0.67 for ratings of harsh/critical practices and 0.51 for positive practices (Webster-Stratton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), although large benefits were found for ratings of social-emotional teaching (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.96) and effective discipline (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.24) (Webster-Stratton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In the meta-analysis by Werner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), training caregivers in early childhood settings led to medium effect sizes for caregiver&#x02013;child interaction (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.44) and classroom quality (ES&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.39). Benefits were likely larger in the current study due to the low level of initial training of the teachers thus widening the differences between the groups with intervention. For example, the largest effect sizes were found for the teacher behaviours that were less common in the Jamaican preschool context (teacher positives to the whole class and teacher provides opportunities to share and help). This explanation is also supported by the finding that in the IY teacher-training programme in the USA, effects sizes on critical behaviour for teachers more than 2 <sc>s.d.</sc> above the mean at baseline were 1.37 (compared to 0.49 for the entire sample) (Webster-Stratton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). One study examined benefits of teacher training and consultation on teachers&#x02019; behaviour to children at high risk for aggression and found benefits to the amount of teacher feedback to these high-risk children with effect sizes of 0.46&#x02013;0.62 (The Metropolitan Area Child Study Research Group &#x00026; Gorman-Smith, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), which are in a similar range to those found in this study.</p><p>This study also adds to the debate about the transportability of evidence-based child mental health interventions. Although we are aware of no studies empirically investigating the transportability of teacher interventions across cultures and contexts, meta-analytical studies of parenting interventions have mixed results with van Mourik <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) reporting increased effectiveness for ethnic minority families if interventions are adapted to fit the cultural context, whereas Gardner <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) found that interventions were at least as effective when transported across countries, suggesting that extensive adaption is not required. We chose to use the IY teacher-training programme as its collaborative nature makes it inherently adaptable and culturally sensitive and the IY programmes have been shown to be effective in multiple countries and with a range of ethnic groups (Menting <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, despite this in-built cultural flexibility, we found that an adapted version of the programme required significantly less in-class support for teachers than a minimally adapted version (4 sessions <italic>v.</italic> 21 sessions), to produce benefits of a similar magnitude to teachers&#x02019; classroom practices. Teacher attendance and satisfaction was high with both the minimally adapted and significantly adapted version indicating that participant engagement was not the determining factor. The adaptations were aimed at promoting teacher understanding, confidence and ability to use the strategies in various situations across the school day and ensuring the skills and strategies were introduced in an ecologically valid way (i.e. in a way that was feasible in the Jamaican preschool context). This increased the likelihood that teachers could successfully implement the strategies in the classroom without extensive in-class support and is important for implementation costs if the programme is to be widely disseminated. Other factors that need to be considered in transporting evidence-based interventions are the costs associated with the programme (both the upfront cost involved in purchasing the materials and any ongoing training costs) and its acceptability to policymakers and these factors are key for local adoption of the programme by the Ministry of Education and for ongoing sustainability.</p><p>It should be noted that caution needs to be exercised in comparing the results from this study to the results from the pilot study. The trials differed in several ways including different sampling criteria (the pilot study included two larger better resourced schools and three more typical schools), different lengths of observations (observations were conducted in the morning session only in the pilot study and for the whole day in the current study) and in the pilot study the teacher-training programme was supplemented with a structured curriculum unit on social&#x02013;emotional skills.</p><p>The study has several strengths. The trial had high response rates and attrition was low. The randomisation led to balanced groups at baseline with no significant differences between the groups on any variable. All measurements involved independent observations which are less open to bias than teacher reports of their own behaviour, and observations were conducted by research assistants who were blind to the study design, hypothesis and group allocation. Furthermore, the trial included a 6-month follow-up showing that benefits were sustained after the end of the teacher-training period. There are also several limitations. Teachers were aware of their intervention status and it is possible that they behaved differently during observation. However, there is evidence that conducting observations over the whole day increases the reliability of data and minimises reactivity to being observed (Stoolmiller <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). In addition, community preschools in Jamaica have poor physical conditions including overcrowding, high noise levels, high child&#x02013;teacher ratios and usually have several classrooms in a shared space and in this context, the observer is unobtrusive. Contamination between groups was minimised through the use of a cluster design; however, it is possible that some sharing occurred as schools were situated in a common geographical area, and over 20% of teachers in both groups were enrolled in teacher-training colleges; however, this would reduce the differences between the groups. The generalisability of the results may be limited by the fact that we excluded schools with fewer than 20 children per class and schools with fewer than three and more than four classrooms. However, as the intervention is delivered to all teachers within the school, we anticipate that teachers in smaller and larger schools would also benefit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found large, significant benefits to teachers&#x02019; behaviour and class-wide child behaviour from an intervention providing teachers with training in classroom behaviour management and in how to promote children's social&#x02013;emotional competence. These benefits were assessed by independent, masked observers and sustained at 6-month follow-up. The intervention also led to significant benefits to the behaviour of children at high risk for developing conduct problems at home and at school (see Baker-Henningham <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, we report that making substantial adaptations to an evidence-based programme to ensure contextual fit reduced the amount of individual support teachers need in order to use the skills effectively. We used the IY teacher-training programme and the content was relevant and appropriate to the Jamaican context and we believe that the majority of the strategies introduced through the programme are applicable across different cultures and contexts. However, we also found that adaptations to the materials and methods used improved the cultural and contextual fit and we tentatively conclude that although the strategies are generally relevant and applicable, how they are operationalised in practice is likely to differ across different cultures, contexts and situations. The intervention was implemented through the existing educational services and involved training existing staff and hence should be feasible and sustainable at scale. Training teachers has the advantage that multiple high-risk children can be helped and teachers can continue benefiting new cohorts of children over time. The findings have important implications for child mental health in low-resource settings and show that teacher-training programmes are an important component of initiatives to prevent violence against children, promote child well-being and prevent child mental health problems in LMIC.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by The Wellcome Trust (grant numbers 080534/Z/06/Z and 094307/Z/10/Z).
