The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa in a second randomization of the intense dose-dense arm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>One thousand two hundred eighty-four patients were enrolled; 658 patients were randomly assigned to the IDD-ETC treatment group. Within the IDD-ETC group, 324 patients were further randomly assigned to the epoetin alfa group, and 319 were randomly assigned to the non&#x02013;erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) control group. Primary efficacy endpoints included change in hemoglobin level from baseline to Cycle 9 and the percentage of subjects requiring red blood cell transfusion. Relapse-free survival, overall survival, and intramammary relapse were secondary endpoints estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. Except for the primary hypothesis, all statistical tests were two-sided.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Epoetin alfa avoided the decrease in hemoglobin level (no decrease in the epoetin alfa group vs &#x02013;2.20g/dL change for the control group; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and statistically significantly reduced the percentage of subjects requiring red blood cell transfusion (12.8% vs 28.1%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). The incidence of thrombotic events was 7% in the epoetin alfa arm vs 3% in the control arm. After a median follow-up of 62 months, epoetin alfa treatment did not affect overall survival, relapse-free survival, or intramammary relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Epoetin alfa resulted in improved hemoglobin levels and decreased transfusions without an impact on relapse-free or overall survival. However, epoetin alfa had an adverse effect, resulting in increased thrombosis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Anemia is frequent in cancer patients, especially in those receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy and has a negative impact on the patient&#x02032;s quality of life.</p><p content-type="indent">Established adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens of breast cancer patients lead to a clinically significant degree of anemia. Even a standard anthracycline-containing regimen such as the French FEC regimen (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) induces anemia grades 1 to 3 in 42.4% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). Dose-dense combination regimens with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>) require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in 13% of the patients and intense dose-dense regimens such as intense dose-dense (IDD) sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin (E), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) (IDD-ETC) or doxorubicin (A), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) (IDD-ATC) require RBC transfusions in 25% to 67% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) epoetin alfa had shown efficacy in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5&#x02013;9</xref>) and prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>) of chemotherapy-induced anemia in breast cancer patients. However, individual studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>) and meta-analyses reported an increased risk of death and serious adverse events. Whereas three meta-analyses have indicated an increased risk of mortality with the use of ESAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13&#x02013;15</xref>), two other meta-analyses did not indicate that ESA use statistically significantly affected disease progression or mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>). In addition, there is strong evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials that therapy with epoetin and darbepoetin increases the risk of thromboembolic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">As a consequence, the revised US Food and Drug Administration label states that ESAs should only be used to treat chemotherapy-induced anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>) and they should not be used in malignancies such as early-stage breast cancer when the anticipated treatment outcome is cure.</p><p content-type="indent">In contrast with these recommendations, which were not defined at the start of our trial, we evaluated epoetin alfa for prevention of chemotherapy-induced anemia in a curative indication. In a preceding phase I/II dose-escalation study with 102 patients, 26% of these patients required RBC transfusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). This high percentage of RBC transfusion is not acceptable in the adjuvant setting and was the rationale for performing a second randomization of epoetin alfa vs control in the intense dose-dense ETC arm only. Comparing the effectiveness of IDD-ETC and conventionally scheduled epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel, the 5-year event free survival rates (70% vs 62%) and overall survival rates (82% vs 77%) were statistically significantly improved by IDD-ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">We report data from the second randomization of epoetin alfa vs control in the IDD-ETC arm. Results of our study will contribute to the still ongoing discussion about the benefit and safety of ESAs in the treatment of cancer patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objectives were to determine the effect of epoetin alfa treatment compared with non-ESA control for patients in the IDD-ETC group with regard to hemoglobin (Hb) levels during chemotherapy and RBC transfusion requirements.</p><p content-type="indent">Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of epoetin alfa treatment with regard to the following: overall and recurrence-free survival after 5 years, intramammary relapse, and assessment of health-related patient-reported outcomes and safety (thrombotic vascular events, serious adverse events, clinical laboratory tests).</p><p content-type="indent">The ethics committee of the University of Ulm provided approval for the study.

All patients also received 200mg/day oral iron.</p><p content-type="indent">The objective of epoetin alfa treatment was to maintain an appropriate Hb level of 12.5 to 13.0g/dL. Epoetin alfa had to be withdrawn when the Hb level exceeded 14.0g/dL and could be restarted when the Hb level dropped to less than 13.0g/dL. If the Hb level dropped by more than 2.0g/dL within a 4-week period, the dose of epoetin alfa was to be doubled.</p><p content-type="indent">Patients with an Hb level below 9.0g/dL were evaluated for the need of RBC transfusion. The indication for RBC transfusion depended on the symptoms of the patients and was at the discretion of the physician.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Patients were stratified by center, menopausal status (pre- vs postmenopausal), and the number of affected lymph nodes (4&#x02013;9 vs &#x02265;10) at the central fax randomization.

Group assignment in all analyses was based on the randomization result.</p><p content-type="indent">The sample size of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gyn&#x000e4;kologische Onkologie (AGO) trial was mainly driven by the requirements of the main research question on chemotherapy density and its long-term survival-type endpoint. Prospective power calculations revealed that the resulting sample size was sufficient to detect any meaningful difference in Hb levels and proportions needing transfusion. In addition, the planned patient number attained approximately 85% power to detect a 10% difference in the 5-year relapse-free survival rate after a median follow-up of 5 years using a log-rank test.</p><p content-type="indent">The numbers of patients who received at least one on-study RBC transfusion were compared between the two groups using Fisher exact test.

The Breast Cancer Erythropoietin Survival Trial (BEST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>) was one of the first randomized studies that reported an increased mortality in metastatic breast cancer patients receiving epoetin alfa. The first meta-analysis that identified increased mortality by ESA use (HR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.20) was published by Bennett et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). These authors identified eight studies that individually demonstrated increased mortality and/or tumor progression among patients treated with ESAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21&#x02013;27</xref>). However, it should be noted that only two of these trials treated breast cancer patients (metastatic and neoadjuvant); dominant tumor entities were head and neck, cervical, lympho-proliferative, and non&#x02013;small cell lung carcinoma. Bohlius et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>) reported results from the independent patient data meta-analysis for on-study deaths and overall survival and concluded that ESA use increased mortality during the active study period (HR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.30) and worsened overall survival (HR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.12). However, in patients receiving chemotherapy, a statistically significant difference between the ESA and control groups (on-study death HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.24; overall survival HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.97 to 1.11) was not observed. An erratum regarding a correction of the upper limit of the <italic>x</italic>-axis should be noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>). The meta-analysis of Tonelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>) also confirmed that all-cause mortality during treatment was statistically significantly higher in the group receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating therapy than in the control group.</p><p content-type="indent">In contrast, two meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>) could not confirm these safety concerns. The Glaspy et al. meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>) included studies from the 2006 Cochrane meta-analysis, studies published/updated since the 2006 Cochrane report, and unpublished trial data from Amgen and Johnson and Johnson. Their results indicated that ESA use did not statistically significantly affect mortality (HR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.97 to 1.15) or disease progression (26 studies: HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.14).</p><p content-type="indent">Ludwig et al.

Taken together, the results and conclusions of these meta-analyses remain controversial.</p><p content-type="indent">In our analysis of the IDD-ETC arm, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of relapse-free survival showed no difference between the epoetin alfa and the control group.

Further, for the overall survival analysis, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis showed no significant difference between the two arms (<italic>P</italic> = .89), neither indicating a benefit of maintaining Hb levels and reducing transfusion nor showing any hint for a detrimental effect of epoetin application during dose-dense and dose-intensified chemotherapy.</p><p content-type="indent">Our results are in accordance with two large recently reported studies in the adjuvant treatment of lymph node&#x02013;positive breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

ESAs were given in all three arms if Hb was below 11g/dL. A statistically significantly higher incidence of grade 2 anemia was reported for the two dose-dense arms in comparison with TAC. Two thousand one hundred forty-nine of 4894 included patients in this trial received ESAs. With a median follow-up duration of 5.3 years, exploratory analysis revealed no differences regarding disease-free (HR = 1.02) or overall survival (HR = 1.04).</p><p content-type="indent">The fourth randomized trial in the curative setting of breast cancer patients was the neoadjuvant PREPARE trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>). The PREPARE study compared a sequential IDD regimen of epirubicin and paclitaxel (every 2 weeks) followed by conventional cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate vs conventionally scheduled epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel. Again, in both arms, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either darbepoetin alfa or no treatment to prevent anemia and potentially augment the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy. Three-year disease-free survival was 74.3% with darbepoetin vs 80% without (HR = 1.31; <italic>P</italic> = .06), and overall survival was 88% with darbepoetin vs 91.8% without (HR = 1.33; <italic>P</italic> = .14). Although not statistically significant, these results suggest a negative impact on disease progression.</p><p content-type="indent">Although all four trials were conducted with curative intent, they differ in important points. Only the PREPARE trial included patients in the neoadjuvant treatment setting. The ETC trial is the only trial that exclusively recruited patients undergoing an anemia-causing regimen. WSG-ARA plus, PREPARE, and NSABP B-38 included, at least in part, patients receiving non-anemia-causing regimens. Correspondingly, the mean Hb concentration for the epoetin alfa treatment group in the IDD-ETC arm was lower at the end of chemotherapy (12.4g/dL) as compared with patients in the PREPARE study (13.6g/dL).</p><p content-type="indent">In a review of the literature, preclinical data are ambiguous regarding a direct or indirect effect of ESAs on tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>). A study by Bennett et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>) reported that academic researchers without pharmaceutical manufacturer research/funding more often report both direct and indirect effects of ESAs on tumor growth, in contrast with researchers with pharmaceutical funding. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that the risk of potential tumor progression and decreased survival by the use of ESAs could be mainly restricted to the metastatic and neoadjuvant treatment situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>) in which patients have relevant tumor load. In this clinical setting, ESAs may accentuate tumor growth by stimulation of erythropoietin receptors on tumor cells (despite the questions on antibody specificity in epoetin (EPO) receptor measurement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref>).

Bennett et al.

Specific risk factors in addition to the general risk factors for thrombotic events have not been defined in these trials.

Our study did not evaluate treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia as much as prevention of this anemia. With regard to the rapid decline of the Hb level in the non-ESA control group despite a more than twofold higher transfusion rate, primary prophylaxis of anemia is indicated. This is in contrast with guidelines in Canada and the United States and with the pharmaceutical manufacturers product label that indicate these agents should not be used when patients receive chemotherapy with curative intent. Primary prevention is, at least, partially supported by the updated guidelines of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer,<sup>37</sup> which considers ESA use in selected asymptomatic chemotherapy patients to prevent a further decline in Hb level according to individual factors (eg, type/Intensity and duration of chemotherapy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">We have shown a beneficial effect of epoetin alfa in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients receiving IDD chemotherapy without deleterious effects on disease progression or mortality after almost 5 years of follow-up.

In accordance with the literature, we confirmed the known detrimental effects on thrombotic complications. With the exception of this risk, ESAs appear to be safe drugs for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia or the primary prevention of anemia in patients with IDD chemotherapy regimens. Regarding the effects of ESAs, our results were confirmed by a recent clinical trial whose formal primary endpoint was survival. Data from this study also suggest that ESAs have no detrimental effect on disease progression in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by <funding-source>Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Pharmacia, and Johnson &#x00026; Johnson</funding-source>.
