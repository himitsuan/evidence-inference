In the search for a better treatment to DH, the synergistic effect of diode laser and potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>) (a commonly used antihypersensitivity agent) was compared to the sole application of diode laser or KNO<sub>3</sub> on DH patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institution.

One hundred and twenty patients were diagnosed with the problem of DH with at least two hypersensitive teeth.

For Group 1 (5% KNO<sub>3</sub>), the VAS value decreased by 40.3% for the tactile test [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>] whereas the same treatment decreased 34.1% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>] and 42.4% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>] for the air blast and cold-water tests.

Frechoso <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 10% KNO<sub>3</sub> eased the pain by 35.8% whereas 5% KNO<sub>3</sub> by 11.8% after 48 h.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The increased concentration of KNO<sub>3</sub> reduced the pain, but it may have unseen side effects. Hence, the concentration of KNO<sub>3</sub> was kept constant to 5% for the study. In another study, Wara-aswapati <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the combined effect of triclosan (antiplaque and anti-inflammatory's agent), KNO<sub>3</sub> (desensitizing agent), and sodium mono-fluoro-phosphate (anticaries agent).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This 4-week study suggested that the synergistic effect of these chemicals was much efficient in reducing the DH than the individual application. Similarly, the combined application of 2% strontium chloride and 5% potassium chloride had shown 54% reduction in 3 days.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The sole application of 5% KNO<sub>3</sub> reduced pain by ~40.0% in 6 weeks. Since time to ease the patients is the key, 5% KNO<sub>3</sub> alone may not be the best for treating DH.</p><p>Another method extensively applied for the treatment of DH is the use of laser diodes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Liu <italic>et al</italic>. did an extensive study to determine safety parameters for the diode laser irradiating dentin with three different energy levels of 980 nm diode laser (166, 250, and 333 J/cm<sup>2</sup>).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] They concluded that 2.0 W/CW (166 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) was the best setting for 980 nm diode laser, which effectively sealed the dentin without any morphological damage to the pulp tissue and odontoblasts. Since 166 J/cm<sup>2</sup> was the starting energy level, the uncertainty of effectiveness of this energy was high over the different geographically location.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hence, in this study, the energy level of diode laser was reduced by almost 2.5 times (62.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> with 980 nm) making the laser application much safer. The laser diode was applied for 60 s-in-line with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A meta-analysis study was summarized about the type of lasers found effective for treating DH.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The analysis indicated that erbium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet, neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG), and gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaAlAs) garnet were efficacious in reducing DH. However, the high degree of heterogeneity required more clinical trials. In our study, GaAlA laser was used, which confirms the effectiveness of GaAlAs laser analysis done by Bader <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Kumar and Mehta observed that 5% sodium fluoride combined with (Nd:YAG) laser diode application was considerably efficient in the treatment of DH than sole respective applications.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Similarly, Pesevska <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that the low-energy biostimulation laser application was proficient than traditional topical fluoride treatment.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In another study, Umberto <italic>et al</italic>. reported the efficacy of the laser diode was best when applied while using 5% sodium fluoride for DH treatment.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In line with literature, the synergistic application was more effective than the individual application of KNO<sub>3</sub> or GaAlA laser diode. The laser might induce a slight melting of the dentin surface and rapidly seal the exposed dentin tubules whereas the KNO<sub>3</sub> gel emphasized the reduction in the pain. The speculations on the synergistic mechanism are based on the literature survey and require future directions. Indeed, the synergistic mechanism study must stand out a complete area of research.</p><p>The present study is geographically limited to a particular region. The results presented in this study may vary with the locations; however, the conclusion drawn from this study and during the literature review are accounting for a generic advantage of the synergistic application of diode laser and chemical sealants/additives for the long-term treatment of DH. Nonetheless, the mechanism is relatively unknown. Therefore, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using either scanning electron microscopy or histological analysis may provide an in-depth knowledge on the synergism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The goal was to provide significant and immediate reduced discomfort to DH patients.
