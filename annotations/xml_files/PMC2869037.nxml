The study had a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, with each of the two treatment periods lasting no more than 3&#x000a0;months. At the end of the study, patients were asked to assign preference to one of the treatments (primary endpoint). The number of pain-free (PF) and pain-relief (PR) episodes at 2&#x000a0;h, and number of recurrent and sustained pain-free (SPF) episodes within 48&#x000a0;h were the secondary study endpoints. Seventy-seven percent of patients expressed a preference. Average score of preference was 2.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3 (F) versus 3.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3 (Z; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;NS). Rate of PF episodes at 2&#x000a0;h was 26% with F and 31% with Z (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;NS). PR episodes at 2&#x000a0;h were 57% for F and 58% for Z (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;NS). Rate of recurrence was 21 (F) and 24% (Z; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;NS). Time to recurrence within 48&#x000a0;h was better for F especially between 4 and 16&#x000a0;h (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). SPF episodes were 18 (F) versus 22% (Z; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;NS). Drug-related adverse events were significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) less under F (3 vs. 10). In conclusion, our study suggests that F has a similar efficacy of Z, with some advantage as regards tolerability and recurrence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Frovatriptan</kwd><kwd>Zolmitriptan</kwd><kwd>Patient preference</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Triptans are generally considered as the most effective acute treatment for migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The therapeutic success of sumatriptan, the parent drug of this class, in the treatment of this neurological condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] has prompted the development of other triptan compounds, trying to optimize efficacy and safety in migraine management.</p><p>Frovatriptan (F) is one of the newest triptans, developed in order to provide a clinical potential for a long duration of action and a low likelihood of side effects and drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, with the exception of one study versus sumatriptan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], there are presently no head-to-head randomized trials comparing efficacy and safety of F with that of other triptans. For this reason, a study was setup to compare efficacy and safety of F versus zolmitriptan (Z), a triptan widely employed as first-line therapy for migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The study has been designed to assess efficacy by analyzing traditional migraine treatment endpoints and also by considering patient&#x02019;s preference to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and design</title><p>Male or female subjects, aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years, with a current history of migraine with or without aura, according to IHS criteria, and with at least one migraine attack per month for 6&#x000a0;months prior to entering the study, were eligible for participation in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac, vascular, liver and renal impairment, or any other severe or disabling medical condition could not be enrolled.

Considering a two-tailed test with a 0.05 significance level and an 80.7% power, the estimated number of patients to be randomized was 120 (including a 25% of drop-outs), 60 for each treatment group.</p><p>The intention-to-treat population (ITT, all patients treating at least one attack in each treatment period and completing the preference questionnaire) was the study primary analysis population, while the per-protocol population was the confirmatory analysis.</p><p>Secondary study endpoints were quantified according to IHS Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (1) pain-free (PF) episodes at 2&#x000a0;h (absence of migraine 2&#x000a0;h after intake of one dose of study drug and without any rescue medication), (2) recurrence (migraine occurring within 48&#x000a0;h after a period without migraine), (3) sustained pain-free (SPF) episodes within 48&#x000a0;h (migraine attack which is PF at 2&#x000a0;h, does not recur and does not require the use of rescue medication or a second study drug dose within 48&#x000a0;h), and (4) pain-relief (PR) episodes at 2&#x000a0;h (defined as a decrease in migraine intensity from severe or moderate to mild or none). Consistency of recurrence, defined as patients having at least two or three recurrences over three attacks, was also assessed.</p><p>Safety analysis was applied to all randomized patients, by calculating the incidence of adverse events and changes in vital signs during the study.</p><p>Preference scores were compared between treatment groups by analysis of variance, while logistic regression analysis was used for testing the difference in the proportion of patients with preference for one of the two drugs.

However, our results are in line with those of previous studies based on Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As far as F is regarded, previous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, showed a lower PR rate at 2&#x000a0;h with F as respect to our study (38&#x02013;40 vs. 57%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The additional finding of our study is that proportion of PF episodes at 2&#x000a0;h was much higher than that observed in previous placebo-controlled studies (26 vs. 9&#x02013;14%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>F showed a similar efficacy and patient&#x02019;s preference, while appeared to be safer than Z, with a significantly lower rate of drug-related adverse events.</p><p>In conclusion, our multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, supports the validity of the patient preference approach for the evaluation of migraine treatment, and suggests that, in spite of a similar efficacy, on the long-term, F may have some advantage on Z in terms of safety.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The present study was supported by Istituto Lusofarmaco
