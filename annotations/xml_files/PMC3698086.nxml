The role of intraluminal pressures in maintaining proper lung expansion has been highlighted by experiments using fetal tracheal ligation or occlusion (TO). Preventing the efflux of fluid out of the lungs, TO increases intraluminal pressures and tissue stretch leading to accelerated lung growth and maturation [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since the first reports in the late 1960&#x02019;s, TO has been used to understand the mechanisms of lung growth induced by mechanotransduction [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as well as to remedy lung hypoplasia with special consideration to congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In animal models of CDH, TO improves airway branching, vascular development, and alveolar formation [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As such, clinical TO has been developed to improve the outcome of human fetuses with severe CDH [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In vitro studies focusing on the connections between lung stretch and induced cellular mechanisms have shown that mechanical forces stimulate mechanoreceptors in pulmonary cells, activate signaling pathways, and modify the transcriptional activity of several genes [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This suggests that TO-mediated mechanotransduction might induce changes in the expression of genes involved in lung development and maturation. Therefore recent attention has been drawn to transcriptional changes occurring in intact and/or hypoplastic lungs after TO in sheep and rodents, including genes encoding for growth factors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], transcription factors [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], cell cycle proteins [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], metabolic enzymes [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], epithelial markers [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], ion channels [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], vasoactive mediators [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The creation of a large gas exchange surface area during the alveolar development is the pivotal step for a successful adaptation to extrauterine life. This process is characterized by formation of septa guided by elastic fibers to produce alveoli, thinning of alveolar walls, and expansion of the capillary network underlining the alveolar epithelium. The molecular mechanisms controlling alveolarization involve various growth factor signalings, transcriptions factors, and ECM components [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In human and experimental CDH, defective alveolarization has been linked to abnormal growth factors signalings, leading to inadequate elastin synthesis and deposition as well as vascular underdevelopment [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the enhancement of alveolar formation is one of the most striking known effects of TO, the transcriptional mechanisms by which TO stimulates alveolarization have not been completely elucidated. Most previous reports have indeed focused on genes encoding for growth factors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with less attention paid to ECM, elastin excepted [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However the effect of TO on the matrix environment might be of particular interest since TO rapidly induces a myofibroblast phenotype during the pre-alveolar stage of lung development [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The surgically induced CDH model in the fetal rabbit directly impacts on physical factors exerting on the developing lung by compression of the ipsilateral lung and interference with fetal breathing movements, suppressing therefore cyclic fluctuation of intratracheal pressure during fetal life. This model recapitulates most histological, functional and biological features of human CDH lungs [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further, it is of particular interest to study alveolar formation since unlike sheep [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and rodents [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] the rabbit shares close similarities with the human alveolar development [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This model has been formerly used to determine the effects of TO at morphological [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and functional levels [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with much less emphasis on molecular events.</p><p>The main objective of the present work was to assess the consequences of TO on alveolarization in the rabbit model for CDH, based on histological evaluation and gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We focused on alveolarization-relevant genes related to the ECM, such as genes encoding for matrix components (including those controlling synthesis, assembly, and stability of elastic fibers), regulating interactions between cells and their extracellular environment, or participating in the remodeling of alveolar walls. We hypothesized that the transcription of those genes might be affected by changes in mechanical forces in case of pulmonary hypoplasia and/or overdistension by TO. Transcriptional variations were also confronted with protein expression changes assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In addition we addressed methodological questions related to the use of the rabbit model in the present work and for future studies. As an important pre-requisite for gene expression analysis, the most appropriate combination of housekeeping genes (HKGs) for normalization of qPCR data was determined in the rabbit fetus under various experimental set-ups of interest, including sham operation, surgically induced CDH, TO, and mechanical ventilation. Finally, the most reliable control group was identified by comparisons between non-operated and sham-operated fetuses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Animals and ethics Statement</title><p>Forty-three rabbit fetuses were obtained from 2 ongoing sets of experiments aiming at evaluating lung biology after TO in the surgically induced CDH model. Thirty-seven pregnant New Zealand White female rabbits obtained at 15 days&#x02019; gestational age (GA) were housed as previously reported [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The offspring of the first set of 19 does (obtained from CEGAV, France) was euthanatized just before delivery to investigate biological changes before adaptation to extrauterine life occurs. The offspring of the second set of 18 does (obtained from Charles River, Germany) was mechanically ventilated before the lung tissue was processed for further investigation. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the &#x0201c;Universit&#x000e9; Libre de Bruxelles&#x0201d; (Brussels, Belgium, number 321N) and the Bavarian Animal Research Authority (Munich, Germany, number 55.2-1-54-2531-149-08). All experiments were carried out in agreement with the guidelines of laboratory animals&#x02019; care and use of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Experimental protocols and tissue collection</title><p>Anesthesia and surgical procedures have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Fetuses located at the ovarian end of each uterine horn were selected, since they do not exhibit fetal growth retardation as compared to fetuses situated near the vaginal end [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The experimental protocol was based on a 2x2 factorial design. Fetuses were assigned to each type of surgery (neither intervention, one or the other, or both) using a computer-generated random allocation sequence and a block randomization ensuring similar number of subjects in each group (http:/www.randomization.com/). Briefly, at 23 days&#x02019; GA (pseudoglandular stage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069210-g001">Figure 1)</xref>, 2 fetuses per doe were assigned to a partial excision of the diaphragm through a left thoracotomy (DH) or a thoracotomy without diaphragmatic incision (sham DH). Five days later (late canalicular stage), the previously operated fetuses were subjected to a tracheal ligation (TO) or a tissue dissection (sham TO). Based on this protocol four study groups were defined: SHAM (sham DH/sham TO), TO (sham DH/TO), DH (DH/sham TO), and DH+ TO (DH/TO). Non-operated fetuses were added for comparisons with SHAM fetuses. At term (31 days&#x02019; GA), living operated fetuses and non-operated controls were delivered by cesarean section. Maternal anesthesia and parameters were closely monitored during fetal harvesting. After cesarean section each doe was killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. In the first set of experiments, fetuses were euthanatized during cesarean section with an overdose of anesthetics to avoid pulmonary changes occurring at and after birth. In the second set of experiments, fetuses were delivered, anesthetized, and ventilated during 30 minutes to assess lung mechanics before euthanasia [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Ventilation was maintained with 21% O2 with physiological breathing rate (120 breaths/minute), low tidal volume (8 ml/kg), and low positive end-expiratory pressure (3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), conditions that would unlikely alter profoundly the pulmonary parenchyma or induce severe inflammatory processes [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ventilation data and repeated lung function measurements are not reported in this work, as the sample size needed to evidence significant differences between groups in terms of lung mechanics (<italic>n</italic> = 8 to 10) has not been reached yet at the time of the completion of the current study. Fetal lungs were harvested and weighed for the calculation of the lung to body weight ratio (LBWR). The left lung was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until RNA and protein extraction. The right lower lobe was kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for future biological studies. The right upper lobe of previous ventilated fetuses was fixed in a device filled with paraformaldehyde and subjected overnight to a low vacuum in order to avoid tissue collapse [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the absence of previous qPCR data in the fetal rabbit lung undergoing TO, sample size was estimated by the sample maximization strategy for qPCR experiments [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] taking into account previous qPCR reports [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Laboratory experiments were thus started as soon as 4 to 5 fetuses per group were obtained. All samples (<italic>n</italic> = 43) were included in a pilot analysis for the selection of optimal HKGs under various conditions. Lungs from ventilated fetuses (<italic>n</italic> = 22) were used to study the effects of TO on alveolarization at transcriptional, translational, and histological level.</p><fig id="pone-0069210-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0069210.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design in the rabbit fetus.</title><p>Fetal rabbits underwent two successive randomized surgeries during the late pulmonary development (at 23 and 28 days&#x02019; gestational age).

The sections were washed and successively treated with Celestin Blue, hematoxylin, and Curtis&#x02019; stain before dehydration and mounting. Sections were analyzed using a light microscope connected to a digital camera (CarlZeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Eight random non-overlapping fields per lung were captured in color at a magnification of x40. For each lung the whole pulmonary section was considered so that any lung heterogeneity could be taken into account in the final calculations. Two blinded observers (AV and XR) used the point-counting method to measure elastin deposits at the tips of secondary crests, elastin fibers within the alveolar walls, and the percentage of lung occupied by tissue. The number of times the point grid fell on elastin-containing crests was expressed as a percentage of tissue area. The number of times a dark elastic fiber fell on the grid was related to the number of times alveolar walls fell on the grid.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription</title><p>Total RNA from whole frozen lungs (100 mg) was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Ghent, Belgium) as previously described [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Procedure and amplification protocols have been previously reported [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For a given gene, all samples were analyzed in the same qPCR run according to the sample maximization strategy to minimize technical variations and ensure reliable estimation of gene expression levels [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For the analysis of HKG expression stability, the 43 lung samples were therefore measured in duplicates, whereas the analysis of target gene expressions was performed in 22 ventilated lung samples measured in triplicates. At the end of each run, the software used the recorded fluorescence measurements to calculate the quantification cycle (Cq) value for each well, which was defined by the number of PCR cycles at which fluorescence increases significantly above the background. To ensure the quality of measurements, negative (no template) and positive controls were included. In no template controls, amplification was not detected or Cq values were above 36. Intra-assay variation expressed as standard deviation of the Cq variance was between 0.03 and 0.09.</p></sec><sec id="s2.7"><title>Determination of housekeeping gene expression stability</title><p>Raw Cq data for the ten candidate HKGs were analyzed with the <italic>genorm</italic> software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogazelle.com">http://www.biogazelle.com/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Firstly <italic>genorm</italic> established the expression stability of the candidate HKGs, which is defined as the constancy of the level of expression of a particular housekeeping gene in a given cell type, organ or experiment. The most stable gene identified by <italic>genorm</italic> among the other candidate genes exhibits therefore a level of expression that is less affected by experimental conditions than the other genes. For each experimental set-up, candidate HKGs were ranked based on the calculation of a gene expression stability parameter (M), which is the mean pair-wise variation for a gene from all other tested genes [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. At each step, the gene with the highest M value (i.e. the less stable gene) was excluded for next analysis and the M values were recalculated until the most stable gene remained. An M value below 0.5 indicated a stably expressed gene. Besides M values, the software secondly provided additional data by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) of the normalized gene relative quantities. A CV value below 0.2 was considered as acceptable [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The optimal number of HKGs was secondly determined by V analysis comparing the magnitude of the change in the normalization factor (NFn) after the inclusion of an additional HKG (NFn+1). The Vn/n+1 cut-off value of 0.15 indicated a set of stably expressed HKGs [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2.8"><title>Analysis and normalization of gene expression data</title><p>Because Cq values are logarithmic, they underestimate the true degree of variation that would be obvious in case of linear conversion. For each HKG and target gene, averaged Cq values obtained for each sample were therefore converted to linear values (Q) according to the efficiency corrected model [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]: Q = E<sup>&#x00394;Cq</sup>, where E is the efficiency of PCR reaction and &#x00394;Cq is the difference between the averaged Cq value of a sample and that of the sample with the highest expression (minimum Cq value) in the data set. To obtain normalized gene expression values, linear values were then divided by a normalization factor that was the geometric mean of the linear values calculated for the combination of the most stable HKGs identified by <italic>genorm</italic> [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Normalized expression levels obtained for each HKG were compared to evaluate the impact of mechanical ventilation and surgical procedures (sham operation, diaphragmatic excision, and tracheal ligation).

After rinsing in TBS and incubation with a diaminobenzidine solution (Dako), sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded isopropanol, cleared in toluene, and mounted with DPX media (VWR, Leuven, Belgium). Color pictures were captured at a magnification of x40 using a light microscope connected to a digital camera (CarlZeiss).

Protein concentration was then measured by BCA colorimetric assay following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Perbio, Erembodegem, Belgium). Equal amounts of total proteins (40 &#x000b5;g per lane) were reduced with LDS sample buffer containing 50 mM DTT following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Life Technologies), boiled for 10 min, separated on 4&#x02013;12% bis-tris polyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies) using MES SDS running buffer (Life Technologies), and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 &#x000b5;m pore size, Bio-Rad Laboratories) by semi-dry electroblotting. Staining the membranes with 0.3% Ponceau S assessed successful transfer of proteins and molecular weight marker. After blocking with 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBS/0.1% Tween (TBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature, membranes were incubated with the aforementioned anti-MMP2, anti-MMP14, anti-TIMP1 or anti-TIMP2 antibodies that were diluted in blocking buffer (1:1000, 1:100, 1:100, and 1:100 respectively). After overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG antibody (#31430 and #31400, Perbio; 1:50,000). Antigen&#x02013;antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (Perbio), before exposure to X-ray film. Membranes were stripped (Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer, Perbio), and reprobed with mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (G8795, Sigma-Aldrich, Diegem, Belgium; 1:5000) as an internal loading control remaining stable under the current experimental conditions.

A co-localization of MMP2, MMP14 and TIMP2 was expected in the peripheral parenchyma, as the activation of MMP2 requires MMP14 and TIMP2. Indeed MMP2, MMP14, and TIMP2 were diffusely co-expressed in alveolar epithelial cells of non-operated, SHAM, DH+ TO, and TO lungs. In DH lungs, their immunoreactivity was also observed in mesenchymal cells of thickened septa. Only TIMP1 showed a different pattern of distribution after TO. In non-operated and SHAM lungs, TIMP1 immunoreactivity was found in basement membranes underlying the alveolar epithelium, endothelial cells of alveolar capillaries, and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm of some alveolar epithelial cells. In hypoplastic lungs the immunoreactivity pattern of TIMP1 in endothelial and epithelial cells was comparable to that of non-operated and SHAM lungs, without detection in the interstitium of thickened alveolar septa. Strikingly alveolar walls of TO-exposed lungs exhibited a much more diffuse immune reaction for TIMP1 as compared to non-operated and SHAM lungs. Finally, the immunolocalization of MMP2, MMP14, TIMP1 and TIMP2 was similar in lung airways and vasculature in all study groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069210.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0069210-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0069210.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Localization of MMPs and TIMPs in alveolar septa in the fetal rabbit model for CDH undergoing TO.</title><p>Representative images of immunohistochemistry for MMP2 (<bold>A</bold>&#x02013;<bold>E</bold>), MMP14 (<bold>F</bold>&#x02013;<bold>J</bold>), TIMP1 (<bold>K</bold>&#x02013;<bold>O</bold>), and TIMP2 (<bold>P</bold>&#x02013;<bold>T</bold>) in non-operated (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>F</bold>, <bold>Q</bold>, <bold>P</bold>), SHAM (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>G</bold>, <bold>L</bold>, <bold>K</bold>), DH (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>H</bold>, <bold>M</bold>, <bold>R</bold>), DH+ TO (<bold>D</bold>, <bold>I</bold>, <bold>N</bold>, <bold>S</bold>), and TO lungs (<bold>E</bold>, <bold>J</bold>, <bold>O</bold>, <bold>T</bold>).

In the fetal rabbit model for CDH, TO stimulated the alveolar formation, notably through an increased number of secondary crests in both intact and hypoplastic lungs together with increased transcription of several genes related to the ECM. Those genes were involved in the normal process of alveolarization, including molecules expressed in the growing secondary septa or involved in interactions between cells and extracellular environment. While TO increased the expression of genes that were downregulated in DH rabbit lungs, TO also induced changes in the expression of other genes that were not affected in lung hypoplasia. Most of the transcriptional effects observed might be beneficial for alveolar formation. However, the meaning of higher levels for TIMP1 has to be further explored, as these changes might be detrimental for postnatal alveolar development.</p><p>The transcription of pulmonary genes in the present study was evaluated by qPCR as a more sensitive, reliable, and accurate tool than previously used techniques, like hybridization methods [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and conventional end-point PCR followed by gel electrophoresis [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Accurate interpretation of qPCR results requires an appropriate methodology to minimize technical variations and highlight true biological variations between experimental groups. Each step of qPCR should therefore be controlled with careful care for sample preparation, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, primer design, assay validation, and normalization strategy [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The current gold standard for normalization is the use of stable HKGs as internal controls. Since a perfect and universal HKG does not exist, normalization by the geometric average of multiple and validated HKGs has been strongly recommended [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. MIQE guidelines notwithstanding, most recent studies focusing on mRNA expression after CDH and/or TO in rodents or sheep reported normalization against a single HKG, like 18S rRNA [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], ACTB [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or GAPDH [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The present study confirmed that the use of inadequate HKGs or inappropriate number of HKGs might considerably affect statistical significances. Despite apparent low HKG expression variability obtained after <italic>genorm</italic> analysis, mechanical stretch induced by TO or mechanical ventilation changed the transcription of some candidate HKGs. ACTB, which has been identified as an unstable HKG for human lung epithelial cells and whole lungs exposed to cyclic mechanical strain [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], was upregulated after mechanical ventilation and TO. Mechanical stretch also affected transcripts involved in energy production pathways like GAPDH and ATP5B. The metabolic effects of TO have already been suggested in intact murine lungs in which six of the key glycolytic enzyme genes were upregulated as early as one hour after TO [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover mechanical ventilation increased B2M levels, which have been related to chronic lung disease in ventilated premature infants [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These results collectively indicate that special caution should be paid to the selection and validation of HKGs for qPCR studies in general, and in particular for those focusing on TO-mediated mechanotransduction. Besides the use of validated HKGs as a methodological requisite for qPCR, the identification of changes in HKG expression might also be helpful to highlight modifications of basic cellular mechanisms under specific physiopathological conditions [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], even if those cellular pathways were presumably constitutively expressed.</p><p>Besides the selection and validation of HKGs, the choice of an appropriate control group is also crucial for interpretation of results and may be the source of discrepancies in the reported literature. In the nitrofen model in fetal rats, fetuses having received olive oil were more often chosen as controls [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] than those exposed to nitrofen and free of diaphragmatic hernia. In the surgical model in fetal sheep, control fetuses were non-operated [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or sham-operated fetuses [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the surgical model in fetal rabbits, non-operated fetuses were considered as suitable controls [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], because non-operated and sham-operated fetuses shared similar fetal growth and pulmonary morphology [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However recent studies showed altered lung mechanics in sham DH rabbit fetuses [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and lower LBWR in sham TO rat fetuses [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], raising the question of the suitability of non-operated fetuses as controls for surgical models of CDH and TO. In the present work, SHAM fetuses (i.e. undergoing two consecutive sham operations) were a priori considered as the most suitable controls for comparisons with other surgical groups because of pain, stress, thoracic scar, and possible oligoamnios induced by sham surgery. SHAM fetuses showed neither real pulmonary hypoplasia nor significant changes in elastin deposition, but sensitive qPCR could detect differences for TNC, TIMP2, and MMP2/TIMP1 ratio. Apart from pain and stress, sham surgery might also induce inflammation since increased TNC mRNA levels and imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs have been linked to inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The importance of the choice of an appropriate control group may be illustrated by discordances regarding TNC expression between the present study and a previous work in which our team compared DH rabbit lungs (without sham TO) to non-operated fetuses [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Actually this contradiction may be simply explained by significant differences in TNC expression between non-operated and SHAM lungs. Taking these results into account, non-operated fetuses should not be considered anymore as an appropriate control group for studies in the surgical rabbit for CDH undergoing TO.</p><p>The present study suggests that variable increase in mRNA levels for ELN, LOX, FBLN5, DBN1, TNC and ITGA6 could lead to variable increase in pulmonary growth, indicating that lung growth induced by TO is closely related to the expression of specific alveolarization-relevant genes. Essential for secondary septation and alveolarization, elastogenesis occurs in septal myofibroblasts and results from highly regulated steps with coordinated gene expressions, which involve synthesis of the monomeric protein, cross-linking into insoluble protein, and aggregation with microfibrils [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In agreement with previous reports in ovine and murine models [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], TO increased ELN transcripts and improved the pulmonary deposition of elastin fibers in the fetal rabbit model. In addition to these confirmatory findings our new results suggest that TO might contribute to form the complete functional elastic fiber under pretranslational actions on LOX and FBLN5, both genes that were downregulated in the CDH rabbit lungs [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Besides elastin, myofibroblasts also produce TNC, an ECM glycoprotein that accumulates at sites of branching during lung morphogenesis and strictly collocates with elastin at the apex of secondary crests [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Knockout models have already shown the role of TNC in lung morphogenesis [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition TNC has been considered as a factor transducing mechanical forces and controlling cell migration during early lung development [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The CDH model in the fetal rabbit showed decreased pulmonary transcripts for TNC in concordance with previous data in the nitrofen model [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The restoration of TNC levels after TO and experimental data in neonatal chronic lung disease [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] support the role of TNC in alveolarization and transduction of mechanical stimuli. Apart from molecules secreted in the ECM, integrins are a wide family of transmembrane heterodimeric glycoproteins that link the cytosqueleton to the extracellular environment and act as adhesion receptors, signaling receptors, and mechanoreceptors to control cell growth, migration, and differentiation [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent descriptive studies on lung ontogeny have supported the role of integrin subunits ITGA6 and ITGB1 in the alveolarization process [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. On the one hand, mice deficient for ITGA6 develop severe lung hypoplasia [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the other hand, ITGB1 is highly expressed in alveolar myofibroblasts and bind FBLN5 and microfibrils during the extracellular step of elastic fiber assembly, a process occurring in close association with the cell surface [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The present work also suggests the involvement of ITGA6 deficiency in CDH, as TO restored ITGA6 mRNA levels concomitantly with the correction of lung hypoplasia. Moreover increased transcripts for ITGB1 after experimental TO fell in line with the overexpression of elastogenesis-related genes induced by a sustained mechanical stretch. Interestingly ITGB1 transcripts were strongly associated with MMPS and TIMPs transcripts unlike the other alveolarization genes. Previous reports have reported functional links between integrins and the MMP/TIMP system [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance ITGB1 may complex to MMPs and TIMPs, establishing a link between pericellular matrix remodeling and cytoskeletal reorganization to promote cell migration [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The regulation of MMP2 and TIMP1 transcription by other integrins has also been proposed [<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], but the exact meaning of the relationships between ITGB1 and TIMPs remains to be determined in the settings of CDH and TO. Besides integrins the reorganization of the actin-cytoskeleton may be regulated by DBN1, an actin-binding protein transiently expressed by myofibroblasts at the tips of secondary septa like ELN and TNC [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It has been suggested that DBN1 regulates the organization of actin filaments in septal myofibroblasts, leading to the formation of cellular protrusions and finally the elongation of the secondary septum [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Increased DBN1 transcripts after experimental TO reinforce the idea that DBN1 participates in alveolarization.</p><p>Sparse and controversial data based on experimental models have involved the MMP/TIMP system in the defective alveolar and vascular development of CDH lungs [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In the rabbit model lung hypoplasia did not come along with changes in MMPs or TIMPs transcription. These results together with immunohistochemical data were not in favor of a ruptured MMP/TIMP balance. However physical forces may regulate the transcription of MMPs and TIMPs [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With regards to previous reports different types of mechanical stretch did not modify gene expression in the same manner [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed intermittent cyclical mechanical strain imitating fetal breathing movements did not change the transcriptional levels of most MMPs or TIMPs [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], while mechanical stretch imitating injury induced MMP2, MMP14, and TIMP1 transcripts [<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. A sustained mechanical stretch after TO in the fetal rabbit model did not change mRNA or protein levels for MMPs nor their cellular localization. Surprisingly TO induced TIMP1 transcripts in whole lung tissue and increased TIMP1 immunoreactivity in alveolar septa. This seems to contradict the idea that TO might be beneficial for the remodeling of newly formed alveoli, as suggested by the well-established relationship between increased TIMP1 levels and deposition of ECM components in fibrotic pulmonary diseases [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Moreover potential detrimental effects of TO have been reported in the fetal lamb model for CDH, in which hypoplastic lungs treated by either sustained or temporary TO still display persistent increase in alveolar wall thickness as compared to sham-operated lungs [<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Nevertheless a transient increase in TIMP1 mRNA levels during septation might prevent from excessive degradation of newly formed elastin [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Besides the inhibition of MMPs activity, TIMP1 may also induce proliferation and reduce apoptosis in different cell lines through pathways that are independent of MMP inhibition [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Hence overexpression of TIMP1 might be coherent with enhanced tissue proliferation after TO. These results represent a first step towards a better knowledge of the molecular events initiated by TO. However additional experiments based on enzymatic activities including the study of other MMPs and TIMPs are warranted to precise the role of the MMP/TIMP balance in the settings of CDH and TO.</p><p>We may only hypothesize about the mechanisms by which TO modulated target genes. Changes in gene expressions may occur after direct activation of a mechano-responsive gene promoter region, after activation of membrane receptors and initiation of intracellular pathways, or after liberation of growth factors in the extracellular environment with consequential paracrine or autocrine actions [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is therefore plausible that TO might upregulates genes expression after release of growth factors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], activation of receptors (e.g. integrins), or stimulation of mechano-sensitive ion channels, with subsequent stimulation of target genes by various transcription factors [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The activation of growth factor signalings after TO might explain coordinated expressions of genes that are co-regulated in favor of alveolar formation, as suggested by positive relationships between target genes observed in the present study. For instance alveolar formation requires the fibroblast growth factor-18 (FGF18), which is upregulated by TO [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and induces ELN, LOX and FBLN5 transcripts in fetal lung fibroblasts [<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Thus FGF18 might be a common denominator of functionally related genes encoding ELN, LOX and FBLN5. Additionally other growth factors might be involved in the relationships between matrix-related genes. After induction of a mechanical stress numerous ECM components are indeed targeted by the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;) signaling, including ELN, TNC, TIMPs, and integrins [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since TGF&#x000df;-2 is increased after TO [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], activation of the TGF&#x003b2; signaling could account for coordinated increased mRNA levels for TNC, ELN and ITGA6 or for ITGB1 and TIMPs. The findings of the current study as well as the proposed putative mechanisms of TO-induced alveolar formation have been summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069210-g009">Figure 9</xref>. In this hypothetical synopsis the mechanical stretch induced by TO upregulates ELN transcription together with LOX and FBLN5 in alveolar myofibroblasts for proper coordination of elastin assembly. This process is encouraged by integrins that bind microfibrils to promote mature elastic fiber formation. Besides elastic fibers new primary septa also contains TNC. Further elongation of the primary septum is stimulated by myofibroblast migration through the extracellular environment with the help of integrins, DBN1, and TNC. Additional elevated TIMP1 levels prevent from excessive degradation of newly synthesized elastin and participate to induced cell proliferation after TO. Finally we may speculate that overexpression of factors transducing mechanical forces such as integrins, TNC or DBN1 might create a positive feedback loop to increase cell sensitivity to mechanical strain.</p><fig id="pone-0069210-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0069210.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Synopsis of hypothetical mechanisms by which alveolarization-relevant genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) might be modulated by a sustained mechanical stretch induced by tracheal occlusion.</title><p>Tissue stretch is transmitted to alveolar myofibroblasts directly by mechanoreceptors (integrins) and ion channels or indirectly by liberation of growth factors stored/secreted in the ECM.

Firstly, sample size could have been underestimated in the absence of gene expression studies in the fetal rabbit model undergoing TO. Indeed, additional numbers of subjects would have probably affected the results significantly for a few comparisons with statistical power between 72 and 84% (e.g. for DBN1, ITGB1, and MMP14/TIMP1 ratio). Yet despite the low sample size, significant differences between groups were evidenced with satisfactory statistical power between 97% and 100% for most multiple comparisons. This is probably due to the accuracy of qPCR results obtained with the chosen normalization strategy. Secondly, Western blot analyses failed to detect free forms of TIMPs, active MMP2 or full-length MMP14. This might be due to the lack of sensitivity of the technique as well as possible post-translational modifications of the target proteins occurring during the rabbit lung development. As the present study was not designed to assess the MMP/TIMP balance, there was regrettably not enough material for additional and more sensitive experiments regarding MMP and TIMP activities, such as zymography, reverse zymography or activity assays. Thirdly, the use of predicted rabbit or human nucleic acid sequences could not be avoided for primer design. In spite of greater phylogenetical similarities with humans than rodents, rabbit models have indeed some limitations due the poor knowledge of the rabbit genome and the paucity of commercially available immunologic reagents.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned limitations, our results based on the rabbit model for CDH suggest that the mechanisms by which experimental TO improved alveolar formation were at least in part linked to mechanotransduction-mediated expressions of genes related to the matrix environment. New molecular targets for TO were identified in hypoplastic lungs and their expressions were related to fetal lung growth. Yet the exact meaning of such translational changes remains mainly speculative and confirmational studies are advocated. The present study also provides further evidence that mechanical stretch could influence HKG stability, and proposes a normalization strategy for pulmonary gene expression analysis in the fetal rabbit model for CDH after TO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0069210.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Melting curves of amplified products corresponding to the newly designed primer pairs.</title><p>Graphs show a single peak of a specific product at high temperature (&#x0003e; 80&#x000b0;C) with nothing or very little detected in no-template controls A.

No apparent differences in staining pattern for MMP2, MMP14, TIMP1 and TIMP2 were observed between the study groups. The epithelium of bronchi and bronchioles displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for MMP2, MMP14, and TIMP2 (high-magnification inserts). Moreover the apical membrane of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium was stained for TIMP1 (high-magnification inserts), but an artifactual staining was not excluded for certain. Regarding the lung vasculature MMP2 but not MMP14 was located in the pulmonary arteries with a strong immune reaction in the adventitia (solid arrowheads) and a faint staining of the media (open arrowheads). TIMP2 and TIMP1 were respectively localized in the adventitia (solid arrowheads) and the endothelium (arrows) of pulmonary arteries.
