The present randomised, controlled, crossover study was therefore designed to determine whether patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes who are already using insulin pump therapy can achieve improved metabolic control with the addition of personal CGM, and to evaluate associated changes in insulin treatment patterns while using SAP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="d29e471"><title>Study design</title><p>The study had a multicentre, randomised, controlled, crossover design.</p></sec><sec id="d29e476"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited at four adult and four paediatric sites in Europe with experience in the use of insulin pumps and CGM.

All participants received structured training on diabetes management and device use and had their knowledge assessed, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Each treatment period was 6&#x000a0;months long, with a 4-month washout phase between the two periods. Study visits occurred every 6&#x000a0;weeks during the treatment periods, when the data from all devices were uploaded onto a computer system using diabetes management software (CareLink Therapy Management System for Diabetes-Clinical; Medtronic, Tolochenaz, Switzerland).

Participants were individually encouraged to make self-adjustments to their treatment using real-time CGM values, hyper- and hypoglycaemic alerts and trends, or to incorporate self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results into treatment adjustments, with written examples of therapy changes provided in the optional patient diary. Participants completed a ten-question test to demonstrate technical knowledge on the pump (4&#x000a0;weeks before randomisation) and a 12-question test on CGM (at visit 1 of the On/Off sequence or visit 6 of the Off/On sequence).</p></sec><sec id="d29e512"><title>Outcome measure</title><p>The primary endpoint was the difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels between the Sensor On and Sensor Off arms after 6&#x000a0;months of follow-up, adjusting for baseline levels.

For the Sensor On arm, 100% sensor use was calculated as the number of days in the Sensor On period multiplied by 288, the maximum number of sensor readings per day. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was analysed by a central laboratory at screening, randomisation and at 3, 6, 10, 13 and 16&#x000a0;months using a Diabetes Control and Complication Trial-aligned HPLC method (Laboratorium f&#x000fc;r Klinische Forschung, Kiel, Germany).</p><p>Data on adverse events were collected at each visit and the number of SMBG values &#x0003c;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/l were calculated from the glucose meter downloads for 15&#x000a0;days prior to the end of each period. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance from another person or neurological recovery in response to restoration of plasma glucose to normal. Ketoacidosis events were defined as episodes of hyperglycaemia (blood glucose &#x0003e;13.9&#x000a0;mmol/l) with low serum bicarbonate (&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;mmol/l), low pH (&#x0003c;7.3) or both, together with either ketonaemia or ketonuria, that required treatment in a healthcare facility. Patterns of insulin use (total insulin dose, relative proportions of basal and bolus doses, number of boluses and temporary basal rates, and use of basal suspend and bolus wizard features) during the 15&#x000a0;days prior to the end of each study period were analysed from the data uploaded from the insulin pumps.</p></sec><sec id="d29e527"><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 124 participants (62 randomised to sequence On/Off and 62 randomised to sequence Off/On) provided 90% power to detect a mean difference of 0.3% in the primary endpoint, assuming an SD of 1.0%, a two-tailed matched-pairs <italic>t</italic> test and a type I error of 5%.

Crossover studies of longer duration are seldom used in trials evaluating diabetes-related technology. However, bias resulting from differences in education and patient&#x02013;healthcare provider interactions is largely prevented by this study design. Moreover, in the present study the number of participants lost to follow-up was lower than expected and the washout period prevented any appreciable treatment carry-over.</p><p>Although the studies cannot be directly compared, the significant decreases in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in both age groups in our study are not consistent with the results of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) trial, where no change in metabolic control was demonstrated in children or adolescents using CGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Two other randomised controlled trials directly comparing SAP to CSII alone demonstrated a significant improvement in glycaemic control in both the treatment and control groups, and the observed difference between the study groups did not attain statistical significance in the ITT analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These substantial study effects, together with dissimilarities in dropout rates, may account for the differences between the present study and those in which no significant improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was demonstrated. Two recent meta-analyses of all randomised controlled trials comparing CSII with or without CGM also demonstrated a significant, albeit modest, benefit of CGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with a mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> that was comparable to that found in the present study. However, unlike the findings in the meta-analyses, we did not observe any relationship between baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction.</p><p>Studies consistently show that sufficient sensor use is crucial to the success of CGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the present study, 72% of participants wore a sensor for more than 70% of the required time, which is similar to that observed in the adult cohort, but greater than that in the paediatric cohort, in the JDRF study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and similar to that observed in Sensor-augmented pump Therapy for A<sub>1c</sub> Reduction (STAR)3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The latter study demonstrated that an increase in the frequency of sensor use from 41% to 80% was associated with a doubling of the HbA<sub>1c</sub>-lowering effect. Moreover, in the On/Off sequence there was a loss of effect following the removal of CGM during the washout period and Sensor Off arm, whereas no change in the HbA<sub>1c</sub> was observed during the washout period in the Off/On sequence. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the efficacy of CGM depends upon its continuous use.</p><p>The HbA<sub>1c</sub> decrease in this study was accompanied by improvements in several secondary endpoints, including increased time spent in normoglycaemia, decreased time in hyperglycaemia and reduced time in hypoglycaemia. A decrease in time spent in hypoglycaemia in patients with well-controlled diabetes with substantially lower mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, this is the first report of a concomitant decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and time spent in hypoglycaemia in participants with less well controlled diabetes using CGM.</p><p>As participants did not receive specific written instructions on how to use the data from CGM, it was of interest to investigate modifications of treatment patterns during the Sensor On period. More frequent insulin bolus administration along with more frequent use of temporary basal rates and manual basal suspend function could contribute to lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and reducing the time spent in hypoglycaemia. Indeed, in a large observational study with 1,041 patients on insulin pumps, lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> was associated with more frequent insulin bolus administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. With CGM, the participants also used the bolus wizard calculator feature more often. Hence, considered together, our data indicate that SAP is associated with more active self-adjustments of the insulin therapy.</p><p>The frequency of SMBG values &#x0003c;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/l was not statistically different between the Sensor On and Sensor Off arms; however, significantly fewer SMBGs were performed during the Sensor On arm. The rate of severe hypoglycaemia was very low and did not significantly differ between the Sensor On and Sensor Off arms, however, this study excluded participants with a known history of severe hypoglycaemia. Similarly, the rates of severe hypoglycaemia were low in the JDRF and STAR3 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and did not differ between study groups. None of these trials was powered to detect differences in severe hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Potential limitations apply to this study, which may affect the generalisability of our findings. The small study effect observed during the run-in period could have persisted into the treatment periods. No common protocol was used for adjusting the therapy based on CGM or SMBG during the study, which could have lessened the effect of sensor use. However, a recent study did not show a metabolic benefit of a physician-led structured use of CGM over patient-led use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, all participants had pre-existing knowledge of diabetes management. The definition of hypoglycaemia as &#x0003c;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/l was conservative. Finally, the decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the Sensor On arm did not plateau after 6&#x000a0;months, as observed in other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels may have continued to decrease following longer treatment. By its nature, the study precluded blinding. The addition of CGM to established CSII has cost implications, and analyses are being conducted to assess the health economic impact on medical resource utilisation and direct costs.</p><p>In conclusion, in both paediatric and adult participants with type 1 diabetes using CSII therapy alone, the addition of CGM resulted in an improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with a concomitant decrease in time spent in hypoglycaemia. More frequent self-adjustments of insulin therapy with SAP may have contributed to these effects. The removal of CGM resulted in a loss of metabolic benefit.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The SWITCH Study Group includes T. Battelino, I. Conget, B. Olsen, I.
