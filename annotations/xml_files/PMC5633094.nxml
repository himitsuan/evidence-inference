The aims of the study were to assess variations in respiratory and hemodinamic parameters with electronic inspiratory muscle training (EIMT) in tracheostomized patients requiring MV and to compare these variations with those in a group of patients subjected to an intermittent nebulization program (INP).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a pilot, prospective, randomized study of tracheostomized patients requiring MV in one intensive care unit (ICU). Twenty-one patients were randomized: 11 into the INP group and 10 into the EIMT group.

However, the disuse of the respiratory muscles that occurs alongside such controlled ventilation weakens the muscles [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and decreases diaphragm strength in a manner that is logarithmically proportional to the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and to the use of sedation and muscle blockers [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Episodes of sepsis, extended MV, and severe polyneuropathy [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] exacerbate the harmful effects on respiratory muscular function and can lead to long dependence from MV [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The process of weaning from MV involves the patient initially spending approximately 40% of their time on MV [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, especially when the weaning process started late, the significant loss of muscle strength means that between 5% and 15% of patients being weaned repeatedly fail to regain respiratory autonomy [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The extended use of MV is associated with high daily cost of hospitalization and a higher mortality [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; therefore, pulmonary rehabilitation interventions have been decreasing hospitalization time and substantially reducing hospital costs [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Respiratory muscle training reverses weakness and improves endurance [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The training can result in a significant increase in the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as well as successful weaning of patients who have failed repeatedly [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Muscle training is safe, with no adverse hemodynamic or respiratory repercussions that would necessitate discontinuing the procedure, even in patients whose condition is severe [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>New technologies are available for respiratory muscle training. Electronic devices play a key role in increasing the respiratory performance of recreational runners [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The safety of these devices using inspiratory loads of up to 60% MIP has been confirmed in normal individuals. Specifically, when this limit was applied, the resulting hemodynamic variations were within the normal range [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Souza et al [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used an electronic device for inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in a tracheostomized patient on MV who had a neuromuscular disease; the investigators observed an increase in MIP, detected no significant hemodynamic repercussions, and reported successful invasive weaning from MV.</p><p>With this in mind, we assessed variation in respiratory and hemodynamic parameters in tracheostomized patients who were subjected to electronic IMT (EIMT). Further, this group was compared with a group of patients subjected to an intermittent nebulization program (INP); the groups were compared in terms of MIP, rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), duration of MV, and total weaning time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a pilot, prospective, randomized study involving tracheostomized patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Clinical Hospital at the State University of Campinas.

The randomization was performed using closed envelopes, the selection being performed by one of the authors of the study accompanied by an employee of the same institution who was not participating in the research. Weaning success was defined as breathing without MV for 48 consecutive hours. Prior to data collection, each patient received physical therapy comprising bronchial hygiene therapy, tracheal and oral cavity aspiration, and positioning in bed with the head lifted at an angle of at least 30&#x000b0;.</p><p>Three MIP readings were obtained from each patient daily using a digital manovacuometer (MVD300; GlobalMed<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, MDI Produtos e Sistemas Ltda Novo, Hamburgo, Brazil). The measurement involved a one-way valve connected to both the tracheostomy tube and the equipment, a 20-s occlusion, a 1-min break between measurements, and selection of the highest MIP value. The RSBI was also checked daily using a ventilometer (Wright<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mark-8, inspector inspire health Ltd, Hertford, England).</p><p>The fraction of inspired oxygen was adjusted to 100% for 2 min before the MIP and RSBI measurements were obtained.</p><p>In the INP group following institutional protocol, the patients were subjected to an INP using a T-piece for a progressively increasing duration, until they had completed 48 h of respiratory autonomy on continuous nebulization.

This is in accordance with the study by Cader et al [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which treated intubated patients using a respiratory muscle training protocol, with a view to increasing the extubation success rate; however, of the 198 patients selected for their study, only 28 were randomized, as the majority of the population was subject to tracheostomy tube or died.</p><p>The selection of a 30% resistive load during EIMT was supported by the findings of Bissett et al [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], who evaluated patients on MV for 7 days or more and successfully weaned them from ventilation. The same authors noted that respiratory muscle endurance was reduced in a third of the studied patients immediately after MV withdrawal.</p><p>The findings of Cader et al [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also supported the resistive load selected in our study. In a randomized assay, these authors employed IMT twice a day using a load that was equivalent to 30% of the MIP, with a daily 10% increase in the training load. They found an increase in the MIP and a decrease in weaning time; 87.5% of the patients in the training group were discharged from the ICU with no need for ventilatory support. Similar results were obtained in this study; total weaning time was shorter in the EIMT group, and this was associated with significant MIP increase over the pre-training values (P = 0.017). The proportion of ICU discharges showed a similar trend in this study, because all patients who had achieved respiratory autonomy were discharged from the ICU.</p><p>In a prospective study, Epstein et al [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that MV-dependent patients who had been successfully weaned had an average MIP of 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. In contrast, patients for whom weaning had failed presented an average MIP of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. In our study, the initial mean MIPs were 43 &#x000b1; 16 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and 54 &#x000b1; 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for the INP and EIMT groups, respectively. Taken together, this may explain the successful weaning and respiratory autonomy reached in both groups.</p><p>Jubran et al [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared patients weaned using decreasing support pressure with those weaned using INP at specific times daily. Weaning time in the INP group was shorter than that in the support pressure group. Conversely, the weaning time in the EIMT group in our study was shorter than that of the INP group.</p><p>In our study, RSBI was not significantly different between the two groups, both before and after training; this is in contrast to the study by Cader et al [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the population in their study was mainly composed of elderly individuals who were on MV for a shorter period and were trained while still on tracheal intubation; both these factors may have contributed to the significant decrease in RSBI. In our study, each patient had been tracheostomized and had an MV time of 21.8 &#x000b1; 9.8 days in the INP group, and 14.5 &#x000b1; 10 days in the EIMT group; it is likely for this reason that the RSBI did not decrease. Furthermore, the RSBI value in the EIMT group in our study was already within the predictive value for successful ventilatory weaning, i.e., less than 104 cycles/min/L, with a mean of 49 &#x000b1; 16 cycles/min/L. However, patients were not yet able to acquire respiratory autonomy without respiratory muscle training.</p><p>With regards to the safety of the electronic device, the present study was in accordance with several previous studies [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], all of which used the Threshold<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> IMT device in patients dependent on MV in the ICU. In contrast, we used the POWERbreathe<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> KH2 in such patients. Therefore, the POWERbreathe<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> KH2 is equally safe, because it did not significantly or sustainably affect the HR, MAP, RR, or SpO<sub>2</sub> of the patients enrolled in this study, during or after training.</p><p>It is important to highlight that the POWERbreathe<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was initially meant exclusively for IMT in healthy and fit individuals (16 recreational runner athletes) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, it was necessary to determine the safety and applicability of the instrument in this &#x0201c;off-label&#x0201d; use, namely, the weaning of tracheostomy patients. Information is still scarce in the literature regarding the utility of electronic IMT devices in patients whose condition is severe. In a case study involving tracheostomized patient with neuromuscular disease who had been MV-dependent for 14 days, Souza et al [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported successful IMT using the POWERbreathe<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; the study was carried out in an intermediate care unit. A 30-cm H<sub>2</sub>O increase in MIP was observed after 2 weeks, allowing MV discontinuation, decannulation, and initiation of non-invasive MV. Therefore, in accordance with the results of their study, the authors concluded that IMT was safe, as hemodynamic variables did not change to the point of interrupting the IMT, and there was no need to administer supplemental oxygen. More studies are necessary to understand when, how and for how long we need to implement the muscular training in intensive care medicine before and after weaning [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It can be concluded that the electronic IMT device is safe, as it did not adversely affect HR, MAP, and SpO<sub>2</sub> variations. In addition, it may be effective since it led to an increase in MIP over pre-training values, and weaning time was shorter than in the INP group. Shorter weaning times in particular may contribute to a decrease in the incidence of MV-associated pneumonia and in hospital-acquired infection, as well as to shorter hospitalization times and, consequently, lower morbidity and mortality and decreased hospitalization-related costs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the research physiotherapists, students of specialization in physiotherapy, nurses, intensivists and PhD medical professors of the Intensive Care Unit of Clinics Hospital &#x02013; UNICAMP for their help conducting research.
