Critics of traditional RCTs, however, argue that the strict enrollment criteria and enhanced care provided to patients enrolled in clinical trials limit the external validity of the findings to routine clinical settings <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A &#x0201c;trial effect&#x0201d; demonstrating better overall outcomes among patients recruited in clinical trials, independent of the effectiveness of the intervention treatment, has previously been described <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This effect is arguably more pronounced in resource limited settings where routine care is often considerably poorer than care provided to participants of clinical trials assigned to receive &#x0201c;standard care.&#x0201d; In a large pragmatic trial on fluid resuscitation among febrile children in sub-Saharan Africa, mortality among control subjects was noted to have been 50% lower than that observed in routine practice before the trial <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0045">For childhood pneumonia, the leading single cause of childhood mortality, data from large clinical trials conducted in predominantly Asian populations were used to inform a major revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for empirical therapy. In the revised recommendations, children with indrawing pneumonia (lower chest indrawing in the absence of danger signs suggestive of more severe forms of disease) are to be managed as outpatients with oral amoxicillin in place of the previous guidelines requiring inpatient therapy with injectable penicillin <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Uptake of this policy has been poor across sub-Saharan Africa partly due to fears of the safety of home management of a population of children with a potentially high risk of mortality <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These concerns are partially addressed in a pragmatic noninferiority RCT of oral amoxicillin vs. benzyl penicillin conducted at six Kenyan hospitals <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In a parallel exercise, we collected observational data from patients who were treated for pneumonia at the participating hospitals while the trial was recruiting, but who did not take part in the trial. Reasons for not participating in the trial included refusal to provide consent or failure of the recruiting clinician to enroll the patient in the trial because they were admitted at night or during weekends when recruitment was suspended. Variations of this design have been previously applied in a limited number of studies conducted in high-income settings <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0050">We specifically sought to compare mortality among children enrolled in the RCT with a similar population of nontrial participants hospitalized at the same health facilities over the period the trial was conducted to address anticipated concerns from clinicians and policymakers regarding the generalizability of the trial results.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0055">We created a retrospective cohort of children admitted with chest indrawing pneumonia (WHO 2014 definition) at six Kenyan public hospitals. The primary independent variable was enrollment vs. nonenrollment in a RCT comparing the effectiveness of oral amoxicillin vs. benzyl penicillin for chest indrawing pneumonia <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The main outcome was mortality during the inpatient period. The study sites were average-sized hospitals with 2,500&#x02013;4,500 pediatric admissions each year. Three of the facilities were located in malaria endemic regions of the country. Four of the sites were district-level hospitals, while two were provincial referral hospitals. All six hospitals were medical internship training centers with inpatient pediatric departments headed by at least one pediatrician.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="p0060">We included children aged between 2 and 59&#x000a0;months hospitalized with pneumonia at the study sites between September 2011 and August 2013. To overcome the potential effects of alternative antibiotic treatments on clinical outcome and the challenge of accurate identification of ineligible children with undocumented exclusion criteria, we restricted the study population to children with chest indrawing at admission who were treated with either benzyl penicillin alone at 50,000 IU/kg every 6&#x000a0;hours (observational study and control group of RCT) or oral amoxicillin at 40&#x02013;45&#x000a0;mg/kg every 12&#x000a0;hours (intervention group of the RCT). Children with documented clinical diagnoses that would preclude the use of benzyl penicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy including severe acute malnutrition, HIV, meningitis, and WHO-defined very severe pneumonia were excluded. Caregivers who declined to provide written informed consent for enrollment were excluded from the clinical trial but were considered for inclusion in the observational cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Sample size</title><p id="p0065">A total of 527 children were enrolled in the clinical trial.

However, considerable effort was made to ensure overall quality of clinical care and documentation through training for clinical staff on the pneumonia guidelines at the beginning of the study and at 3&#x02013;6 monthly intervals, promotion of the use of structured patient admission forms during clinical assessment, and provision of the national pediatric guidelines to health workers. Staff also underwent a 5-day course designed for the dissemination of the Ministry of Health pediatric guidelines for health facilities called Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment Plus <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> at various times during the study period.</p><p id="p0075">Children participating in the RCT were enrolled prospectively by a trained study clinician after screening for eligibility including provision of written informed consent from caregivers. All trial participants were reviewed daily by the study clinician in consultation with a pediatrician based at the hospital.

Characteristics of the study population were summarized and compared by trial status (trial vs. nontrial participants). The univariate odds ratio for mortality between trial and nontrial participants was reported with an accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). Potential causal pathways relating enrollment in the clinical trial, patient characteristics, and mortality were developed to determine variables that would be considered potential confounders. Variables that altered the strength of the primary association in bivariate analyses were selected for inclusion in the multivariate models along with age and hospital level which were regarded as a priori covariates. To account for missing data on variables selected for inclusion in the multivariable model, multiple imputation by chained equations was performed under a missing at random assumption. This method was favored for its flexibility in handling both categorical and continuous variables <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To enhance efficiency of the imputation model, we included variables for which documentation was complete or almost complete.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p id="p0100">Medical records were available for 1,709 children aged 2&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months hospitalized at the study sites between September 2011 and August 2013, with pneumonia and treated with penicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy. Of these children, 527 (30.8%) were enrolled in the clinical trial and 1,182 (69.2%) received routine care. Two-thirds of the children (1,242/1,709) studied were hospitalized at the four district hospitals.

Our findings are consistent with the results of previously conducted clinical trials that informed a major recent revision in the WHO guidelines for the management of childhood pneumonia recommending outpatient therapy for children with lower chest wall indrawing with oral amoxicillin. The low mortality, however, contrasts with the results of previous observational studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa prior to the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine in which mortality was more than three times higher <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This difference may be partly attributed to the wide immunization coverage against the major causes of bacterial pneumonia, resulting in a relative increase in the proportion of children presenting with self-limiting viral pneumonia <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Unfortunately, the etiology of pneumonia in low-income settings in the era postintroduction of the <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines remains poorly understood <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and was not examined in our study.</p><p id="p0125">Most baseline characteristics were evenly distributed between the two groups. The disproportionately larger number of children in the trial with history of a wheeze, a symptom associated with viral bronchiolitis and reduced risk of death among young children with pneumonia <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, may suggest biased recruitment of patients who were perceived to be less sick in this group. However, the apparent difference may also be due to inadequate assessment for the presence of this symptom among nontrial participants (documentation on history of a wheeze was missing for almost half of nontrial participants). To mitigate measurement error arising from missing data, we used multiple imputation to generate the final estimates of effect. Since data for the children included in the observational cohort were collected retrospectively, it was not possible to ascertain the characteristics of this subpopulation in detail. Thus, the presence of underlying malnutrition, HIV infection, and other comorbidities that were unrecognized or undocumented by the admitted clinician could not be accounted for among the nontrial participants. While these factors suggest dissimilarity between the two groups, the comparison conducted in this study provides an important picture of outcomes among these children in real life&#x02014;a more relevant consideration for policymakers interested in understanding the risk of death within this population.</p><p id="p0130">Out of the large number of published pragmatic trials, very few attempts to demonstrate the extent to which the populations studied compare to real patients to whom the&#x000a0;findings ultimately apply. Indeed, trials designed with the intention of generating evidence to be used in &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; settings have been criticized for being more explanatory than initially intended, limiting their utility for decision-making <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The emergence of tools to aid trialists in designing studies that appropriately match their intended purposes is likely to improve the quality of both explanatory and pragmatic trials <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The possibility of selection bias can never be completely excluded in a study comparing RCT with observational evidence as pointed out above. Certainly, if results differ, the possibility that one group had worse prognosis than the other cannot be excluded. Nor, if they are similar across the trial and nontrial comparators, as in this case, is it completely safe to assume that a true difference has not been obscured. That said, the similarity in both the absolute and relative differences across trial and nontrial groups, in both the adjusted and unadjusted results, does suggest that a measure of reassurance might be derived that the trial result is generalizable in this particular case.</p><p id="p0135">A major limitation of this study was its retrospective design and reliance on routine clinical data. Missing data were encountered across several variables including clinical outcome. Although it is not possible to ascertain the true values of the missing observations, we used multiple imputation to overcome potential bias arising from exclusion of patients with missing data. The results of this analysis were similar to those of the univariate analysis excluding children with missing outcome data.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0140">Routinely collected observational data, when used to complement the findings of clinical trials, offer a valuable and low-cost opportunity for addressing the weaknesses inherent to traditional RCTs <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The validity of this approach is, however, dependent on the completeness and quality of clinical documentation which is currently a major challenge in settings where resources are deficient <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Nontrial participants had similar characteristics to those recruited in the RCT. The risk of mortality in routine care settings was comparable to that reported in clinical trials, among children who are currently proposed to receive outpatient therapy under the revised WHO guidelines. The findings add to existing evidence to further inform ongoing discussions on case management for childhood pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guyatt</surname><given-names>G.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Oxman</surname><given-names>A.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vist</surname><given-names>G.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kunz</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Falck-Ytter</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Alonso-Coello</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations</article-title><source>BMJ</source><volume>336</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>924</fpage><lpage>926</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18436948</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rothwell</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>External validity of randomised controlled trials: to whom do the results of this trial apply?</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>365</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>82</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15639683</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braunholtz</surname><given-names>D.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>S.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lilford</surname><given-names>R.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Are randomized clinical trials good for us (in the short term)?
