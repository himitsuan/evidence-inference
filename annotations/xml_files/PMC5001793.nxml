Our model includes post-op, patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine (PCA). No previous trials have compared US-guided TAP versus US-guided ILI+IHG in adult men undergoing inguinal hernia repair using the open Lichtenstein patch tension-free method.

Study eligibility was as follows: male; over the age of 18; physical status of I&#x02013;III based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists criteria; and scheduled to undergo elective inguinal hernioplasty using the unilateral open Lichtenstein patch tension-free method. The rationale only to include males in the trial was based on the aim to compare data among maximally identical groups.

Additional exclusion criteria included being under the age of 18, presence of a local skin infection near the block injection site, allergy to local anesthetics, demonstrated opioid dependency, international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.4, platelet count less than 100,000, chronic pain, dementia, or an inability to comprehend the pain scale or use the PCA device.</p><p>Patients were instructed regarding the use of a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) graded from 0 (without pain) to 100 (intolerable pain).</p><p>Based on the exclusion criteria, 20 patients were excluded from the study.

The TAP and ILI+IHG approaches represent a significant difference between investigations, with subsequent differences in the results because visualization of target structures enabled the possibility of accurately injecting the local anesthetic into the transversus abdominis plane (in TAP group) or around the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves (ILI+IHG group). Sasaoka et al.<xref rid="b15-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> in 2005 and Asad et al. in 2009<xref rid="b25-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> have indicated that the addition of a genitofemoral nerve block (genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve) to ILI+IHG provides hemodynamic stability during sac traction in children following hernia repair, i.e. a combination of the three nerve blocks provides better pain relief compared with ILI+IHG alone. For appropriate comparisons of the post-op pain relief and morphine consumption, we blocked the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve in all patients in all groups. This approach enables neutralization of painful impulses originating from structures innervated by the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. This is a significant strength of our trial and a critical difference between our investigation and that of Aveline et al.<xref rid="b8-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Our inclusion and exclusion criteria enabled the selection and comparison of similar groups of patients with regard to the pre-op data, gender (all patients were men), and patients suffering from primary inguinal hernia (but not from recurrent, sliding, or inguinoscrotal huge hernia). Primary open hernioplasty via the Lichtenstein tension-free technique was used in all patients. The same concentration and volume of local anesthetic was used for all patients in the two pre-op block groups. All pre-op blocks were performed by the same experienced anesthesiologists; an intraoperative block of the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve was performed or controlled by the same experienced surgeons. A very high level of similarity among all three groups is a strong advantage of our trial as compared to other similar studies.<xref rid="b8-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b13-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b15-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b25-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In our prospective randomized controlled and observer-blinded trial, pain intensity and morphine consumption immediately post-op (in the PACU) were significantly less in the TAP and ILI+IHG groups compared with the control group; however, there were no differences between the TAP and ILI+IHG groups themselves. This finding indicates that both methods of US-guided blocks produce significant post-op pain relief immediately after surgery, with no significant difference between the procedures.</p><p>Twenty-four hours post-op, when the action of bupivacaine has decreased significantly or has ceased, no differences in pain intensity were observed among the all groups. Total morphine and dipyrone consumption in the ILI+IHG group was significantly decreased compared with the TAP and control groups; however, the TAP and control groups were similar. This finding indicates that the ILI+IHG produces superior pain relief compared to TAP during the 24 hours post-op, but not immediately after surgery.</p><p>Our results may be explained by the hypothesis that the spread of local anesthetic during and after injection differs following TAP and ILI+IHG. Posterior TAP is a compartment block, and the spread of local anesthetic is relatively large, i.e. from Th7 to L1.<xref rid="b5-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b26-rmmj-7-3-e0021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Following ILI+IHG, the local anesthetic only spreads around the target nerves. We compared the groups with the same injected volume and concentration of bupivacaine (20 mL of 0.5%); thus, we can assume that following ILI+IHG a relatively high quantity of bupivacaine had spread around the target of the two nerves compared with the TAP block. It is possible that the quality of the compared blocks is similar immediately post-op (in the PACU); however, when the quantity of the local anesthetic around and in the nerves decreases, the quality of the blocks changes, i.e. the quality of the ILI+IHG improves. This is one potential explanation for the difference in morphine consumption over 24 hours between the TAP and ILI+IHG groups.</p><p>Our study has several limitations as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There were strong inclusion criteria: limited to men, primary inguinal hernia, and hernioplasty using the Lichtenstein tension-free method.
