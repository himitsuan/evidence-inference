Eligible patients were required to have stage I (except for T1N0), II, or IIIA histologically confirmed NSCLC, according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification. They had to be 75 years old or younger, have a Karnofsky performance score of 80 or higher, and have had curative surgical resection. Previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy was not allowed. Patients with other organic diseases were ineligible. Preinclusion investigations consisted of history and physical evaluation, chest X-ray, computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest and brain, upper abdomen CT scan or ultrasound, and isotope bone scan.</p><p>The institutional review boards of the participating centers approved the protocols used in this study. All patients provided written, informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned into either a preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery group or a surgery-alone group. Patients from both groups received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.</p><p>The chemotherapy consisted of mitomycin (6 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), cisplatin (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and vindesine (2.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1, 8, and 15. For both study arms, chemotherapy was repeated every 28 days for 4 cycles. In the preoperative chemotherapy arm, 1&#x02013;2 cycles of chemotherapy treatment had to be completed before surgery. For both arms, 4&#x02013;6 cycles of chemotherapy were given to patients after surgery. A physical examination and blood analyses were performed at each cycle during chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy were assessed according to the WHO criteria.</p><p>Surgery had to start after randomization in the surgery-alone arm and after chemotherapy in the preoperative chemotherapy arm. Upon completion of the preoperative chemotherapy treatment, all patients were assessed for their physical conditions before surgery. If patients&#x02019; physical conditions did not meet the requirement of surgery, the surgery was delayed until all parameters return to an acceptable level. Surgical resections (lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy) were performed on the basis of the chest CT scan. Mediastinal involvement was assessed by CT. Mediastinal node dissection and sampling were performed by surgeons and pathologists. Patients with pN2 stage NSCLC at surgery received postoperative thoracic radiotherapy.</p><p>Patients were followed up every 3 months until death or until the cut-off date of this study (May 1, 2012).

OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death or May 1, 2012.

Reasons for ineligibility included stage IIIB tumor (one patient), incomplete resection (eight patients), and missing follow-up (ten patients). Thus, 169 patients in the preoperative chemotherapy arm and 168 patients in the surgery-alone arm were included in the final analysis.

Among the 169 patients who received chemotherapy, the overall chemotherapy response rate was 46.7% (79 patients), and progression of disease was observed in ten patients (5.9%). Chemotherapy-associated adverse events included grade 3 to 4 nausea and vomiting, grade 3 alopecia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 to 4 neutropenia.

A total of 19 patients (6.1%) died after surgery: eight patients (5.4%) in the preoperative chemotherapy arm and eleven patients (6.8%) in the surgery-alone arm. The postoperative deaths were mainly due to a complication from surgery or comorbidities. We did not observe any differences in term of postsurgery recovery between the preoperative chemotherapy and the control arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall survival</title><p>At the time that this trial ended on May 1, 2012, 261 patients had died, including 128 in the preoperative chemotherapy arm and 133 in the surgery-alone arm.

There was no statistically significant difference in PFS between the two arms. A significant increase in PFS was demonstrated only in the stage I NSCLC patients in the preoperative chemotherapy arm.</p><p>Due to the inconsistent results from previous clinical trials, the benefit of preoperative chemotherapy in NSCLC has been long debated in the past decade. Similar to the result from our trial, several other trials have also shown that there are not benefits for NSCLC patients in having preoperative chemotherapy. Westeel et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ott-6-645">14</xref> reported the long-term results of a French randomized trial that compared preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone in resectable (stage I to IIIA) NSCLC (n = 355). After a median 13.8 years of follow-up study, these authors concluded that preoperative chemotherapy did not produce a significant survival benefit, by univariate analysis, but did produce an improved survival in stage I and II, using multivariate analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ott-6-645">15</xref> The randomized phase III trial reported by Pisters et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ott-6-645">16</xref> compared preoperative chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by surgery, with surgery alone in early-stage NSCLC patients. Although the OS and PFS were higher with preoperative chemotherapy treatment, the differences did not reach statistical significance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ott-6-645">16</xref> In the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 08012 multicenter randomized trial studied by Gilligan et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ott-6-645">17</xref> 519 patients were randomized to receive either surgery alone or 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgery. The results of this trial failed to indicate the benefits of preoperative chemotherapy in terms of OS. Consistent with these previous studies, our study also demonstrated that preoperative chemotherapy does not produce significant benefits for NSCLC patients.</p><p>On the other side, many trials have demonstrated that preoperative chemotherapy is beneficial for NSCLC patients. A trial conducted by Rosell et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ott-6-645">8</xref> assigned 60 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC to either have preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery or surgery alone. When an analysis was performed 7 years after patient enrollment, patients in the preoperative chemotherapy arm showed a significant gain in survival. The median survival of the preoperative chemotherapy arm (26 months) was dramatically longer than the surgery-alone arm (8 months) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Roth et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ott-6-645">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ott-6-645">19</xref> conducted a similar trial using chemotherapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin. In that study, the benefit in OS to the preoperative arm was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.008). Meta-analysis of randomized trials has also shown that preoperative chemotherapy improves survival in NSCLC patients. An updated meta-analysis of 13 RCTs, conducted by Song et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ott-6-645">20</xref> showed that preoperative chemotherapy significantly improved the OS of operable NSCLC patients, including patients with stage III NSCLC. However, the benefits of preoperative chemotherapy demonstrated in these trials appear to be modified by multiple factors, such as the number of enrolled patients, the differences between chemotherapy regimens, and the differences between the clinical and pathological stages.</p><p>The secondary objective of our trial was to assess the survival rate associated with clinical remission induced by preoperative chemotherapy. Although OS was higher with clinical remission after preoperative chemotherapy, the difference was not statistically significant, indicating preoperative chemotherapy was not beneficial to patients even when chemotherapy successfully acted on tumors.</p><p>There are several factors that may have affected the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy in our trial. Because patients received at least 1&#x02013;2 cycles of preoperative mitomycin-cisplatin-vindesine, chemotherapy toxicity may have been responsible for a shortened survival time in the preoperative chemotherapy arm compared with the surgery-alone arm. Furthermore, the mitomycin-cisplatin-vindesine regimen we used in this study is no longer considered to be the first-line chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC. We cannot exclude the possibility that the mitomycin-cisplatin-vindesine regimens may have been a factor that contributed to the negative effect of preoperative chemotherapy in the NSCLC patients. However, recent studies using the same chemotherapy regimen have demonstrated inconsistent results in the benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NSCLC, suggesting that the choice of chemotherapy regimen may not be a key factor in determining the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ott-6-645">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ott-6-645">16</xref> Nevertheless, minimizing chemotherapy-related morbidity and mortality should be given careful consideration when designing future trials, and this may be achieved by choosing less toxic chemotherapy regimens than the one we chose for this trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ott-6-645">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ott-6-645">23</xref></p><p>In summary, we found that preoperative chemotherapy had no survival benefits for NSCLC patients with stage I, II, and IIIA diseases. This finding emphasizes the need to develop new strategies to identify the patient subgroups that will be benefited or harmed by preoperative chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, and Shanghai Huadong Hospital.
