Primary endpoint was clinical remission throughout the double-blind phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Clinical remission during open-label treatment was achieved by 84.5% (93/110 patients). The median time to remission was 10.5&#x02005;days (95% CI (9.0 to 14.0&#x02005;days)). The maintenance of clinical remission at 1&#x02005;year was achieved by 61.4% (27/44 patients) in the budesonide group versus 16.7% (8/48 patients) receiving placebo (treatment difference 44.5% in favour of budesonide; 95% CI (26.9% to 62.7%), p&#x0003c;0.001). Health-related quality of life was maintained during the 12-month double-blind phase in budesonide-treated patients. During treatment-free follow-up, 82.1% (23/28 patients) formerly receiving budesonide relapsed after study drug discontinuation. Low-dose budesonide over 1&#x02005;year resulted in few suspected adverse drug reactions (7/44 patients), all non-serious.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Budesonide at a mean dose of 4.5&#x02005;mg/day maintained clinical remission for at least 1&#x02005;year in the majority of patients with collagenous colitis and preserved health-related quality of life without safety concerns. Treatment extension with low-dose budesonide beyond 1&#x02005;year may be beneficial given the high relapse rate after budesonide discontinuation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration numbers</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01278082) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu">http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu</ext-link> (EudraCT: 2007-001315-31).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MICROSCOPIC COLITIS</kwd><kwd>QUALITY OF LIFE</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance of this study</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known on this subject?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Collagenous colitis, a presentation of microscopic colitis, is associated with severely impaired health-related quality of life.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Oral budesonide at a dose of 9&#x02005;mg/day for 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks induces remission in 77%&#x02013;100% of patients with collagenous colitis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>After withdrawal of budesonide, between 61% and 88% of patients experience clinical relapse but long-term data on budesonide maintenance therapy, and on the use of low-dose budesonide, are lacking.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose oral budesonide therapy (mean dose 4.5&#x02005;mg/day) in patients with collagenous colitis, clinical remission was maintained to 1&#x02005;year in 61.4% (27/44 patients) in the budesonide group versus 16.7% (8/48 patients) receiving placebo (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Health-related quality of life was maintained to 1&#x02005;year with low-dose oral budesonide.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Low-dose budesonide over 1&#x02005;year resulted in few suspected adverse drug reactions (7/44 patients), all of which were non-serious.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Maintenance therapy with low-dose budesonide (mean 4.5&#x02005;mg/day) appears beneficial and safe in patients with collagenous colitis who have achieved clinical remission under standard budesonide therapy and reduces the high relapse rate observed after budesonide discontinuation.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Collagenous colitis, a presentation of microscopic colitis, is a well-recognised cause of chronic non-bloody watery diarrhoea, particularly in elderly women<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and is associated with severely impaired health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Oral budesonide, a locally active corticosteroid, has been shown in a number of randomised, placebo-controlled trials to induce remission in collagenous colitis.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref> Budesonide at a dose of 9&#x02005;mg/day for 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks induces clinical response in 77&#x02013;100% of patients,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref> and a recent meta-analysis has confirmed that budesonide therapy is associated with a threefold improvement in both short-term and long-term clinical responses compared with placebo.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Budesonide therapy is recommended by the European Microscopic Colitis Group (EMCG) as the treatment of choice for active disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, after withdrawal of budesonide 61&#x02013;88% of patients experience clinical relapse,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

Laboratory tests considered safety parameters reflecting a glucocorticoid effect (eg, serum fasting glucose, sodium, potassium).

The interim analysis indicated that no sample size adjustment was required (see online supplementary appendix 2). Assuming rates of clinical remission of 60% in the budesonide group and 30% in the placebo group at the end of the 12-month double-blind phase, with a sample size of 86 in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (34 patients up to the interim analysis, 52 patient subsequently), the study had 80% power to yield a statistically significant result (one-sided &#x003b1;=0.025). In order to include the required number of patients for the double-blind phase, approximately 110 patients were to be treated in the open-label phase.</p><p>For hypothesis testing of the primary endpoint, the overall (experimentwise) type I error rate was one-sided &#x003b1;=0.025. The rates of remission were compared between treatment groups in a group-sequential adaptive test design using the inverse normal method of combining the p values of normal approximation tests, and additionally by two-sided 95% RCIs. All other statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Fisher's exact test, t test) were performed two-sided with a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05 on an exploratory basis.</p><p>In a post hoc multivariate analysis, the predictive values of clinical parameters (ie, age, gender, smoking status, concomitant drugs, family history of IBD, mean number of stools/watery stools per day) at baseline and at randomisation on relapse in the double-blind phase were calculated using a logistic regression model. p Value-based stepwise variable selection was applied to identify the final model. Efficacy was analysed for the ITT population, comprising all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication, with a sensitivity analysis for the per-protocol (PP) population. Patients who did not meet eligibility criteria, provided no post-randomisation efficacy criteria, showed lack of compliance (&#x0003c;75% study medication administration), received study medication for &#x0003c;300 days without early discontinuation or discontinued early due to adverse event without causal relationship with study drug were excluded from PP population. Safety analysis was performed descriptively for the safety population. Statistical testing of the primary endpoint was done via the ADDPLAN system (V.6.0.1, ADDPLAN GmbH, K&#x000f6;ln, Germany). All other analyses were conducted using the SAS V.9.2 statistical package for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>In total, 148 patients were screened, of whom 110 met the eligibility criteria and were recruited to the open-label phase.

in the budesonide group showing suspected adverse drug reactions was 15.9% (7/44 patients), with all suspected adverse drug reactions being non-serious. The majority of suspected adverse drug reactions were skin and subcutaneous disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="GUTJNL2014308363TB2">table 2</xref>B).</p><p>It is noteworthy that double-blind treatment with budesonide was more than twice as long as treatment with placebo (291.2 (141.5)&#x02005;days vs 138.1 (125.1)&#x02005;days; mean (SD)).</p><p>Morning serum cortisol, measured precisely between 8:00 and 10:00, was available both at baseline and at final visit in 61.4% (27/44) of budesonide-treated patients and 37.5% (18/48) of placebo-treated patients. A shift from normal morning cortisol levels at baseline to below-normal at the final visit occurred in 3.7% (1/27) of budesonide patients and 5.6% (1/18) of placebo patients. There were no clinically relevant changes in serum fasting glucose, sodium or potassium. A clinically relevant increase in HbA1c was observed in two patients with diabetes in each treatment group (budesonide and placebo). There was no substantial increase in mean (SD) body weight: budesonide group 0.4 (3.4)&#x02005;kg, placebo group 0.1 (2.3)&#x02005;kg. None of the patients on budesonide or placebo gained more than 10% of weight during the entire course of treatment. Mean blood pressure values remained within the normal range: values at the baseline versus final visit were 135/81&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg versus 136/83&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in the budesonide group, and 131/78&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg vs 130/78&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in the placebo group.</p><p>Withdrawal of study medication due to an adverse event during the double-blind phase occurred in four patients on low-dose budesonide versus seven patients on placebo. Tolerability of the study medication was mainly assessed by the investigators as very good or good (budesonide: 70.5% very good, 25.0% good; placebo: 62.5% very good, 22.0% good). The corresponding values based on patients&#x02019; assessments were 75.0% and 20.5% for budesonide, and 62.5% and 25.0% for placebo.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomised trial to assess low-dose budesonide therapy (mean 4.5&#x02005;mg/day) for the maintenance of remission in collagenous colitis. The results showed that low-dose budesonide therapy maintained clinical remission for at least a year in 61.4% of patients, which was significantly higher than in placebo-treated patients (16.7%). Furthermore, the open-label phase of the study confirmed the high rate of clinical remission achieved with budesonide 9&#x02005;mg/day, which has been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref> Indeed, half of all patients were in remission after only 10&#x02005;days&#x02019; treatment. Two previous randomised trials have evaluated the efficacy of oral budesonide in maintaining remission in patients with collagenous colitis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Both of these studies used a dose of 6&#x02005;mg/day and followed patients for 6&#x02005;months, defining remission as three or fewer stools per day. Bonderup <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> observed a remission rate of 76.5% at month 6 among a cohort of 17 patients treated with budesonide, remarkably similar to the rate of 73.9% reported by Miehlke and colleagues<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in a group of 23 patients. However, comparisons between these trials and the current study should be regarded cautiously since different definitions of remission and relapse were used. We applied the Hjortswang Criteria<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> for disease activity in microscopic colitis, which takes into account not only the frequency of stools but also the consistency.</p><p>When introducing long-term therapy with budesonide, the main goal should be to find the lowest dose that maintains clinical remission while avoiding side effects. Given that the current trial used an average dose of 4.5 mg/day and followed patients for a year instead of 6&#x02005;months, the remission rate of 61.4% observed here is encouraging. The need for long-term therapy in the majority of patients is reflected by the high rate of relapse (82.1%) observed when low-dose budesonide was discontinued after 1&#x02005;year. A relapse rate of approximately 80% after cessation of budesonide treatment is a relatively consistent finding in randomised, controlled trials,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> independent of whether high-dose induction or maintenance therapy was given. This indicates that these patients have a chronic active disease and that the long-term course cannot be altered by medical treatment. Interestingly, relapses occurred primarily within 3&#x02005;months irrespective of whether patients received low-dose budesonide, placebo or stopped treatment after 1&#x02005;year. If patients remained in clinical remission beyond this critical time point, there was a high likelihood that remission would be sustained.</p><p>Multivariate analysis indicated that the risk of clinical relapse was higher in patients with more severe symptoms at baseline, that is, a high number of watery stools per day and in younger patients. Furthermore, a higher number of stools per day after induction treatment with budesonide (prior to randomisation) were associated with a greater risk for relapse. This is in line with the observation that budesonide improves the consistency of the stool prior to a decrease in total stool numbers. These results are consistent with a recent multivariate analysis by Miehlke <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> based on pooled data from 123 patients in four randomised controlled trials that reported clinical remission after budesonide withdrawal. They found that a baseline stool frequency of more than five per day was associated with almost a fourfold increase in the risk of relapse after stopping budesonide therapy. Interestingly, we found that the risk of relapse decreased significantly with increasing age (p&#x0003c;0.05) or, in other words, younger patients showed a higher risk of relapse. This is one of the first studies to apply the criteria for clinical remission proposed by Hjortswang and colleagues,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> that is, a mean of &#x0003c;3 stools/day, including a mean of &#x0003c;1 watery stool/day within the previous 7&#x02005;days. A careful analysis of quality of life data led to this definition of remission based on both stool frequency and stool consistency<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which are conveniently documented in everyday practice. Stool consistency, rather than frequency of stools, appears to be the main determinant of quality of life impairment in collagenous colitis,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and as such is a highly relevant measure of treatment efficacy from the patient's perspective. A patient with fewer than three stools a day may still be a suitable candidate for intervention if the stools are watery, leading to urgency or faecal incontinence and thereby limiting quality of life.</p><p>Clinical status was closely mirrored by health-related quality of life measurements. Achievement of clinical remission during the open-label phase was accompanied by a very pronounced improvement in quality of life, particularly in relation to symptom burden and social function. This improvement, importantly, was largely sustained throughout the 1-year maintenance therapy phase.</p><p>The safety analysis did not raise any new concerns for this well-known topically acting glucocorticoid. It is noteworthy that during the whole study there were no serious adverse drug reactions due to budesonide. Interestingly, intake of a low dose of budesonide (mean 4.5&#x02005;mg/day) over 1&#x02005;year did not result in more frequent suppression of serum morning cortisol than treatment with placebo. It is still prudent to monitor closely any patient on long-term budesonide since synthetic glucocorticoids may have effects on various organ systems and do not only affect skin and subcutaneous tissues.</p><p>Some aspects of the study design merit consideration. The trial used a rigorous double-blind methodology and was adequately powered for the primary endpoint. Endoscopy at the final visit of the double-blind phase was optional, but histological samples were available for only 16 budesonide patients and eight placebo patients at this time point. Thus, regretfully, a meaningful assessment of histological remission or improvement was not possible. Lastly, recruitment to the study took place over a period of approximately 4&#x02005;years, although additional centres in additional countries were initiated.</p><p>In conclusion, budesonide at a mean dose of 4.5&#x02005;mg/day is an effective and safe long-term maintenance therapy in collagenous colitis, which preserves health-related quality of life. This dosage regimen was not associated with a safety concern. Ongoing treatment with low-dose budesonide to maintain clinical remission in collagenous colitis may be beneficial in view of the high relapse rate after budesonide discontinuation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2014-308363-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1751" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web tables</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2014-308363-s2.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1756" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all patients and investigators for their participation and contribution to the study.
