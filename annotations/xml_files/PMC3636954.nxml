The most serious consequence is the loss of the periodontal support structure, which includes cementum, the periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The regeneration of a periodontium destroyed by periodontal disease has been an elusive goal sought by all who treat periodontal problem. One of the biggest challenges in periodontics is the treatment of infrabony defects. Osseous defects can be treated with resective therapy but may result in significant tissue recession and unaesthetic appearance. However, regenerative treatment for osseous defects has the potential for replacing lost tissues and minimizes tissue recession. Moreover, the bone grafts appear to increase the chance of new attachment when compared with debridement alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Various reports on the filling in of bone defects after periodontal surgery suggest a considerable degree of bone fill and others have found residual bone defects after surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The unpredictability of filling in of bone defects after periodontal surgery has resulted in the investigation of various types of bone graft materials and of synthetic implants materials.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite ceramics come very close to fulfilling the criteria for the ideal bone substitute. The most important feature of hydroxyapatite when compared with other inorganic materials is its unique biologic properties as it consists of only calcium and phosphate, which is found in the human organism and no toxicity or defence reaction is expected. The biocompatibility, tolerance, and biologically active property of hydroxyapatite make it an ideal bone substitutes. The porous hydroxyapatite is a pure uniquely resorbable hydroxyapatite (HA) implant material used for alloplastic augmentation and the repair of bone defects. The material used is chemically and crystallographically equivalent to the mineral portion of human bone, specifically hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub>10</sub> (PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub> OH<sub>2</sub>]. The material was available under the product name of &#x0201c;PERIOBONE-G&#x0201d; marked by Top-Notch Health Care Product Pvt. Ltd., India.</p><p>Plaster of Paris (calcium sulfate) is one the most versatile materials used in dentistry. Calcium sulfate can function as resorbable space filler, a resorbable barrier a vehicle for control released chemotherapy and as a biocompatible, biodegradable compound a composite mixture with other bone grafts, better tissue healing, and rare post operative complication. All of these properties contribute to its usefulness in periodontal surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Dressman[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] first used calcium sulfate to fill bony defects. Bell[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] demonstrated resorption of calcium sulfate was 4.7 weeks in dogs. Najjar[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] shows that hydroxyapatite and calcium sulfate composite enhances bone formation within few weeks in animals. Sottosanti,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Anson,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Bier and Sinesky[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] observed that calcium sulfate can be effectively used as a resorbable barrier in human periodontal osseous defects. Orsini[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] reported no significant difference between pocket depth and clinical attachment level in those sites treated with autogenous graft alone and combination of autogenous graft with calcium sulfate (Capset) as a barrier over 6 months study period.</p><p>Capset (Lifecore Biomedical Inc., USA), calcium sulfate bone graft barrier is used to cover the underlying bone graft and to prevent it from displacement during postoperative healing and also it can be used as a composite graft material. Medline search using keywords such as interproximal defects, calcium sulfate, barriers, and periodontitis revealed minimal studies.</p><p>Hence, this study has been undertaken to assess treatment response of interproximal vertical defects using an alloplast (Periobone-G) and calcium sulfate (Capset) as a barrier both clinically and radiographically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Science review committee approved protocol for human subjects.

The scanned images, stored in JPEG format were transferred to COREL DRAW 7. For measurement, connector line tool was used. The cementoenamel junction (CEJ), the base of the defect, and the crest of alveolar bone were located on the image. Using the connector line tool, a line is drawn from CEJ to base of the defect. The length of the line was displayed in the size property box of the software. The software then displays the distance between these 2 points. The same procedure was then repeated to obtain the distance between CEJ and alveolar crest. Subtracting the 2 measurements the depth of the osseous defect was obtained. By using the above method for pre-and postsurgical radiographs, the radiographic measurements were obtained for each site. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was done at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>All the selected patients were subjected to Phase-1 therapy 4 weeks prior to surgery.</p><p>Patient was seated comfortably on the dental chair and then asked to rinse the mouth with 10 mL of 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution.

The operative site was anesthetized with 2% xylocaine HCl with adrenaline (1:80000), using block and infiltration techniques. The crevicular incisions were given on the facial and lingual sides using the bard parker handle no. 3. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected using the periosteal elevator, taking care that the interdental papillary tissue was retained as far as possible. After reflection of the flap and exposure of osseous defect, thorough surgical debridement of both soft and hard tissues was done using curettes and scissors. After completion of root planning, the surgical site was irrigated with 0.9% normal saline, and then root surfaces were conditioned with tetracycline hydrochloride solution [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Site showing debridement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-96-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Interproximal defect with UNC-15 Probe</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-96-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Tetracycline root conditioning</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-96-g003"/></fig><p>In the control site, the defects were filled with hydroxyapatite granules (Periobone-G), the required quantity of hydroxyapatite granules was transferred to the dappen dish and moistened with sterile saline, which was then placed into the vertical defect with the help of scoop of cumine scaler (Hu-Friedy), to the approximate level of the crest of the remaining osseous walls.</p><p>In the experimental site, hydroxyapatite granules were used to fill the osseous defect and calcium sulfate (Capset) barrier was placed.

Loss of alveolar bone support is one of the characteristic signs of destructive periodontal disease. But now due to the expansion of horizons in the field of treatment modalities, the present goal of periodontal therapy is not only focused at eliminating infection form the diseased sites but also aimed at restoring the tissues lost, to the original level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>In the previous decades, number of new materials has been used in the treatment of periodontal osseous defects, which includes various types of GTR membranes and variety of bone graft material. Many types of bone grafts have been used with varying degrees of success, including autografts, allograft, xenograft, and alloplastic materials. Alloplastic materials are the bone substitutes, such as calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate, bioactive glasses, which are biocompatible with host tissues, resorbable in appropriate time, and scaffold for ingrowth of tissue cells to lay down tissue matrix. Because of these reasons bone substitutes have been used since 100 years.</p><p>Periobone-G (hydroxyapatite) developed as a bone implant material has long been the subject of extensive investigation. This material chemically and crystallographically equivalent to the mineral portion of human bone, specifically hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>OH<sub>2</sub>]. The material is devoid of local or systemic toxicity, does not elicit inflammatory or foreign body responses, can become functionally integrated with natural bone, and causes no alteration of normal bone mineralization process.</p><p>Capset is calcium sulfate bone graft barrier used to cover the underlying bone graft and protect it from displacement during postoperative healing.</p><p>By considering the above properties of Periobone-G and Capset, this present clinical study was conducted.

The primary outcome variable can be measurement of new bone formation. Direct measurements, including linear and volumetric assessments are by far best tools. However, the need for second surgical procedure is a definite drawback of this technique. To overcome the difficulties, indirect methods of alveolar bone measurement have been utilized with various degree of success. Radiographic bone measurements following regenerative procedures is a noninvasive, painless alternative to direct bone measurements. Conventional radiography offers simplest and most cost-effective radiographic method but has limited sensitivity and potential geometric distortion. One approach designed to avoid there potential error is taking standardized radiographs to establish reproducible source tooth film geometry. Image processing techniques facilitates minute osseous changes following regenerative therapy of intrabony defects occurs in the intrabony component of the defect, while crestal bone apposition is minimal and in some cases net crestal resorption occurs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Measurement of the periodontal defects from a fixed reference point to the base of the alveolar defect has some value for monitoring osseous changes following regenerative treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The radiographic techniques used in the study include longcone/paralleling technique in combination with digital processing of the images to measure bony changes.</p><p>In the current study, defect fill was evident in both control and experimental sites.

The use of calcium sulfate as a barrier proved its role in the treatment of interproximal defects. The application of calcium sulfate (Capset) barrier is easy and simple. The multifaceted properties of calcium sulfate demonstrate its usefulness in periodontal practice. The ease of availability and cost of calcium sulfate scores better over other GTR barrier in day-to-day periodontal surgical work. However, Capset is expensive and not available in India.</p><p>Furthermore, studies should be directed using Capset as a composite bone graft material in various osseous defects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Dent</surname><given-names>HD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>LF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biologic and clinical considerations for autografts and allograft in periodontal regeneration therapy</article-title><source>Dent Clin North Am</source><year>1998</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>467</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9700450</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bowers</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Schallhorn</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mellonig</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Histologic evaluation of new attachment in human infrabony defects.
