A key attribute of such a vaccine will be its ability to induce protective antibodies in the vagina and cervix that could prevent transmission of HIV to women of child-bearing age, without compromising fertility. This approach is supported by non-human primate (NHP) studies demonstrating that neutralizing antibodies can prevent vaginal acquisition when administered by intravenous infusion or applied topically to the vagina [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the relative importance of antibody levels in secretions versus mucosal tissue and the role of non-neutralizing antibodies in vaginal acquisition has yet to be fully defined [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The modest reduction in risk of HIV acquisition in the human RV144 &#x0201c;Thai&#x0201d; efficacy trial is thought to correlate with polyclonal non-neutralizing antibodies against the V1V2 region of gp120, in particular the IgG1 and IgG3 subclass, associated with antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Interestingly, high systemic levels of envelope (Env) specific IgA targeting the same epitopes were directly correlated with risk, although mucosal levels of specific IgG and IgA were not determined [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Different strategies for optimal induction of vaginal antibody responses have been explored in a number of animal models. These studies led to the concept of immunological linkage between the upper respiratory tract and lower genital tract [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, preclinical studies of intranasal (IN) immunization of mice with HIV gp140 were shown to elicit specific antibodies in vaginal secretions [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nasal immunization with CTB has been associated with vaginal antibodies in humans and induced stronger responses than those seen with direct IVAG immunization [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], although no comparison was made to parenteral vaccination. Currently the only examples of vaccine-induced protection against cervico-vaginal viral infection are the two licensed parenteral vaccines against human papillomaviruses [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These responses are assumed to be due to transudation of neutralizing IgG from the plasma into cervico-vaginal tissue and/or secretions [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There has only been one previous clinical study of parenteral vaccination with recombinant gp140 alone (in the absence of DNA or viral vector priming), this included limited immunological analysis and did not assess vaginal antibody levels [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Data on the effects of direct vaginal vaccination in humans are extremely limited. In preclinical studies direct vaginal administration of gp140 in mice fails to induce local and systemic antibody responses, whilst in NHP this approach is partially effective and in rabbits it appears to be highly effective [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, clinical studies of direct vaginal vaccination with gp140 in the absence of a parenteral prime have thus far failed to induce mucosal antibody responses [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first comparative Phase I clinical trial in women to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of three HIV-1 clade C gp140 immunizations delivered by intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN) and intravaginal (IVAG) routes with a specific focus on antibody responses to gp140 in cervico-vaginal secretions and in serum. The choice of a clade C immunogen was based on the high global prevalence of this HIV-1 subtype and in particular for its relevance to sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Vaccines</title><p>The recombinant clade C HIV-1 envelope gp140 protein (CN54gp140) is a naturally cleavage resistant, envelope clone of 97CN54 [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The primary objective was to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccination regimes in healthy female volunteers aged 18&#x02013;45 years who were at low risk for HIV infection. The trial was open-label with laboratory assessment staff blind to regimen throughout and the participants blind to the dose administered in the intramuscular regimen. Eligible female participants were randomised centrally into one of the four groups using a computer-generated algorithm based on random permuted blocks stratified over one factor (clinical centres) aiming to enroll 10 individuals into each of the IM20, IM100 and IVAG groups and 6 into the IN group (as there were no responses following IN immunization in a preceding macaque experiment; at SGUL), 36 in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152038.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Statistical Software Stata (StataCorp. 2011. Release 12. College Station, TX) was used by the trial statistician to create the randomization sequence with variable block sizes (3 and 6 for HYMS; 4, 8 and 12 for SGUL). Women in the IVAG group received a single IM prime (100ug) followed by two IVAG immunizations. Volunteers from the IM100 and IN groups were invited back to receive two further boosts of 100 &#x003bc;g gp140 adjuvanted with GLA-AF IM 4 weeks apart within 12&#x02013;24 weeks of the last vaccination (full details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152038.s005">S1 Study Protocol</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0152038.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0152038.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT Flow diagram.</title><p>Numbers of participants recruited into the trial &#x0201c;Analysis 1&#x0201d;is the original protocol schedule to week 20 incorporating the planned main analysis.

All the participants completed their immunizations and there were no severe adverse reactions reported (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0152038.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Serum CN54gp140 IgG responses were detected in the majority of participants in the two parenteral groups. There was no statistical difference between the groups, suggesting the lower dose of gp140 (20 &#x003bc;g) was similar to the standard dose (100 &#x003bc;g) when administered with adjuvant. There were no detectable serum IgA responses. This may reflect the adjuvant properties of GLA-AF. Given the potential negative correlation of specific systemic IgA in the RV144 trial [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] this may be a positive characteristic of the GLA formulation. Detectable specific vaginal IgG (softcup) was significantly correlated with serum IgG titer, likely reflecting transfer of systemic antibody into the vagina by passive transudation [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is likely that the frequency of detectable vaginal antibody would be increased using strategies that elicit higher systemic responses. However, the systemic and mucosal antibodies were not necessarily correlated as there were some individuals who had systemic responses of a similar magnitude in the absence of any specific mucosal IgG, suggesting factors in addition to serum titer may influence IgG transfer to the vaginal lumen. The only previous clinical study of an HIV-1 subtype D gp140 envelope protein formulated in alum also showed antibody responses in all nine of the trial participants. It is not possible to compare data between two studies as only very limited immunological analysis of serum antibody response was reported using a clinical diagnostic ELISA with no indication of serum dilutions. Mucosal and cellular responses were not assessed [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Serum IgG responses were highly focused on the immunodominant V3 loop. This is reflective of a number of gp140 immunogens recently evaluated in non-human primate models [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. V3 dominated responses were mirrored by the low level of detectable neutralization to closely matched tier 1 isolates. Binding intensity to the V3 region positively correlated to the neutralization of TH023.6 and only modestly with neutralization of MW965.26. Interestingly, as in rabbits and macaques [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], serum antibodies did not recognize the gp41-immunodominant domain (residues 598&#x02013;609) [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and showed no significant binding to any part of gp41. This suggests that the gp41 region of the molecule may be occluded from immune recognition, potentially avoiding induction of diverting responses associated with gp41-cross reacting microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The lack of any detectable ADCC activity likely reflects lack of response to dominant epitopes associated with ADCC, typically V1/V2, C1 and gp41 [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CN54 gp140 is naturally cleavage resistant constraining its ability to adopt a native-like conformation. It is anticipated that next generation stabilized cleaved soluble trimers may provide significant gains in neutralization breadth and potency [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Antibody responses to HIV-1 gp140 are thought to be dependent upon CD4 T- follicular helper (Tfh) cells. The paucity of detectable systemic CD4 T-cell responses in the two IM groups, despite robust antibody responses, suggests that required Tfh responses are likely restricted to the germinal centers of localized lymph nodes, and/or do not circulate in sufficient numbers at sampled time points (1 and 4 weeks post third immunization) to be detected. The observed paucity in CD4 response following parenteral immunization is in marked contrast to the IN group where 80% of participants had detectable circulating CD4 T-cell responses as assessed by CD154 expression (CD40L, a marker of T cell activation) in the apparent absence of detectable serum or vaginal antibody responses. It is unclear why we saw no effect of IN chitosan on humoral immunity, given that previous clinical studies have shown that chitosan promoted potent antibody responses to other immunogens [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but it may be that these were intrinsically more antigenic. However, the induction of CD4 T-cell responses suggests effective uptake of CN54gp140 by local antigen presenting cells, and subsequent presentation to CD4+ helper T cells. These data contrast with early preclinical studies from our group in mice, which suggested that chitosan efficiently promoted both humoral systemic and mucosal responses to CN54gp140 [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152038.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Interestingly, all participants in the IN group that agreed to the boosting protocol immediately responded to the first IM boost with serum antibody responses equivalent to those in the parenteral groups after three immunizations. Thus IN administration appeared to act as a mucosal prime for subsequent systemic immunization. It is unclear whether priming was restricted to induction of CD4 T cell help or included priming of antibody responses that were too low to be detected. However the rapid anamnestic response on IM immunization is supportive of a boosting of primed antibodies rather than de novo priming at inductive sites. The possible dependence on potential adjuvant properties of chitosan cannot be inferred in the absence of a control arm. It is likely that higher doses, and/or the inclusion of a more potent mucosal adjuvant, could provide more positive immunogenicity data, even during the priming phase [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Vaginal CN54gp140-specific IgG antibody was detected in 36% and 44% of volunteers in the parenteral IM20 and IM100 groups, and at low intermittent levels in one individual in the IVAG group. There was no evidence for induction of specific IgA responses in any group, including the IVAG group. We did however observe evidence of pre-existent, polyreactive CN54gp140-binding IgA in two individuals prior to vaccination, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The lack of IVAG boosting following a single IM prime contrasts to our previous studies in macaques where a single IM immunization primed animals for induced antibody following IVAG immunization [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, animals received 9 IVAG immunizations (100 &#x003bc;g each) over one menstrual cycle, as opposed to two higher doses (500 &#x003bc;g) used in this human study. Lack of responsiveness following IVAG administration may reflect the absence of mucosal adjuvant, prompted by our desire to minimize any local immune activation that might enhance HIV susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, in a different human study using CN54gp140 and HSP70 as an adjuvant, IVAG administration also failed to induce detectable systemic or mucosal antibody responses [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, in recent studies a wider range of adjuvants failed to induce vaginal antibodies in NHP [<xref rid="pone.0152038.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this study comparing different routes of administration demonstrates that IM administration of CN54gp140 elicited potent systemic IgG responses in the majority of subjects, and detectable vaginal IgG in just over a third. The observation that the lower dose of CN54gp140 (20 &#x003bc;g) was similar to the standard dose (100 &#x003bc;g) when formulated with GLA-AF adjuvant, provides opportunities for dose sparing regimes. Interestingly, IN administration induced detectable CD4 T cell responses and primed subsequent intramuscular boosting, while IVAG administration in the absence of adjuvant had no detectable impact on systemic or mucosal responses in spite of IM priming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152038.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist MUCOVAC2.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152038.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152038.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Measurement of total IgG (black symbols) and total IgA (red symbols) mucosal secretions.</title><p>Data shown in either soft cup samples at weeks 0, 5, 8, 12, 16 and 20 (a) or cervical-os Weck-cel samples, (b) or vaginal vault Weck-Cel cel samples (c) at weeks 0, 5 and 12.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152038.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152038.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Cytokine Multiplex Bead Array (MBA) analysis measured in participants at weeks 0, 9 &#x00026;12.</title><p>Panel a) IL-2 responses, b) IL-5 responders are shown as red symbols and blue symbols non-responders.
