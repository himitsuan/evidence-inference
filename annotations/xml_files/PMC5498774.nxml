As new guidelines in this context, particularly for health care-associated (HCA) infections, would be needed, we performed a trial documenting whether an empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is more effective than the standard one for these infections. Because of the higher daily cost of broad-spectrum than standard antibiotics, we performed a cost analysis to compare: 1) total drug costs, 2) profitability of hospital admissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This retrospective observational analysis was performed on patients enrolled in the trial NCT01820026, in which consecutive cirrhotic patients with HCA infections were randomly assigned to a standard vs a broad-spectrum treatment. Antibiotic daily doses, days of treatment, length of hospital stay, and DRG (diagnosis-related group) were recorded from the clinical trial medical records. The profitability of hospitalizations was calculated considering DRG tariffs divided by length of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We considered 84 patients (42 for each group). The standard therapy allowed to obtain a first-line treatment cost lower than in the broad-spectrum therapy. Anyway, the latter, being related to a lower failure rate (19% vs 57.1%), resulted in cost saving in terms of cumulative antibiotic costs (first- and second-line treatments). The mean cost saving per patient for the broad-spectrum arm was &#x020ac;44.18 (&#x02212;37.6%), with a total cost saving of about &#x020ac;2,000. Compared to standard group, we observed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay from 17.8 to 11.8 days (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.002) for patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The distribution of DRG tariffs was similar in the two groups. According to DRG, the shorter length of hospital stay of the broad-spectrum group involved a higher mean profitable daily cost than standard group (&#x020ac;345.61 vs &#x020ac;252.23; +37%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study supports the idea that the use of a broad-spectrum empirical treatment for HCA infections in cirrhosis would be cost-saving and that hospitals need to be aware of the clinical and economic consequences of a wrong antibiotic treatment in this setting.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>profitability</kwd><kwd>diagnosis-related group</kwd><kwd>cost saving</kwd><kwd>antibiotic failure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial infections occur in about one-third of hospitalized cirrhotic patients, with an incidence 4&#x02013;5-fold higher than in hospitalized patients with other diseases.<xref rid="b1-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The main types of infections in those patients are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (25%&#x02013;31%), urinary tract infection (20%&#x02013;40%), pneumonia (15%&#x02013;21%), and bacteremia (12%).<xref rid="b2-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Bacterial infections in cirrhosis are associated with poor outcomes (mortality is higher about 4 times), accounting for about 30%&#x02013;50% of deaths in cirrhotic patients.<xref rid="b5-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The prognosis is particularly severe in the absence of prompt adequate therapeutic treatment.<xref rid="b9-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Early diagnosis and appropriate empirical treatment of infections in cirrhosis are crucial; a delay in starting antibiotic therapy is associated with a relevant mortality increasing by the hour.<xref rid="b12-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Since 2000, third-generation cephalosporins have been considered the gold standard in the treatment of most infections in patients with cirrhosis because of their effectiveness against Enterobacteriaceae and non-enterococcus streptococcus and also because of their low hepatic and renal toxicity.</p><p>However, these recommendations were based on the results of trials carried out in the 1980s and 1990s, when the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of the infections were very different. In the last decade, in fact, gram-positive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens have become more prevalent, particularly in the nosocomial setting, as a result of the progressive shift in care from home to health care facilities.<xref rid="b14-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In a large prospective study on cirrhotic patients with infections, multiresistant bacteria (18%) were isolated in 4% of community-acquired (CA) and 35% of hospital-acquired (HA) infections.<xref rid="b2-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the more recently individuated epidemiological class, including infections occurring in patients who had previous recent contacts with the health care system (health care-associated [HCA] infections), a rate of 14% of MDR was reported in cirrhotic patients.<xref rid="b14-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>As a consequence, the efficacy of empirical antibiotic treatment progressively decreased from CA to HCA and HA infections.<xref rid="b9-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>From these observations, it can be inferred that the choice of an antibiotic treatment needs to be more accurate and personalized based on epidemiological class, the presence of risk factors for MDR, and the local microbiological pattern.</p><p>Recent international guidelines, updated in 2012, and an international position statement published in 2013 have suggested new therapeutic approaches to CA and HA infections.<xref rid="b12-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The high rate of antibiotic resistance (14%&#x02013;50% in different countries) in HCA infections, and their poor prognosis has sparked off a debate about the possible advantages or disadvantages of using a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a first-line treatment in these infections.<xref rid="b9-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> No controlled trials were available on this matter, and HCA infections are still usually treated as CA with a detrimental effect on survival.

A randomized trial (NCT01820026) was performed in which 96 consecutive patients with cirrhosis hospitalized with HCA infections were randomized to receive a standard (48 patients) or a broad-spectrum (48 patients) antibiotic treatment.<xref rid="b18-ceor-9-385" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In this study, the broad-spectrum therapy was associated to a lower rate of failure than the standard therapy (18% vs 51%; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

Moreover, in a post hoc analysis, reduction of mortality was more evident in patients with sepsis.</p><p>Because of the higher daily cost of broad-spectrum antibiotics than standard antibiotics, we performed a cost analysis in order to evaluate the medical direct costs of the two antibiotic treatments. The primary aim of the cost analysis was the comparison of total drug costs and length of hospital stay upon using a broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with respect to using standard antibiotic therapy.

No specific indications exist for antibiotic treatment of HCA bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients.</p><p>A clinical trial was performed to compare standard antibiotic therapy with broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy in cirrhotic patients with HCA infections. The broad-spectrum approach significantly reduced in-hospital mortality vs standard therapy (12% vs 31%; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). The improvement in survival was the result of the lower therapeutic failure (broad spectrum 19%; standard 57%), with infection resolution for all infectious sites. The need of a second-line treatment and the length of hospital stay were lower in the broad-spectrum group. As a consequence of the above reported clinical results, we performed a cost analysis focused on antibiotic treatment (broad-spectrum therapy vs standard therapy) and hospitalization costs (DRG tariffs).</p><p>The cost savings per each patient treated with the broad-spectrum therapy, compared with the standard therapy, were attributable to the lower failure (second-line treatment), which represents the main driver in the reduction of treatment costs. The mean cost per patient treated was &#x020ac;117.43 with broad-spectrum therapy and &#x020ac;161.59 with standard therapy. The total cost to treat all patients in broad-spectrum group (n=42) was 4,931.90, and it was 6,786.92 to treat all patients in standard group (n=42). Although standard therapy led to treatment costs lower than the broad-spectrum one in terms of first-line treatment, the latter, being related to a lower rate of treatment failure, was cost saving, considering the treatment costs of second-line treatments. The broad-spectrum therapy cost saving for total antibiotic treatment (first and second line) was 37.6%.</p><p>The profitability of hospital admissions, calculated on DRG tariffs, for patient treated with broad spectrum was higher than standard therapy (&#x020ac;345.61 vs &#x020ac;252.23). The lower length of hospital stay of broad-spectrum therapy (11.8 days vs 17.8 days) determined a 37% higher &#x0201c;hospital admissions daily-profitability&#x0201d; compared with standard group.</p><p>Unfortunately, since similar analyses are currently not available in the medical literature, and so it is not possible to compare the results obtained in this cost analysis with the results from other studies.</p><p>A possible limitation in the current analysis could be attributed to the use of DRG tariffs as a &#x0201c;proxy&#x0201d; for the hospitalization costs. However, data obtained through DRG tariffs represents a valid source for carrying out a cost analysis on the profitability of hospital admissions. Another limitation is that the present results cannot be fully generalized, since the clinical trial we referred to was monocentric and conducted in a country with a high prevalence of MDR bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study supports the idea that the use of a broad-spectrum empirical treatment for HCA infections in cirrhosis would be cost-saving and that hospitals need to be aware of the clinical and economic consequences of a wrong antibiotic treatment of these diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
