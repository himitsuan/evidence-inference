We have previously reported in two clinical trials that a DNA vaccine encoding PAP (pTVG-HP) could elicit PAP-specific, Th1-biased T cells in patients with PSA-recurrent prostate cancer. In the current pilot trial we sought to evaluate whether this vaccine could augment PAP-specific immunity when used as a booster to immunization with sipuleucel-T in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Eigthteen patients with mCRPC were randomized to receive sipuleucel-T alone or followed by intradermal immunization with pTVG-HP DNA vaccine. Patients were followed for time to progression, and immune monitoring was conducted at defined intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Overall, patients were followed for a median of 24&#x000a0;months. 11/18 patients completed treatments as per protocol. No treatment-associated events &#x0003e; grade 2 were observed. Th1-biased PAP-specific T-cell responses were detected in 11/18 individuals, and were not statistically different between study arms. Higher titer antibody responses to PAP were detectable in patients who received pTVG-HP booster immunizations. Median time to progression was less than 6&#x000a0;months and not statistically different between study arms. The median overall survival for all patients was 28&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These findings suggest that prime-boost vaccination can augment and diversify the type of immunity elicited with anti-tumor vaccination in terms of T-cell and humoral immunity. Future studies will explore DNA as priming immunization rather than a booster immunization.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01706458">NCT01706458</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sipuleucel-T</kwd><kwd>DNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>Prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>Prostatic acid phosphatase</kwd><kwd>Immune monitoring</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA014520</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Sipuleucel-T was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer based on data from a randomized clinical trial demonstrating an improvement in overall survival compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While the median improvement in overall survival was only 4&#x000a0;months, this is as comparable to other agents that have been approved for this stage of prostate cancer, including docetaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], cabazitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], abiraterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], radium-223 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and enzalutamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Subsequent retrospective studies have suggested that patients with lower burdens of disease, and those who developed evidence of immunity to the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) target antigen with either antigen-specific IgG or T cells, might have had a superior outcome in terms of longer overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Consequently, these findings suggest that the target of this vaccine, PAP, is a rational vaccine target antigen for prostate cancer treatment. Moreover, these findings suggest that using combination vaccine approaches to increase the immunological activity of sipuleucel-T to PAP might lead to superior clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par7">We have evaluated PAP-targeted vaccines using plasmid DNA as the means of antigen delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In two phase I trials evaluating dose and schedule in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (castration-sensitive and castration-resistant), we found vaccination to be safe and able to elicit PAP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1 phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Unlike results from trials using sipuleucel-T, DNA vaccination did not elicit PAP-specific antibodies in either trial. The frequency of PAP-specific T cells was augmented with subsequent immunization, and the development of durable Th1-biased immune responses (detectable up to one year after treatment) appeared to be associated with favorable changes in PSA doubling time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on these results, a randomized phase II trial evaluating this vaccine is currently underway to determine whether treatment can delay the time to development of metastases in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (NCT01341652).</p><p id="Par8">The ability of a DNA vaccine to elicit and augment Th1-biased immunity to PAP suggests it might be useful in a prime-boost strategy with sipuleucel-T, particularly since both vaccines target the same PAP antigen. Given that sipuleucel-T is an approved therapy delivered three times at two-week intervals, we sought to evaluate an approach in which DNA immunization was delivered after sipuleucel-T, as a booster immunization. We describe here the results of a pilot randomized clinical trial (NCT01706458) in which patients with mCRPC received sipuleucel-T alone (3 times at 2-week intervals), or sipuleucel-T (3 times at 2-week intervals) followed by DNA immunization 4 times at 2-week intervals, and then at months 6 and 9 after study initiation. The primary endpoint of the study was to determine if DNA vaccination could augment PAP-specific effector and memory T cells following treatment with sipuleucel-T. Secondary and exploratory objectives included effects on other measures of immunity, progression-free survival, and overall survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Investigational agent and regulatory information</title><p id="Par9">pTVG-HP is a plasmid DNA encoding the full-length human PAP (ACPP gene) cDNA downstream of a eukaryotic promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The primary endpoint was to determine if booster immunizations could augment the antigen-specific T-cell immune response rate. The accrual goal was 28 patients to identify an increase in immune response rate by 50% with &#x02265;&#x02009;80% power at a one-sided 5% significance level. Subjects in Arm 1 received sipuleucel-T as per standard of care, three times at two-week intervals. Subjects in Arm 2 received sipuleucel-T as per standard of care, three times at two-week intervals, and then received four biweekly immunizations with pTVG-HP (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g per immunization, co-administered intradermally with 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g GM-CSF adjuvant (sargramostim, Genzyme, Cambride, MA) at weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12, and then further immunizations at months 6 and 9. DNA immunizations were delivered as an intradermal injection in the deltoid region with a 28-guage needle and syringe. Patients underwent a leukapheresis procedure within two weeks prior to the first sipuleucel-T product collection and at month 6 for immunological monitoring. Additional 100&#x000a0;mL blood draws were performed at weeks 6, 12, and month 9 and 12 for immunological monitoring. All subjects were followed for at least one year, with staging CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, and bone scintigraphy, performed every 12&#x000a0;weeks. Patients remained in long-term follow-up for up to five years to identify any potential long-term risks. Patients came off study at month 12, at the time of radiographic progression, at any time of undue toxicity, or at the discretion of the patient or treating physician that other therapies for prostate cancer were warranted. In order to account for possible delayed treatment effects, patients did not come off trial for radiographic progression at week 12 unless there was symptomatic progression requiring new therapy. Radiographic progression was defined using modified RECIST/PCWG2 criteria, however using scans obtained at week 12 as the baseline study for comparison. Patients also received a tetanus immunization immediately following the baseline leukapheresis. Blood tests were performed every 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks and included CBC, creatinine, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, LDH, bilirubin, serum PAP, and serum PSA. Serum testosterone was performed at baseline to confirm that patients were functionally castrate (testosterone levels &#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;ng/mL).

All subjects received a tetanus booster immunization prior to beginning the immunization series, providing a separate test of an individual&#x02019;s immune responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Responses to PSA, a non-target prostate-specific protein, were concurrently evaluated, as were responses to GM-CSF, a component of the PA2024 fusion protein used in the preparation of sipuleucel-T. Samples were evaluated for antigen-specific IFN&#x003b3; or granzyme B secretion by ELISPOT, and the detection of statistically significant antigen-specific responses, that were at least 3-fold over the baseline value, and detectable more than once post-treatment, were used to define immune response to a particular antigen, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In order to account for this and possible delayed effects of treatment on progression, patients were evaluated for time to progression using scans obtained at month 3 as a new baseline scan. While the trial was not powered to detect difference in time to progression, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, there were no differences between study arms in terms of time to progression (median 161&#x000a0;days in Arm 1 vs. 164&#x000a0;days in Arm 2). Of note, however, two patients treated in Arm 2 (ID010 and ID015) had evidence of progression at month 3 compared to baseline, however then remained on trial without progression until month 9 and 12, respectively, at which point radiographic progression beyond month 3 was detected. All other patients with evidence of progression at month 3 had evidence of further progression by month 6.

Studies in preclinical models and human trials have shown increased antigen-specific T cells and/or antibodies using this approach in infectious disease and tumor systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Notably, in the case of viral or bacterial vector vaccines, the use of heterologous prime-boost approaches has been critical to avoid neutralizing immunity to the vector while augmenting immunity to the intended target antigen. This, in fact, was the approach used in the PSA-TRICOM vaccine targeting PSA as a prostate tumor antigen, using vaccinia virus encoding PSA as a priming immunization followed by booster immunizations with fowlpox encoding PSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We have previously investigated a vaccinia vector encoding PAP and found that multiple immunization with that vector elicited a dominant response to the vector, not the target antigen, and this could be circumvented by booster immunization with either PAP protein or DNA encoding PAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given that DNA encoding PAP alone could elicit Th1-biased T cell immunity to PAP without eliciting vector-specific immunity, we have explored it in early clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. At present, the only FDA-approved anti-tumor vaccine is sipuleucel-T, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer that similarly targets the prostate-specific antigen PAP. Given the availability of two vaccines each targeting this tumor antigen, the current trial evaluated whether T-cell responses to PAP could be augmented using them in a prime-boost approach. We found that with this sequence of administration, with sipuleucel-T followed by DNA immunization, there was no evidence of increased Th1-biased response to PAP.</p><p id="Par22">This is the first trial to evaluate long-term effector and memory T cell immunity to PAP following sipuleucel-T treatment. We found that IFN&#x003b3;- and granzyme B-secreting T cells specific for PAP were amplified with treatment, and could be detected up to at least one year following treatment in some individuals. Of note, PAP-specific granzyme B-secreting immunity was detected in half of patients at week 6 after completing the sipuleucel-T infusions. Antibody and Th1-biased cellular responses were also detected to GM-CSF. This is not surprising, as the PA2024 antigen used for activation of autologous cells in the manufacture of sipuleucel-T is a fusion protein of PAP and GM-CSF. The finding in our study that IFN&#x003b3;-secreting response specific for GM-CSF were detectable in several individuals (5/16, 31%) who did not have an IFN&#x003b3;-secreting response specific for PAP likely accounts for previous findings that the frequency of responses to the PA2024 antigen are higher than those detected to the native PAP antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. That is, many patients likely develop immunity to the GM-CSF portion of the fusion protein. We have previously reported that immunity to GM-CSF can occur following immunization with GM-CSF protein, and to date there has been no evidence of adverse effect from immunity to GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">This trial was not powered to detect differences in time to progression or overall survival, and no obvious trends were observed. Median overall survival was 28&#x000a0;months, which is consistent with previous trials conducted with sipuleucel-T in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Embedded within the trial design was an attempt to determine if treatment might slow the progression of disease. Specifically, in previous trials using anti-tumor vaccines conducted in this population, the median progression-free survival was about 12&#x000a0;weeks, at the first radiographic imaging time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Treatment on the current trial was permitted beyond 12&#x000a0;weeks in order to determine if subsequent imaging showed stable disease, thus our results cannot be directly compared with previous studies using sipuleucel-T in terms of time to progression. Notwithstanding, using this approach, only two patients with evidence of progression at 3&#x000a0;months had stable disease after that, suggesting that delayed disease stability, if it occurs, is not common. Similarly, no differences were observed in pre-treatment and post-treatment PSA doubling times overall or for either treatment arm.</p><p id="Par24">The trial was designed to test whether a DNA vaccine could boost cellular immunity elicited by sipuleucel-T. It was designed in this way given that sipuleucel-T is an approved therapy, and we did not want to potentially delay administration of an approved treatment. In addition, a prescribed course of sipuleucel-T involves three administrations at 2-week intervals, and is not amenable to large schedule interruptions or retreatment at later time points. Thus, the simplest design was to use a DNA vaccine after completing sipuleucel-T treatment. In retrospect, this was likely not the optimal design. First, the majority of patients had disease progression requiring study discontinuation before receiving multiple DNA immunizations, suggesting that, although safe, it may not be clinically feasible to sequence vaccines alone in this patient population when progression occurs quickly. In addition, nearly all studies to date evaluating DNA vaccines in heterologous prime-boost approaches, whether in preclinical models or human trials, have demonstrated that a preferred sequence of immunization is using DNA as the priming immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In fact, an early study demonstrated that DNA priming followed by a booster immunization with a herpes simplex viral protein elicited a Th1-biased immune response, whereas the opposite sequence elicited a Th2-biased response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given that sipuleucel-T elicits both Th1 and Th2 immunity to PAP, we suspect this Th2 response was preferentially boosted with DNA leading to an increased IgG response. A preferred approach may have been to use the DNA immunization prior to sipuleucel-T. In preclinical studies using the same DNA vaccine encoding PAP or a <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> vector encoding PAP, we have found that priming with DNA followed by <italic>Listeria</italic> boost, and not the opposite sequence, elicited the most robust Th1-biased cellular immunity and anti-tumor response (manuscript in preparation). Consequently, future studies will explore heterologous prime-boost approaches using DNA as the priming immunization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par25">Our findings demonstrate that delivery of two vaccines encoding the same target antigen, using a DNA vaccine as a booster vaccine following treatment with sipuleucel-T, is safe and can augment and diversify the type of immunity elicited with anti-tumor vaccination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful for the assistance of the research staff of the UWHC infusion center, UW pharmacy research center, clinical research coordinators and staff, treating physicians, and the participation of the patients and families.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par26">This work was supported by an investigator-initiated clinical trial award from Dendreon Corporation, and by National Institutes of Health P30 CA014520.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par27">The data generated and/or analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EW, LEJ, and LD conducted and analyzed laboratory studies described; JCE was study biostatistician during design and analysis; MJS and GL led and supervised clinical trial and conduct; DGM designed protocol and oversaw analysis; all authors contributed to the writing and approval of the final manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><sec id="FPar3"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par28">The study protocol was reviewed and approved by all local (University of Wisconsin Human Subjects&#x02019; Review Board (IRB), UW protocol CO11816), and federal (FDA, NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee) entities.
