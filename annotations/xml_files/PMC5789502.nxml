In this study, we compared the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) dexmedetomidine (0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg vs. 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg) in preventing desflurane EA in children aged 2&#x02013;10 years, undergoing elective cataract surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh (NK/841/MD/3332&#x02013;33) and was registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) CTRI/2014/06/004694. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children. Children, aged 2&#x02013;10 years, with ASA I status, undergoing elective cataract surgery were included in our study. Sixty-five children were assessed for eligibility, and 59 met inclusion criteria of which six were excluded because of parent's consent refusal. Hence, 53 patients were randomized into two groups using computer-generated permuted block randomization and kept in opaque-sealed envelopes. Group D<sub>0.15</sub> (<italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub>=27) received 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg IV and Group D<sub>0.3</sub> (<italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub>=26) received 0.30 &#x003bc;g/kg IV dexmedetomidine [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The anesthesiologist not involved in the study opened envelope and prepared the drug. Children with airway abnormalities precluding the use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA), tumor or infection of orbit, raised intraocular pressure, known adverse effects to dexmedetomidine, or psychiatric illness associated with agitation were excluded from the study. No premedication was given. Parental presence was facilitated during induction of anesthesia. An observer blinded to groups evaluated modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale (m-YPAS)[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] preoperatively. Anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 40%:60% mixture of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)/nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) using a face mask and appropriate-sized LMA was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with N<sub>2</sub>O:O<sub>2</sub> (60%:40%) and desflurane (4%&#x02013;6%) with cumulative minimum alveolar concentration of 1&#x02013;1.2 with spontaneous respiration. If required (when EtCO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003e;45 mmHg), ventilation was assisted to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 45 mmHg. The study drug (diluted in 10 ml syringe) was administered over 5 min slowly. A sub-Tenon block with 0.08&#x02013;0.1 ml/kg of 0.5% bupivacaine and 15 mg/kg IV acetaminophen was administered for pain relief. No opioid was administered preoperatively or intraoperatively. HR, arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal carbon dioxide, and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded after induction (baseline), after LMA insertion, at sub-Tenon injection, at surgical incision, and then at 5-min intervals until the end of surgery or more frequently when complications such as oculocardiac reflex occurred. When HR decreased abruptly by 20% or more,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the surgeon was asked to discontinue muscle traction and atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV was administered. Mean arterial pressure or HR increase of more than 20% above baseline, if present, was treated by administering rescue analgesic 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg IV bolus of fentanyl. At the end of surgery, N<sub>2</sub>O was switched off, 100% O<sub>2</sub> was administered, and LMA was removed in deeper plane. Desflurane was turned off after LMA removal. Complications related to airway, sub-Tenon block, or surgery were documented. Then, the child was shifted to PACU and SO<sub>2</sub>, electrocardiography, pain score,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and noninvasive pressure were recorded every 15 min and monitored for an hour.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-12-28-g001"/></fig><p>The state of agitation was assessed in the postoperative period using Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] scale and postoperative pain using face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) pain[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] scale every 10 min and monitored for an hour.

Significant reduction in EA was also found in 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg IV dexmedetomidine. However, this dose did not completely eliminate EA (11%) and was associated with higher PAED scores when compared to 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg (0%). Hence, 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg IV dexmedetomidine was found to be superior to 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg group in effectively reducing EA and analgesia with lower PAED and FLACC scores, respectively.</p><p>EA is not clearly defined and has been used interchangeably with emergence delirium. Sikich and Lerman[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] defined EA as &#x0201c;a disturbance in child's awareness and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in immediate postanesthesia period&#x0201d;. This cognitive disturbance is overlapped by various confounding factors such as preoperative anxiety, pain, and other factors contributing to the restlessness of child in immediate postoperative period.</p><p>In our study, we tried to eliminate these confounding factors. We facilitated parental presence reducing anxiety as measured by m-YPAS at parental separation and mask induction with decreased and comparable scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Pain is also a confounding variable associated with EA. We attempted to eliminate pain as a confounding variable in both groups through effective sub-Tenon block (0.08 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.5%)[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and IV paracetamol (15 mg/kg). We also found lower pain scores in both groups with significant lower FLACC scores in 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg group than 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg. This can be explained by the analgesic and opioid sparing effect of increased dose of 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine with comparable postoperative complications such as nausea and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have used variable doses of dexmedetomidine in preventing EA.</p><p>Jeongmim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the effects of continuous perioperative infusion of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h dexmedetomidine in 96 children aged 1&#x02013;5 years undergoing strabismus surgery following desflurane anesthesia.

They observed a reduction in agitation from 37% in placebo group to 17% and 10%, respectively, in dexmedetomidine 0.15 ug/kg and 0.3 ug/kg groups. No side effects such as bradycardia or hypotension were noted suggesting safety of these doses.</p><p>However, unlike many previous studies, we used validated scales such as m-YPAS[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for preoperative anxiety assessment, PAED scale[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for assessment of postoperative agitation, and FLACC score[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for postoperatively pain assessment. The incidence of EA in our study using desflurane anesthesia was 11% in 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg group and 0% in 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg group. Furthermore, we have chosen pediatric cataract surgery with highest incidence of EA using similar doses of dexmedetomidine as age group (2&#x02013;10 years) and ophthalmic surgery have much higher incidence of EA (28%) compared to lower abdominal and genital surgery (12%).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Although in our study, a drop in HR was observed intraoperatively in both the groups after administration of dexmedetomidine with a greater drop in 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg group at 5, 10, and 15 min (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) with comparable rates; thereafter, no bradycardia was reported.
