The predominant part (80%) of strokes is ischaemic including cases secondary to cardiac embolisms due to atrial fibrillation (AF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>The risk of stroke in AF patients can be quantified by various scoring systems. The most commonly used scheme for stratifying risk of stroke is the CHADS<sub>2</sub> (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age&#x02265;75&#x02005;years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (double weight)) score which has a range 0&#x02013;6. In low-risk patients recent guidelines have recommended use of the extended CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc (Vascular disease, Age 65&#x02013;74&#x02005;years, (female) Sex category) score which supplements the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score by two additional items and an alternative scoring of age with doubled weight to age &#x02265;75&#x02005;years (range 0&#x02013;9).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>Patients with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and bradycardia are treated with cardiac pacing. Recently, the Danish Multicenter Randomized Trial on Single Lead Atrial Pacing versus the Dual Chamber Pacing in Sick Sinus Syndrome (the DANPACE trial) comparing AAIR and DDDR pacing in patients with SSS found no difference in mortality or occurrence of stroke between the two groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>Thromboembolic events occur with a higher rate in patients with SSS and AF is common in this patient population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5 R6">3&#x02013;6</xref> Patients with SSS therefore may share the same risk factors for stroke as patients with known AF. Although the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score systems were constructed to address stroke risk in AF patients these score systems may be useful in other groups of cardiac patients. We therefore hypothesised that for patients with SSS treated with pacemaker therapy, the risk of stroke and the risk of death could be assessed by applying the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The DANPACE trial has previously been described in detail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In brief, the trial randomly assigned 1415 patients with SSS to AAIR pacing or DDDR pacing. The criteria for inclusion were: symptomatic bradycardia; documented sinoatrial block or sinus-arrest with pauses &#x0003e;2&#x02005;s or sinus bradycardia &#x0003c;40 bpm for more than 1&#x02005;min while awake; PR interval &#x02265;0.22&#x02005;s if aged 18&#x02013;70&#x02005;years or PR interval &#x02265;0.26&#x02005;s if aged &#x02265;70&#x02005;years; and QRS width &#x0003c;0.12&#x02005;s.</p><p>The main exclusion criteria were: atrioventricular block; bundle branch block; long-standing persistent AF (&#x0003e;12&#x02005;months) or permanent AF; AF with ventricular rate &#x0003c;40 bpm for &#x02265;1&#x02005;min or pauses &#x0003e;3&#x02005;s; a positive test for carotid sinus hypersensitivity, planned cardiac surgery; or a life expectancy shorter than 1 year. Documented paroxysmal AF was not an exclusion criterion. Enrolment began in March 1999 and was terminated in June 2008.</p><p>The trial was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The study was registered in Clinical Trial Gov (NCT00236158). All patients gave written informed consent before inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patient follow-up</title><p>Patients were clinically evaluated and pacemaker check was done after 3&#x02005;months and then once every year after implantation until September 2009. In case of suspected thromboembolic events (stroke or TIA), supplementary information on hospital admissions, diagnosis of the event and degree of disability was collected from hospital files and general practitioners. Once every month, new deaths were identified by checking the study database against the Danish Civil Registration System.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Definition of stroke</title><p>Stroke was recorded in the study Case Report Form (CRF) using clinical evaluations. Stroke was defined as: sudden development of focal neurological symptoms lasting more than 24&#x02005;h. Decision on diagnostic CT or MRI scans was left to the discretion of the physician treating the patient, typically general practitioners, specialists in internal medicine or neurologists. Stroke endpoints were evaluated by an independent endpoint committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The hypotheses of the current study were established prior to data analysis. Time to first stroke and time to death were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Following the lines from the primary DANPACE publication a univariate analysis of each prespecified variable was performed. Furthermore, multivariate analysis including all significant univariate variables was performed. When oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment was used as a time-dependant covariate, the latest known value for a given patient (OAC or no OAC) at a given time (as opposed to the baseline value) was used in the Cox calculations to find the model coefficients. C statistics was calculated using Harrels's C of concordance. Relative risk was expressed as HR with 95% CI. Statistical tests were two-tailed, and p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata V.11 (StataCorp. 2009, College Station, Texas, USA) and BMDP release V.8.1 (Statistical Solutions Ltd, Ireland).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Population</title><p>A total of 1415 patients were included in the analysis.

Results are based on more than 6000 patient-years of follow-up. The main findings of our study were that the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores could be used to assess risk of new stroke and death in this population of patients paced for SSS irrespective of the presence of AF. Age and prior stroke/TIA were the most significant components of the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores associated with future stroke.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>CHADS<sub>2</sub>, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc and stroke</title><p>The CHADS<sub>2</sub> and the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores were originally constructed to evaluate risk of stroke in patients with AF with the purpose of clarifying the possible need of antithrombotic therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p><p>We found that the association between the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores and stroke was still significant when analysing only the patients without a history of AF at baseline in our cohort. The significance of the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores in a non-AF population has not been well established. In a recent study of patients with acute coronary syndrome, Po&#x000e7;i <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> also found that the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score could be used to identify non-AF patients at high risk of subsequent stroke. A retrospective study of patients screened for ischaemic heart disease (343 with AF and 2945 without) demonstrated that the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score was a powerful tool to predict stroke and mortality, but presence of AF was an independent predictor of these outcomes even after correction for CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>The reason for the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores being able to predict stroke risk in a non-AF population is unclear. It is well known that SSS and AF often coexist. Our results indicate that patients with SSS share many of the same risk factors as AF patients. It may be that these risk factors predict increased risk of stroke, preceded or not preceded by AF. The risk factors contained in the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores may in future studies prove to be associated with stroke in other patient groups and in the general population. Nonetheless, these results suggest that OAC should be considered in patients paced for SSS, irrespective of the presence of AF. This however, needs further investigation, ideally in a randomised trial testing the possible net benefits of OAC versus no OAC in SSS patients without AF (and without other indications for OAC treatment) and with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> or CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of &#x02265;1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>AF, OAC and stroke</title><p>The number of strokes reported in the present study with more than 6.000 patient-years of follow-up is comparable with the observation of 90 strokes in 5664 patient-years of follow-up reported in The Mode Selection Trial (MOST) in SSS patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Similar numbers were reported in small-sized studies of SSS patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>In our study a rather large proportion (44%) of the patients had a history of AF at baseline and at the end of the study 62% of the total cohort had either AF at baseline or &#x02018;new&#x02019; AF documented by ECG or mode switch. However, this number is most likely underestimated since it was not possible to detect mode switch in the AAIR-paced group of patients.</p><p>It is well established that AF increases the risk of stroke.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> However, excluding these patients from our analyses did not change the results. A possible explanation could be that all AF patients in the present study were appropriately anticoagulated and therefore had a reduced risk of stroke compared with other AF-populations. The method used for AF detection during follow-up in the present study was relatively non-sensitive, recording an ECG once per year. This may also explain why we could not confirm a recent report by Healey <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> indicating that short episodes of AF detected by the pacemaker also increases the risk of stroke. However, we did find a higher &#x02018;mode-switch burden&#x02019; among the DDDR-paced patients who developed a stroke during follow-up, supporting the association between AF and stroke.</p><p>OAC is known to reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients significantly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> The number of OAC-treated patients increased from 14% to 24% during the course of the trial and the use of OAC was associated with a markedly lower risk of stroke. Nonetheless, excluding patients receiving OAC at baseline did not change the association between the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores and stroke, nor did adjusting for OAC in the multivariate analysis. This finding may be explained by appropriate anticoagulation of patients with AF at high risk of stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>CHADS<sub>2</sub>, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc and mortality</title><p>The CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores were not primarily designed to predict mortality.

Likewise, the sensitivity of the analysis of OAC as a time-dependant variable may also be slightly limited. Since OAC treatment strategies for AF patients have changed since the course of this trial (1999 to 2008) favouring more anticoagulation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> this could also have influenced the number of OAC-treated patients and number of strokes in the AF group.
