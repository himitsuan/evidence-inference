Historically, very few women have been enrolled and few clinical gender-specific analyses have been conducted during the development of CV therapies <xref rid="pone.0111558-Maas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A certain number of CV agents have been approved for use in men and in women, but effects were evidenced only or predominantly in one of the two genders: the male one. Just as example, the statins have been approved in primary prevention of CV diseases but the scientific evidence was reached only in men (WOSCOPS) <xref rid="pone.0111558-WestofScotlandCoronaryPrevention1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The under enrolment in trials for CV diseases still persists <xref rid="pone.0111558-Raz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Most CV medications present a sexual dimorphism in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties <xref rid="pone.0111558-Franconi3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In particular, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is sexual dimorph. The ACE/AngII/AT(1)R and ACE2/Ang(1&#x02013;7)/MasR and AT(2)R pathways are enhanced in men and in women, respectively <xref rid="pone.0111558-Hilliard1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The RAAS system is regulated by sexual hormones. In particular, it has been suggested that estrogen increases angiotensinogen levels and decreases renin levels, the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), density of AT(1) receptor and aldosterone generation <xref rid="pone.0111558-Komukai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Additionally, estrogen increases AT(2) receptor and angiotensinogen <xref rid="pone.0111558-Franconi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111558-Hilliard1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and natriuretic peptides <xref rid="pone.0111558-Komukai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The influences of androgens on RAAS are less known, but testosterone seems to increase renin levels and ACE activity <xref rid="pone.0111558-Hilliard1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Clinically, one meta-analysis shows that ACE-inhibitors are less effective in reducing mortality in women with symptomatic heart failure than in men, whereas ACE-inhibitors do not modify the survival in women with asymptomatic heart failure <xref rid="pone.0111558-Shekelle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In women at high CV risk, ACE-inhibitors reduce CV events when used as secondary prevention <xref rid="pone.0111558-Seeland1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, an Australian study evidences a decrease in CV events in men but not in women <xref rid="pone.0111558-Wing1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, cough and angioedema are more frequent in women than in men during treatment with ACE-inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0111558-Mackay1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111558-Slater1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Notably, men but not women with the XPNPEP2 C-2399A genotype, characterized by high plasma levels of aminopeptidase inactivated metabolites, are susceptible versus ACE-inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0111558-WoodardGrice1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Whereas, ACE-inhibitor-related cough seems to be associated in a sex specific manner with polymorphism of the bradykinin receptor 2. Saliently, the majority of women and men discontinue ACE-inhibitor therapy because of cough and hypotension, respectively <xref rid="pone.0111558-Shah1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In general, the previous observations evidence that there is still the need to understand and overcome the gender differences in CV medicine and this need is specifically valid for drugs that interfere with RAAS and that are a mainstay CV therapy <xref rid="pone.0111558-vonLueder1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, we analyzed, with a gender approach, studies performed with zofenopril, an ACE-inhibitor with a high potency, significant tissue selectivity and a long duration of action <xref rid="pone.0111558-Borghi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111558-Ambrosioni1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and with lisinopril and ramipril. In doing that, a retrospective pooled analysis of the four double-blind randomized, prospective SMILE Studies (Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long Term Evaluation) was performed separately assessing treatment effect on men and women <xref rid="pone.0111558-Ambrosioni2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111558-Borghi4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Notably, the SMILE studies individually proved the prognostic benefit of zofenopril reducing the 1-year occurrence of major CV events versus placebo or versus ramipril and lisinopril in men and women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) <xref rid="pone.0111558-Ambrosioni2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111558-Borghi4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The four SMILE studies enrolled patients in almost all European Countries, with a high heterogeneity for gender attention and awareness according to World Economic Forum, being the Northern Countries in very high positions, while Mediterranean Countries have a low position <xref rid="pone.0111558-Hausmann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Indeed between the Northern and the Southern European Countries there are enormous differences in dietary habits which could deeply affect the fitness of CV system. Therefore data were analyzed also considering the geographical residency of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and population</title><p>Detailed description of the study design and of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for each of the four SMILE trials is reported in the original publications <xref rid="pone.0111558-Ambrosioni2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111558-Borghi4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment. Trial registration numbers are not available for SMILE-1 Study (protocol no. 31,188-07), SMILE-2 Study (Protocol no. ZOF-07) and SMILE-3 Study, because the studies were performed in the nineties, when registration was not mandatorily required. SMILE-4 Study (protocol MEN/03/ZOF-CHF/001) was registered with EudraCT Number 2004-001150-88 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu">www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu</ext-link>) and with the Italian Ministry of Health Code: GUIDOTT_III_2004_001 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it">https://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Treatments</title><p>In all studies, patients were randomly allocated to treatment with zofenopril or comparator (placebo, lisinopril or ramipril). No lead-in observational period was foreseen prior to randomization, except for the SMILE-4 Study. In this study, patients meeting eligibility criteria entered a 4-day open label phase prior to randomization, when zofenopril was administered to all patients according to the up-titration scheme described above. This choice was based on ethical and regulatory reasons, based on previous evidence of efficacy and safety of the early zofenopril treatment in patients with anterior AMI <xref rid="pone.0111558-Borghi4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Randomized active drug treatment was given in addition to standard recommended therapy for AMI. The initial dose of zofenopril was 7.5 mg twice daily and was progressively doubled up to the final dose of 30 mg twice daily if systolic blood pressure remained &#x0003e;100 mmHg and if there were no signs or symptoms of hypotension. Zofenopril up-titration was done according to the following scheme: 7.5 mg twice daily on day 1 and 2, 15 mg twice daily on day 3 and 4, 30 mg twice daily on day 5. The doses of the active comparators were up-titrated as well: up to 10 mg once-daily for lisinopril and up to 5 mg twice-daily for ramipril. Randomized treatment was continued for 6 to 48 weeks and patients were seen at enrollment and every 1 to 6 months, depending on the Study. For all studies, duration of treatment and follow-up periods overlapped, the only exception being represented by the SMILE-1 Study. In this trial, on completion of the 6 week double-blind treatment period, the patients stopped taking the study medication but continued treatment with their other medications for additional 48 weeks, at which time vital status was blindly evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The present is a meta-analysis of individual patient data, based on raw data from each of the four SMILE Studies. The objective was to evaluate the impact of gender on treatment efficacy in patients with AMI treated with zofenopril, placebo or other ACE-inhibitors.</p><p>Since all the four SMILE Studies provided information on fatal and non-fatal CV events, the primary study endpoint of this retrospective analysis was set to the 1-year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes. The efficacy end-point derived from the four Studies was calculated after weighing for the number of subjects contributing from each study. The efficacy analysis was carried out on the intention-to-treat population, made up of all randomized patients treated with at least one dose of study medication and documenting at least once the measure of the primary efficacy assessment, even in case of protocol violation or premature withdrawal from the study. The safety analysis was applied to all randomized patients, by assessing the incidence of adverse events and changes in laboratory data or ECG during the study. The measure of safety used in this pooled analysis was the rate of drug related adverse events expressed as the number of drug related adverse events divided by the person-time-at-risk throughout the observation period.</p><p>The baseline characteristics and the distribution of variables in the study populations and subgroups were compared using a Chi-square test for categorical variables and a Student t-test for continuous variables.</p><p>This meta-analysis was conducted using a one-step approach, which evaluates the individual patient data from all studies in a single step, whilst accounting for clustering of patients within studies <xref rid="pone.0111558-Debray1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The standard pair wise direct comparison approach was followed in order to asses differences among treatments <xref rid="pone.0111558-Caldwell1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Relative risk reductions and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by a Cox proportional-hazard regression model in which treatment group, gender (males vs. females), country, age (&#x0003c;65 years vs. &#x02265;65 years), BMI (&#x0003c;30 vs. &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), diabetes (yes vs. no) and presence (yes vs. no) of a major CV risk factor (previous angina, previous congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease, prior coronary artery bypass graft percutaneous coronary intervention) were included as a covariate. In order to account for the different duration of follow-up among the four studies, the relative risk of CV morbidity and mortality was assessed using a time-dependent Cox regression model. Survival curves were drawn using Kaplan-Meier estimates and they were compared using the log-rank statistics. A subgroup analysis by country of origin (Northern vs. Southern Europe) was also made.</p><p>All p values are 2-sided and the minimum level of statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05. Data are shown as mean &#x000b1; SD or as mean and 95% confidence interval or as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies. All analyses were performed by SAS software version 9.1.3.

Indeed, there are numerous differences between men and women regarding diagnosis of CV diseases, and short- and long-term mortality rates. Women are also associated with poorer in-hospital and long-term prognosis <xref rid="pone.0111558-Papakonstantinou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the present pooled individual analysis of four randomized, double-blind, prospective studies, including patients from several European countries, we confirmed that women with AMI are older than men and have more CV risk factors than men, including diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, we documented that the risk for CV hospitalization and death, is 18% higher, and survival free from events is lower, in women than in men. Our results confirm that in the modern era CV diseases are a natural killer also for women, and not exclusively for men <xref rid="pone.0111558-Solimene1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, we demonstrated that living in the North of Europe increases the incidence of major CV events by 80%.

This finding is in contrast with the myth that living in Mediterranean countries might be protective. Although we have no data to explain the origin of our finding we might speculate that women may have received less prompt and/or effective care than men, and this might be particularly the case for residents in Southern regions of Europe. Likely, the time has come for a major paradigm shift of ecological differences in health outcomes and for the fact that changes in the lifestyle and behavior might be essential in the causation of CV diseases <xref rid="pone.0111558-Perk1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Indeed, these results indicate that geographical localization should be considered in studies focused on gender aspects.</p><p>Undoubtedly, women remain underrepresented in most clinical trials and few clinical gender-specific analyses have been conducted during the development of CV therapies <xref rid="pone.0111558-Maas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In this context, the retrospective evaluation of the SMILE studies according to gender confirms and expanded the current knowledge on gender differences in drug response. We confirmed that the proportion of women enrolled into the study, although in line with that of many other studies, is still poorly represented <xref rid="pone.0111558-Schmotzer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111558-Dodd1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We also showed that in post-AMI patients, the effect of ACE-inhibition in terms of CV outcome prevention was better in men than in women, supporting findings from previous studies in patients with CV disease <xref rid="pone.0111558-Shekelle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111558-Wing1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, our study provided new interesting findings. The gender differences in the response to treatment seem to depend on the geographical location rather than on the pharmacological treatment itself, since such differences are smaller among people living in Northern Europe and larger in people residing in Southern Europe. The reduction in the risk of 1-year CV morbidity and mortality induced by zofenopril versus placebo was not associated with gender. However, when the effect of zofenopril was compared with that of the other ACE-inhibitors, it was larger in men than in women. Although gender-related differences in the response to treatment with the various ACE-inhibitors used in our study might be related to chemical and pharmacological features of the compounds and their interaction with gender-specific characteristics, we have no data to support any hypothesis on the origin of our findings. However, to our knowledge, such an intra-class difference in the CV effect of ACE-inhibitors has never been reported. Further studies should explore this aspect in the future.</p><p>Cough and angioedema, two adverse drug reactions typically associated with ACE-inhibition and two of the major causes of withdrawal from ACE-inhibitor trials, are usually more frequently observed in women than in men <xref rid="pone.0111558-Mackay1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111558-Slater1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In our study, the incidence of cough, was similar between men and women treated with zofenopril, and ramipril, while it occurred more frequently in lisinopril-treated women, suggesting an intra-class difference. As far as zofenopril is regarded this confirms results of a previous pooled analysis in hypertensive patients, in which significantly more women than men experienced cough <xref rid="pone.0111558-Omboni1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In the same meta-analysis, a slightly lower occurrence of cough was reported under zofenopril as compared to enalapril or lisinopril <xref rid="pone.0111558-Omboni1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The incidence of angioedema, was low and similarly distributed in women and men, regardless of the type of ACE-inhibitor taken into account, suggesting no intra-class effect for this adverse drug reaction.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, although the design of the four SMILE studies was very similar, there were some differences in the inclusion criteria and treatment duration and follow-up which might have biased the study results, particularly when direct comparisons between different active drug treatments were made. Additionally, the primary endpoint used in this pooled analysis was not homogeneously shared among the four SMILE studies. The SMILE 1 and 4 studies primarily assessed the occurrence of death or major cardiovascular outcomes, while the SMILE-2 and 3 study evaluated the occurrence of severe hypotension and of cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction or need for revascularization procedure, respectively, though in such studies death and/or hospitalization were assessed as secondary outcomes. We attempted to adjust such differences by standardizing the different study endpoints in one homogeneous outcome and by taking into account possible confounding variables such as age, gender, major CV risk factors, duration of follow-up and study sample; we also used individual patients&#x02019; data instead of averages. Second, we must acknowledge that some gender differences in response to ACE-inhibition might be explained by an imbalance in the number of subjects among the various treatment groups. For instance, the fact that the risk reduction observed with zofenopril in comparison with other ACE-inhibitors was significant in men, but not in women, might be related to the fact that the number of zofenopril-treated individuals was larger than that treated with lisinopril or ramipril.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the pooled data analysis of the SMILE studies confirm that post-AMI women are at higher risk of CV complications than men, particularly when living in Mediterranean countries. Their response to ACE-inhibition varies according to the type of drug employed. The CV drug effects are usually better in men than in women.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0111558-Franconi1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
