Postoperative sore throat (POST) being the most undesirable symptom occurs in more than 50% of surgical patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Among the various methods of airway management such as the use of facial mask, laryngeal mask airways, and endotracheal tube (ETT), ETT is most frequently associated with such postoperative complications ranging from 30% to 70%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The cause of these morbidities could be either patient's bucking or coughing or friction between the tracheal mucosa or increase in ETT cuff pressure during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This has deleterious effects as it may increase intracranial, intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pressure, bronchospasm, wound dehiscence, bleeding, and laryngeal complication such as sore throat, hoarseness, or dysphonia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The ETT cuff pressure is most important factor which when elevated compromises of the blood supply of tracheal mucosa followed by serious morbidities such as ciliary loss, inflammation, ulceration, hemorrhage, tracheal stenosis, and trachea-esophageal fistula.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Maintenance of ideal cuff pressure during whole surgery is also challenging as many factors govern it like anesthetic gases such as N<sub>2</sub>O, agent used to fill the cuff, and material and type of cuff[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Most commonly used anesthetic gas N<sub>2</sub>O in conjunction with other gases frequently causes rise in intracuff pressure with the progression of surgery. N<sub>2</sub>O and oxygen readily diffuse in air-filled cavities such as ETT cuff leading to gradual rise in volume and cuff pressure of ETT. Consequently, this pressure change results in more severe form of POST.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Various literature in the past has proven the relation of rise in cuff pressure and volume with the usage of N<sub>2</sub>O. Intracuff use of saline and lignocaine is recently being reviewed for the effectiveness in preventing coughing, POST, and postoperative hoarseness (PH).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Lignocaine being liquid in nature not only inhibits the entry of N<sub>2</sub>O in the cuff but also permeates through semipermeable cuff membrane to tracheal mucosa and provides direct anesthetic effect. Alkalinization of lignocaine with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) increases the nonionized form of lignocaine which considerably increases the diffusion of lignocaine through polyvinyl cuff walls (63 folds).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Thus, lesser amount of lignocaine can provide rapid and prolong action over mucosa.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Hence, in our study, we have studied the effect and safety of use of intracuff alkalinized lignocaine over conventional air and evaluated incidence of coughing and POST after tracheal extubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a prospective randomized control study conducted in tertiary care teaching public hospital after obtaining ethical permission and well informed written consent from the patients.

Standard routine balanced general anesthesia was given as per the attending senior anesthesiologist's protocol and dosage according to the body weight of the patient. ETTs with high residual volume, low-pressure cuff, with an inner diameter of 7.0 mm for female and 8.5 mm for male were used in all patients.</p><p>Subjects were allocated in two groups as Air group (A) and Lignocaine group (L) according to computer-generated randomization sheet with fifty patients in each group.</p><p>In A group, ETT cuff was filled with air to prevent air leak during positive pressure ventilation guided with cuff manometer.

Care was taken to ensure that starting cuff pressure as approximately 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O adequate enough to just prevent leak around cuff during positive pressure ventilation. Volume and cuff pressure of air and lignocaine injected in the cuff was noted at start and end of surgery. Total duration of anesthesia was also noted.

(Cochrane 2009) concluded that topical and systemic lignocaine therapy reduces the prevalence and severity of sore throat after general anesthesia with ET intubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Recent meta-analysis by Lam <italic>et al</italic>. showed the beneficial effect of alkalinized and nonalkalinized lignocaine intracuff over conventional inflation medias. The incidence of early and late POST, agitation, coughing, hoarseness, dysphonia like post intubation emergence phenomena was significantly lower in lignocaine group.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>It was clearly evident that with the prolongation of duration of anesthesia cuff pressure also increased significantly in air group in comparison to lignocaine group [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>]. Similarly, the outcome of rise in cuff pressure in such patients whose duration of surgery was prolonged showed significant increase in coughing and POST in air group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. Furthermore, the analysis showed the increase in duration of anesthesia influenced the incidence of coughing and POST in lignocaine group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].</p><p>Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated linear rise in cuff pressure with time in air group. They suggested that the rise in cuff pressure causes tracheal mucosa ischemia due to lateral contact pressure exerted by cuff.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In our study, all the cases were extubated without any complication. The present study was not without limitations as we did not included children and elderly in our study subjects. Severity of coughing and sore throat were not graded rather only incidence of its presence was evaluated. Measurement of concentration of plasma lignocaine was not done.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In the setting of general anesthesia with the use of N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> mixture, rise in cuff pressure with the progression of surgery is better overcome when ETT cuff is inflated with lignocaine as compared to air. Alkalinized 2% lignocaine provides an improved protective effect in preventing postoperative laryngotracheal morbidity in form of coughing and POST. Duration of anesthesia is another risk factor, which has significant impact on increase in cuff pressure and consequently increased the incidence of coughing and POST in ETT cuff filled with air.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank Department of Surgery, Topiwala National Medical College and BYL Nair Ch.
