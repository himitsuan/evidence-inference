We investigated whether erlotinib improves clinical outcome in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>TOPICAL was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, done at 78 centres in the UK. Eligibility criteria were newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed NSCLC; stage IIIb or IV; chemotherapy naive; no symptomatic brain metastases; deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy because of poor (&#x02265;2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status or presence of several comorbidities, or both; and estimated life expectancy of at least 8 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned (by phone call, in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by disease stage, performance status, smoking history, and centre, block size 10) to receive oral placebo or erlotinib (150 mg per day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Investigators, clinicians, and patients were masked to assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were by intention to treat, and prespecified subgroup analyses included development of a rash due to erlotinib within 28 days of starting treatment. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 77383050.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between April 14, 2005, and April 1, 2009, we randomly assigned 350 patients to receive erlotinib and 320 to receive placebo. We followed up patients until March 31, 2011. 657 patients died; median overall survival did not differ between groups (erlotinib, 3&#x000b7;7 months, 95% CI 3&#x000b7;2&#x02013;4&#x000b7;2, <italic>vs</italic> placebo, 3&#x000b7;6 months, 3&#x000b7;2&#x02013;3&#x000b7;9; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0&#x000b7;94, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;81&#x02013;1&#x000b7;10, p=0&#x000b7;46). 59% (178 of 302) of patients assigned erlotinib and who were assessable at 1 month developed first-cycle rash, which was the only independent factor associated with overall survival. Patients with first-cycle rash had better overall survival (HR 0&#x000b7;76, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;63&#x02013;0&#x000b7;92, p=0&#x000b7;0058), compared with placebo. Compared with placebo, overall survival seemed to be worse in the group that did not develop first-cycle rash (1&#x000b7;30, 1&#x000b7;05&#x02013;1&#x000b7;61, p=0&#x000b7;017). Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea was more common with erlotinib than placebo (8% [28 of 334] <italic>vs</italic> 1% [four of 313], p=0&#x000b7;0001), as was high-grade rash (23% [79 of 334] <italic>vs</italic> 2% [five of 313], p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001); other adverse events were much the same between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Patients with NSCLC who are deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy could be given erlotinib. Patients who develop a first-cycle rash should continue to receive erlotinib, whereas those who do not have a rash after 28 days should discontinue erlotinib, because of the possibility of decreased survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Cancer Research UK, Roche.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer, the main cause of cancer-related death, accounts for nearly 1&#x000b7;4 million deaths worldwide every year, and has an annual incidence of more than 41&#x02008;000 in the UK (age standardised incidence of 48 per 100&#x02008;000).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Mortality from lung cancer accounts for more than 452&#x02008;000 deaths in China, 342&#x02008;000 in Europe, and 162&#x02008;000 in the USA.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The number of lung-cancer deaths in developing countries is expected to increase during the next few decades such that by 2030 about 70% of tobacco-related deaths will occur in these countries.

Such patients do not normally receive chemotherapy. Other inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, diagnosis within the past 62 days, able to take oral medication, and using effective contraception if appropriate. Exclusion criteria were previous treatment with any biological anticancer therapy; previous palliative radiotherapy (except to bone metastases, within the previous 2 weeks); pregnant or lactating women; evidence of significant laboratory finding or concurrent uncontrolled medical illness judged to potentially interfere with the trial treatment; and present treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor.

The dose could be reduced to 100 mg, then 50 mg in cases of substantial toxic effects. Treatment continued until disease progression, adverse side-effects judged by the treating clinician to warrant discontinuation, or patient withdrawal. Patients continued to receive active supportive care, including palliative radiotherapy, at the discretion of their clinician.</p><p>The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured from the date of randomisation until death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (time until progression or death from any cause), tumour response (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), adverse events, and quality of life. Patients who survived or who did not have progression were censored at the date they were last known to be alive.</p><p>Within 4 weeks before randomisation patients had a physical examination, assessment of comorbidities with the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), blood count and biochemistry, chest radiograph, and CT of the chest and abdomen. Clinicians did bone and brain scans when clinically indicated. Patients completed quality-of-life assessments (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C-30 and LC14, and EuroQol 5-dimensional scale) at baseline, monthly during the first year, then 18 and 24 months after randomisation. Presence of several comorbidities was defined as CCI of 3 or more.</p><p>Clinicians did physical examinations, including assessment of performance status, development of rash, and adverse events (with National Cancer Institute of Canada Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0), and a chest radiograph every month for the first 12 months, and every 2 months thereafter. We graded rash with the criteria: erythema alone (A), erythema with papules (B), erythema with papules and pustules (C), and erythema with papules and confluent pustules (D). CT scans were done at 3 and 6 months and when clinically indicated&#x02014;eg, after abnormal chest radiographs.</p><p>For translational research, we collected blood samples and diagnostic biopsy material (paraffin blocks) before starting treatment. Purification and assessment of quality and quantity of tumour DNA were done with Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

We used the maximum grade for each type of adverse event for each patient. We analysed quality of life with mixed effects models for repeated measures with baseline values as a covariate. We did model adequacy checks for continuous variables, including those for departures from normality assumptions, with residual plots and normal probability plots. We calculated compliance to study treatment by dividing the total number of tablets taken (equivalent to number of days on study drug) by the number of days from randomisation to death, progression, or when treatment was stopped early, and expressed results as a percentage.

Our randomisation procedure gave 936 cells and by chance the first allocation in each cell for several centres was erlotinib, producing an imbalance in the number randomised to each group; 350 participants were assigned to receive erlotinib and 320 placebo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). We followed up patients until March 31, 2011.

Compliance to study treatment (defined as patients who took their tablets for &#x02265;75% of the time that they were in the trial, until they died or stopped treatment early), was 58% (204 of 350) for erlotinib and 63% (203 of 320) for placebo (median compliance was 88% [IQR 0&#x02013;98] for erlotinib and 86% [0&#x02013;96] for placebo, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows that the main reasons for stopping trial treatment were toxic effects or disease progression.

Only 2% (12 of 670) of patients received a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (n=3) or chemotherapy (n=9) after disease progression, seven in the placebo group and five in the erlotinib group.

However, erlotinib did improve progression-free survival. Additionally, in prespecified subgroup analyses, compared with placebo, erlotinib significantly improved both overall survival and progression-free survival for patients who developed a first-cycle rash; median overall survival in this group increased by 2&#x000b7;1 months, from 4&#x000b7;1 months to 6&#x000b7;2 months. Multivariate analysis among patients assigned erlotinib confirmed that rash was the only significant predictor of overall survival. First-cycle rash has been studied elsewhere,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and in TOPICAL 95% of patients assigned erlotinib who developed rash did so within 28 days (much the same as 90% within 25 days in the BR.21 study<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>). Rash itself might be a predictive factor, irrespective of treatment. However, few patients assigned placebo developed first-cycle rash (5% compared with 59% assigned erlotinib), and we identified no difference in survival in patients assigned placebo who had rash compared with those who did not. Few patients were lost to follow-up because survival is short and patients with lung cancer in the UK are seen regularly and remain under the care of a hospital physician.</p><p>A limitation of our study was that the incidence of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation was only 7% and a quarter of them were uncommon mutations. Most <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation studies focus on so-called hot spot analysis, looking only for common alterations, short deletions in exon 19, or the 858Leu&#x02192;Arg point mutation in exon 21. Our population were mostly elderly, white, present or ex-smokers, and such groups might have a different mutation spectrum profile, which further studies could examine. Nevertheless, although analyses were based on only 28 patients, overall survival and progression-free survival were improved in patients with an <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation who were assigned erlotinib, consistent with gefitinib in patients with poor performance status.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> However, patients with tumours showing wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> also showed benefit when they developed an erlotinib-related rash. The BR.21<sup>6</sup> (second and third line treatment) and SATURN<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> trials (maintenance erlotinib after first-line chemotherapy), similarly reported that erlotinib was effective in predominantly good performance patients with wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> (though BR.21 included some patients with performance status 2&#x02013;3). We planned TOPICAL in 2002, and did not mandate compulsory tissue collection. In the IPASS study,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> only 56% (683) of patients provided samples with <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation data available in 36% (437) of the 1217 patients randomised. This proportion was much the same as in our trial where samples from 58% of patients had sufficient DNA for analysis.</p><p>Another limitation of our study is that we did routine CT scans at 3 and 6 months, whereas some other studies have used CT scans every 6&#x02013;8 weeks, so our schedule might be deemed suboptimum for assessment of progression-free survival. However, the monthly chest radiographs would trigger a CT scan before the protocol timelines, and overall survival was the primary trial endpoint. Also, we included patients of performance status 2, for whom, on the basis of evidence reported in 2005,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> chemotherapy could improve survival, and a phase 2 study<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> has shown that doublet chemotherapy has a better survival than single agent chemotherapy. However, when TOPICAL was designed, provision of chemotherapy to such patients was not routine practice because many studies with second and third generation chemotherapy had not shown survival benefit, and many of these patients had serious adverse events.<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,18</sup></xref> A limitation of many of the more recent chemotherapy trials is that median age of patients of performance status 2 is 65 years or younger, median survival is much the same as for patients of performance status 0&#x02013;1, and many go on to receive second-line treatment, suggesting that they are a highly selected group. By contrast, in TOPICAL median age was 77 years, 90% of participants had several comorbidities, and less than 2% were given second-line treatment, which is indicative of the real-world scenario that lung cancer is a disease of elderly people with comorbidities, and many of these patients still continue to be treated with best supportive care worldwide, including palliative radiotherapy.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p>When TOPICAL was designed some evidence already suggested that development of a rash during erlotinib therapy could be associated with improved outcomes across several cancers including NSCLC.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> With this knowledge, we developed a scoring system for rash as part of the TOPICAL protocol, and specified a preplanned subgroup analysis. Our phase 3 results confirm these early findings. Furthermore, retrospective analyses of two phase 3 NSCLC trials show a positive correlation between rash and treatment effect on survival: the BR.21 trial<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> of erlotinib and the FLEX trial<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> of cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, when added to first-line chemotherapy.

Future studies could examine whether combining erlotinib and immunomodulatory agents can further fuel a more robust immunological response, increase the severity and incidence of skin rash, and potentially further improve durability of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival in this group of patients who are deemed not suitable for chemotherapy.</p><p>A phase 2 study<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> of gefitinib (n=201) compared with placebo (INSTEP) in a group of patients with similar characteristics to those in TOPICAL showed no statistical difference in survival with a HR of 0&#x000b7;84 (95% CI 0&#x000b7;62&#x02013;1&#x000b7;15), but we identified a suggestion of a benefit among patients with high EGFR gene copy number determined by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (HR 0&#x000b7;44, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;17&#x02013;1&#x000b7;12). 34 of the 100 patients in the gefitinib group developed rash, and none with placebo, but the investigators did not analyse this finding. The dose of gefitinib might have been subtherapeutic in patients with wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> tumours, and this notion is supported by the lower than expected proportion who developed rash. Another phase 2 trial<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> of only patients of performance status 2 (n=103) with a median age of less than 70 years compared erlotinib with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and showed that progression-free survival was better with chemotherapy than with erlotinib but progression-free survival did not differ between patients assigned erlotinib who developed rash compared with those who were assigned chemotherapy (HR 0&#x000b7;94, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;56&#x02013;1&#x000b7;59). In TOPICAL, erlotinib seemed to have a greater effect in some subgroups than in others (eg, median overall survival was improved by 3&#x000b7;6 months for women with rash and 1&#x000b7;1 months for men with rash).

The reasons for this finding are unknown but for some of our patients (especially men and those with ECOG performance status of 3), the disease might be so advanced that any toxic treatment could accelerate deaths.

Erlotinib is expensive: a 30-day pack costs about &#x000a3;1650 in the UK ($4740 in the USA). Future analyses of TOPICAL will examine the cost effectiveness of various approaches, and compare quality adjusted life-years. Second and third line erlotinib is marginally cost-effective compared with best supportive care, therefore first-line erlotinib could be more cost-effective.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p><p><italic>EGFR</italic> testing has now become standard of care to select patients who are <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation-positive for treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

systematic review of scientific literature before designing the TOPICAL trial (in 2002), because at the time there were no other studies of first-line EGFR inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were elderly or had poor performance status. These patients are often excluded from first-line chemotherapy trials.</p><p>Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of elderly people, and elderly patients with advanced NSCLC deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy with poor performance status (2 and 3) or several comorbidities, or both, remain a major challenge. Since TOPICAL, no phase 3 trials of first-line monotherapy for this group have been reported.</p><p><bold>Interpretation</bold></p><p>The findings of TOPICAL and other trials<xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5&#x02013;8</sup></xref> show that erlotinib is an important treatment for patients with NSCLC in various clinical settings, including as maintenance after first-line chemotherapy, as second-line or third-line monotherapy in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC, and in chemotherapy-naive patients with activating <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. However, unlike the TOPICAL patients, most of the patients in other studies had good performance status.</p><p>The clinical implications of the TOPICAL trial are that patients who are deemed unsuitable for chemotherapy could be given erlotinib. Those who have <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation-positive tumours could receive continuous erlotinib; whereas those who have wild-type tumours should discontinue erlotinib after about 28 days if they do not develop a rash because of the possibility of decreased survival.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
