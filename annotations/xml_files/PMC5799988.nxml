This is due to the presence of plethora of microorganisms residing within the canal lumen, dentinal tubules, and anatomic complexities which cannot be accessed by the instruments or chemical agents alone.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The effective delivery of irrigants into the anatomic complexities can be enhanced using sonic and ultrasonic devices as well as apical negative-pressure irrigation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Ultrasonic activation of irrigant enhances its mechanical cleansing of canal due to cavitation and acoustic microstreaming.

Foscan is a second-generation PS derived from chlorophyll-a. The red light activation at 650 nm allows for greater photoactivation and deeper tissue penetration. It has also been shown to yield higher<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> at lower drug concentration and requires light doses as low as 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy in elimination of root canal flora when activated with both ultrasonics and light.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Determination of antibacterial concentration of photosensitizer dye</title><p>Foscan (CAT NO: 17333, Cayman Chemical Company, USA) is available as powder was mixed with solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (Finar Limited, India) to prepare stock solution of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of drug concentration.
