Firstly, the incidence of post craniotomy nausea and vomiting is relatively high (44-70%).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Secondly, in addition to causing fluid and electrolyte imbalances, emesis may precipitate an increase in intracranial and cerebral intravascular pressures, jeopardizing hemostasis and cerebral perfusion.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Thirdly, depressed airway reflexes in the immediate post-operative period due to residual effect of anesthetic drugs and involvement of lower cranial nerves augment the chances of pulmonary aspiration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Fourthly, the need for neurocognitive monitoring post-operatively makes use of sedating antiemetic undesirable in these patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Antiemetics are the main stay of prophylaxis against PONV.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Among them 5HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron and granisetron are considered first-line agents due to their high efficacy and fewer side-effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Granisetron as compared with ondansetron is a more selective and longer acting 5HT3 receptor antagonist; efficacy of which for PONV prophylaxis has been demonstrated after different surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We routinely use dexamethasone in neurosurgical patients as it reduces perilesional edema and have observed it to augment the antiemetic efficacy of 5HT3 antagonists.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, the relative efficacy of granisetron compared with the prototypical ondansetron has yet not been fully elucidated in patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial and infratentorial brain tumors. Thus, a prospective, randomized and double-blind clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of combination of dexamethasone with granisetron, ondansetron or normal saline (NS) for PONV prophylaxis until 48 h post craniotomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After institutional Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent, 75 American Society of Anesthesiologist &#x02013; I/II/III adult patients of either sex and scheduled for elective craniotomy for brain tumors were enrolled in the present study. Patients with Glasgow coma scale &#x0003c;14, not extubated at the end of surgery, on pre-operative antiemetic therapy, previous history of PONV/motion sickness/Gastro esophageal reflux disease and history of allergy to 5HT3 antagonists were excluded from the study.</p><p>A routine pre-anesthetic check-up was done for all patients with special reference to history of PONV, smoking and opioid use. Patients were pre-medicated with tablet (tab) ranitidine 150 mg and tab alprazolam 0.25 mg 2 h before surgery. In the operative room the entire standard monitors electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II, non-invasive blood pressure (BP), pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and capnography were established and baseline (pre-induction) measurements were recorded. Dexamethasone 8 mg was given to administered to all the patients at induction. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg and tracheal intubation facilitated with vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg. Lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg was given 90 s before intubation in order to obtund the hypertensive response to laryngosopy and intubation and subsequent rise in intracranial tension. Propofol 0.5 mg/kg was repeated just prior to intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (50%) and isoflurane in oxygen. Patients were given intermittent positive pressure ventilation to maintain end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) between 30 and 35 mmHg. Parameters monitored at appropriate intervals included heart rate (HR), BP, ETCO<sub>2</sub>, SpO<sub>2</sub>, central venous pressure (CVP) (where indicated) and urine output (UO). Fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenous (IV) was given initially and supplemented with fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg IV hourly. Analgesia was supplemented with infiltration of the incision site with 0.25% bupivacaine both at the start and the end of surgery and inj. diclofenac sodium intramuscular (IM) at dural closure. Mannitol 1 g/kg IV was transfused (over 15-20 min) at the start of surgery. Isotonic fluids were given as maintenance and replacement fluids. Colloids like Hydroxy ethyl starch and blood were given as per the losses. At the time of dura closure, patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups using envelope method to receive: Group G: Granisetron 1 mg IV, Group O: Ondansetron 1 mg IV or Group D: NS IV. Dexamethasone was given at induction and granisetron or ondansetron or NS at the time of dural closure. Study medications were prepared by an anesthetist not involved in PONV monitoring in identical 2 ml syringes.</p><p>Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg and trachea was extubated after signs of adequate neuromuscular reversal. Post-operatively patients were managed in the neurosurgical recovery room for the first 48 h and following parameters were monitored: ECG (L-II), BP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR, CVP (where indicated) and UO. Anesthetists who were blinded to group allocation recorded each episode of nausea, retching and vomiting. All patients were monitored for PONV for 48 h post-operatively after extubation. An episode of PONV was defined as nausea (subjective feeling of the need to vomit), vomiting (expulsion of stomach contents) or retching (an involuntary attempt to vomit but not productive of stomach contents). All episodes of nausea which were immediately followed by retching or vomiting were taken as an episode of retching or vomiting respectively. In case, the patient exhibited all the three symptoms within 1-2 min, it was taken as one episode of vomiting for statistical purposes. Patients who had only nausea (for more than 10 min) without retching or vomiting were taken as an episode of nausea. To calculate incidence of PONV and avoid duplication of results, a patient exhibiting a combination or all the symptoms was taken as one. Injection metoclopramide 10 mg IV was used as the rescue antiemetic (RAE) in the event of patient having nausea lasting more than 10 min duration or an episode of retching or vomiting. All patients were monitored for sedation and it was scored using the following sedation score Grade I - alert/oriented, Grade II - sedated but responsive to verbal commands and Grade III - sedated but responsive to physical stimulation. Degree of analgesia was noted by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and rescue analgesic diclofenac sodium 1 mg/kg IM was given 8 hourly and also when score was more than 3. Adverse effects like episodes of headache were also noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics in the form of mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentages have been calculated for interval and categorical variables, respectively.

Granisetron with dexamethasone was more effective in preventing PONV as compared to ondansetron but the results did not reach statistical significance. The incidence of PONV without prophylactic 5HT3 antagonists in our study was 56%, which is in accordance with the results of previous authors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Vomiting was the commonest PONV symptom observed in this study which is in accordance with the study results of Sinha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The incidence of nausea was comparable among the groups. Our results are similar to that of other authors and a Meta-analysis who have reported lower efficacy of 5HT3 antagonist for nausea.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Retching was highest in group D (16%) and least in group G (4%). Most of the studies on PONV in patients undergoing craniotomy have not commented on the incidence of retching as a separate symptom.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Post-operative retching is the most neglected PONV symptom, which by causing increase in arterial and intracranial pressure may cause major medical morbidity and therefore should be properly addressed in post craniotomy patients.</p><p>The 5HT3 antagonists are relatively recent group of antiemetics with few reported side effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] They do not produce sedation, extrapyramidal reactions or drug interactions with other anesthetic drugs. Most research on 5HT3 antagonists has been performed with ondansetron. The optimal dose range of Ondansetron to prevent PONV is 4-8 mg IV with duration of antiemetic effect being dose related.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However as the current authors used ondansetron with dexamethasone which owing to its long half-life (36-72 h) is effective against both early and late emesis,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] 4 mg was used as the study dose of ondanstron. Granisetron has a longer half-life of 8-9 h versus 3 h for ondansetron and therefore requires less frequent dosing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Granisetron 2 mg has been shown to have similar antiemetic efficacy as ondansetron 8-16 mg following cancer chemotherapy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Bhattacharya and Banerjee found granisetron 2 mg to be more effective than ondansetron 4 mg in preventing PONV following gynecological laparoscopy.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Granisetron 1 mg has been shown to provide adequate antiemetic prophylaxis after supratentorial craniotomy;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] 1 mg was chosen as the study dose of granisetron. With regard to timing, the 5HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone appear to be most effective when administered at the end of surgery and before the induction of anesthesia respectively.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A number of modifications in anesthetic technique such as restricting opioid use to fentanyl, using injection diclofenac and scalp infiltration with bupivacaine to supplement analgesia and propofol as the induction agent were used to reduce the basal incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] There is evidence that craniotomy is usually associated with mild pain and less analgesic requirement than other surgical procedures, as was observed in our study.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Although, Gan <italic>et al</italic>. recommended avoiding N<sub>2</sub>O and minimizing concentration of the volatile anesthetics in order to reduce PONV,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] we preferred using N<sub>2</sub>O in lower concentration (50:50) instead of avoiding it so that the concentration of volatile anesthetic agent used did not exceed the minimum alveolar concentration value. A study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>. found ondansetron and granisetron to be equally effective in preventing emesis following supratentorial craniotomy.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The present study also demonstrates that PONV was high but statistically insignificant in Group O (12%) compared with group G (4%) and was significantly increased in patients of group D (48%), compared with above two groups. We evaluated the antiemetic efficacy of the combination for 48 h post-operatively unlike most of the other authors who evaluated it only for first 24 h.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, we could not demonstrate any significant reduction in PONV beyond 24 h post craniotomy. This may be due to the fact that 5HT3 receptor antagonists are the most effective against early vomiting and dexamethasone against both early and late nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The incidence of PONV was found to higher than that of RAE requirement as PONV included all episodes of nausea, whereas RAE was administered only when nausea persisted more than 10 min.</p><p>The possible neurosurgical risk factors for PONV such as sex, smoking status, duration of anesthesia, site of lesion and post-operative pain were evaluated and found to be comparable among the groups, therefore not affecting the results.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Incidence of PONV was found to be significantly increased in patients who underwent surgery for the infratentorial tumors when compared to supratentorial tumors which is in accordance with the study results of Fabling <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This is in contrast to Kathirvel <italic>et al</italic>. who found the incidence of PONV to be comparable in supratentorial and infratentorial lesions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Fabling <italic>et al</italic>. have shown female patients to be more prone to PONV.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In the present study, a higher incidence of PONV was observed in female sex in Group D. However, it did not reach statistical significance. An extensive study with a larger sample size is required conclude more definitely on risk factors for PONV following craniotomy.</p><p>The three groups were comparable regarding the sedation scores and VAS scores throughout post-operative period. The higher sedation in the first post-operative hour can be explained by the residual effect of general anesthesia. Kathirvel <italic>et al</italic>. also did not observe excessive sedation after ondansetron treatment. However they did not quantify the level of sedation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Our study has some limitations. No control group was studied. Second, we did not compare combination of 5HT3 antagonists + dexamethasone with 5HT3 antagonists alone. Dexamethasone, in neurosurgical patients, reduces perilesional edema and is traditionally used in craniotomy. We therefore took group D as our control group. The intra operative use of nitrous oxide, isoflurane and dexamethasone could have influenced the baseline PONV incidence in our study. Future studies investigating administration of 5HT3 antagonist both at the start and end of surgery and combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods could be the strategies to further reduce PONV in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Combination regimen of granisetron or ondansetron in doses of 1 and 4 mg with dexamethasone respectively provide superior and effective antiemetic prophylaxis compared with Dexamethasone alone in adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy without producing any significant side-effects or affecting neurocognitive monitoring which is so essential in post-operative neurosurgical care. We recommend the prophylactic antiemetic combination of granisetron or ondansetron in doses of 1 and 4 mg respectively with dexamethasone for preventing post craniotomy PONV.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kathirvel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dash</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhatia</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shenoy</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of prophylactic ondansetron on postoperative nausea and vomiting after elective craniotomy</article-title><source>J Neurosurg Anesthesiol</source><year>2001</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>207</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11426094</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Neufeld</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Newburn-Cook</surname><given-names>CV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting after craniotomy: A meta-analysis</article-title><source>J Neurosurg Anesthesiol</source><year>2007</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17198095</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ambesh</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of ondansetron in prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients following infratentorial surgery: A placebo-controlled prospective double-blind study</article-title><source>J Neurosurg Anesthesiol</source><year>1999</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9890379</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Islam</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Post-operative nausea and vomiting: A review article</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2004</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>253</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fabling</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Guy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Borel</surname><given-names>CO</given-names></name><name><surname>el-Moalem</surname><given-names>HE</given-names></name><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative nausea and vomiting.
