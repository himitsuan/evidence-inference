Approximately one-half or more of patients with type 2 diabetes do not obtain an glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level lower than 7%[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and failure rate of 4% with metformin (MF) monotherapy has been recorded.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hence, the patients on MF monotherapy with inadequate response require combination therapy. The combination of MF and sulfonylureas is most commonly used in India because of its low cost and can attain a greater reduction in HbA1c than either drug alone.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, this combination therapy is prone to weight gain and severe hypoglycemia. VG is an oral and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which lacks these adverse event reports.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>There is a scarcity of research comparing the commonly used combinations of MF-glimepiride (MF-GP) and MF-vidagliptin (MF-VG) in clinical practice for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Furthermore, a recent ban in some part of world regulatory and flip flops policy adopted by Indian Drug regulating authorities on pioglitazone is expected to increase the use of gliptins.</p><p>Therefore, the current study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of combinations of MF-VG and MF-GP in T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A comparative randomized open-label trial was conducted for a period of 1 year commencing from November, 2012.
