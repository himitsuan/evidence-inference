Involvement in this process results in longer period of hospitalization for the newborn and in the long run makes the living conditions more difficult. Taking the multifactorial pathogenesis into account, approaches to tackle chronic lung disease (CLD) are mainly focused on interventions and prevention procedures. This study tries to investigate the potential capability of inhaled budesonide in the prevention of BPD in newborns with gestational age of &#x0003c;28 weeks with the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial done on seventy newborns with gestational ages of 23&#x02013;28 weeks with RDS in Isfahan Shahid Beheshti Educational Hospital from June 2014 to April 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups of intervention with budesonide and control. There were 35 newborns in each group.

Involvement in this disorder is accompanied by long hospitalization for the newborns and eventually results in difficulties to an extent that not only affects the quality of the newborn's life compared with that of a healthy one but also leads to later disorders and complications in the normal function of the respiratory system beyond childhood period, including decrease in lung function and limitations regarding sport activities, revealing an arrest in alveoli development in lungs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>It was first in 1967 that Northway applied the term BPD for the gradual development of a pulmonary disease in premature newborns that had experienced respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) upon birth. Northway <italic>et al</italic>. defined and categorized radiologic criteria for this pulmonary disease and attributed its development process to the exposure of a premature lung to oxygen and mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>BPD is in fact a diagnosis based on a series of pathologic evidence which can undoubtedly be attributed to mechanical ventilation and exposure to oxygen in a premature newborn's lung who is involved in RDS. Regarding gestational age and weight, this disease which is also referred to as chronic lung disease (CLD) entangles a significantly different population of the newborns than the one described by Northway four decades ago; at the moment, this disease is rarely observed in newborns weighing 1500&#x02013;2000 g. CLD occurrence among very premature newborns (severe BPD prevalence can be traced in 44% of newborns with 24 weeks of gestation and 20% of newborns with 27 weeks of gestation) is so highlighted these days that it is referred to as &#x0201c;new BPD&#x0201d;; currently, CLD is defined as the need for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days from birth.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Due to multifactorial nature of the pathogenesis of the diseases, approaches to tackle CLD mainly focus on prevention and interventional procedures. As mechanical ventilation, oxygen toxicity, infectious processes, and inflammation are considered as major factors in the etiology of CLD, a wide range of medicinal and nonmedicinal interventions has been proposed to treat BPD.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Caffeine, this methylxanthine is widely used to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP), as AOP occurs in at least 85% of newborns with gestational ages of &#x0003c;34 weeks.

In a meta-analysis done by Cochrane in 2002, it was revealed that long-term administration of Thiazides has improved the pulmonary function of newborns with RDS.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Bronchodilators</title><p>During BPD, due to hyperactivity and hypertrophy of smooth muscles, airway resistance increases.

Moreover, IV administration of N-acetylcysteine, as a forerunner for glutathione, in newborns with RDS weighing &#x0003c;1000 g has decreased the prevalence and severity of BPD. As Vitamins E and C act like scavengers against free oxygen radicals, they have also been proposed as a preventive means against BPD; anyway, the philosophy of administering antioxidants in premature newborns roots in the sensitivity of premature newborns&#x02019; tissues to preoxidation which results from exposure to high densities of inhaled oxygen and their limitations in the case of endogen scavengers.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Stem cells</title><p>As you know, stem cells divide into two categories of embryonic and somatic; in lung tissue, there are islands of somatic stem cells (adult stem cells [ASCs]) which have shown the capability to restore the damaged epithelium in the lungs.

Steroids, as an anti-inflammation, not only decrease the edema in the airways and thus prevent pulmonary fibrosis but also improve pulmonary function (gas exchange) through improvement in surfactant production, stabilization of capillary walls and prevention of capillary leakage, and finally improvement in &#x003b2;-adrenergic system.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Corticosteroid administration has been studied as an intervention to treat CLD as well as preventing BPD. Regarding prevention, the effect of corticosteroid administration has been investigated in several studies based on whether it is administered early (in the 1<sup>st</sup> week) or late (after 1 week).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Currently, there is an extensive research being done in European Union on the effect of inhaled budesonide on the prevention of BPD in newborns with RDS with gestational ages of &#x0003c;28 weeks. The mentioned study started under the title of Neonatal European Study of Inhaled Steroid by seven workgroups in the member countries of the European Union in 2009. Moreover, Cochrane foundation also published a review on the potential of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent BPD in very low-weight newborns in 2011, which in turn called for more extensive research in the field.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Due to the fact that the administration of inhaled corticosteroids as a means to prevent BPD is still regarded as an open research area by Cochrane, we decided to conduct a clinical trial to challenge the effect of inhaled budesonide on the prevention of CLD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a prospective randomized clinical trial done on newborns with gestational age of 23&#x02013;28 weeks involved in RDS at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Shahid Beheshti Educational Hospital (affiliate of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences) from June 2014 to March 2016. Thirty-five newborns were placed in the interventional group and were treated with inhaled budesonide while 35 other newborns were placed in the control group. To randomize the sampling, the newborns with even document numbers entered the interventional group (with inhaled budesonide) and the newborns with odd document numbers entered the control group and sampling continued until the required number of infants (<italic>n</italic> = 35) was achieved in both groups. The inclusion criteria included newborns who showed clinical symptoms of RDS within 2 h from birth (tachypnea, intercostal retraction, nasal flaring, grunting, and the need for supplementary oxygen) and thus received surfactant while under nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Consent form was filled for the newborns, and the newborns with congenital malformations or prenatal asphyxia (5 min Apgar score of 0&#x02013;3 and umbilical pH of &#x0003c;7 with umbilical bicarbonate of &#x0003c;12 mEq/L) were excluded from the study.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>At birth, the newborns were placed under nCPAP respiratory support with a T-piece (Infant T-Piece resuscitator-Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) and Argyle nasal prong (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland); with continuous distending pressure (CDP) set on 5&#x02013;6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, the newborns were transferred to nursery while covered in plastic.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In neonatal nursery, the newborns were placed under nCPAP with flow-driven continuous positive airway pressure system, including Medin prong interface and Medijet (Medin Innovations GmbH, Germany) injector; to maintain the current in the circuit and to enable the jet nebulizer capability, Christina (Stephan Medizintechnik, Dusseldorf, Germany) ventilator was used.
