We re-analysed the findings of a previously reported superiority trial of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy using the clinical study report obtained from Health Canada.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We re-analysed individual level data for a parallel arm randomized controlled trial that was conducted in six outpatient obstetrical practices in the United States. Pregnant women between 7 and 14 weeks of gestation with moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy symptoms. The active treatment was a tablet containing both doxylamine 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg taken between 2 and 4 times per day for 14 days depending on symptoms. The control was an identical placebo tablet taken using the same instructions. The primary outcome measure was improvement in nausea and vomiting of symptoms scores using the 13-point pregnancy unique quantification of emesis scale between baseline and 14 days using an ANCOVA. 140 participants were randomized into each group. Data for 131 active treatment participants and 125 control participants were analysed. On the final day of the trial, 101 active treatment participants and 86 control participants provided primary outcome measures.</p><p>There was greater improvement in symptoms scores with doxylamine-pyridoxine compared with placebo (0.73 points; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.25) when last observation carried forward imputation was used for missing data but the difference is not statistically significant using other approaches to missing data (e.g. 0.38; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.84 using complete data).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is a trend towards efficacy for nausea and vomiting symptoms with doxylamine-pyridoxine compared with placebo but the statistical significance of the difference depends on the method of handling missing data and the magnitude of the difference suggests that there is no clinically important benefit employing the prespecified minimal clinically important difference or &#x0201c;expected difference&#x0201d; of 3 points.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trial <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00614445">NCT00614445</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>NP was supported by a Physicians&#x02019; Services Incorporated Graham Farquharson Knowledge Translation Fellowship.

Our post-hoc longitudinal analyses indicate a small treatment effect favoring doxylamine-pyridoxine that is neither statistically significant (at the 0.05 alpha level) nor clinically important.</p><p>In both groups, the symptom scores improve substantially over the two weeks of the trial and plateau after day 10 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189978.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189978.g003">3</xref>). The difference between groups also decreases after day 10. Both of these findings could be explained by the natural history of the condition, that is, by the resolution of symptoms irrespective of treatment. This natural resolution could account for the lack of clinical important difference between groups.</p><p>The clinically important difference for this trial was 3 points on the 13-point PUQE symptom score based on the &#x0201c;expected difference&#x0201d; in the original protocol. The trial of ginger versus pyridoxine for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, that apparently was the basis for the sample size estimate, showed substantial improvements from baseline in both groups and no statistically significant difference between the ginger and pyridoxine groups on a 10-point visual analogue scale.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The sample size calculation for the trial of ginger versus pyridoxine was based on a clinically significant difference between groups of 25% (and an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20) which would roughly correspond to 3 units on the 13-point scale used here (25% of 13 = 3.25).</p><p>There are three studies that provide information about the clinical significance of different PUQE scores. A study of women calling a nausea and vomiting of pregnancy helpline categorized women having mild (4&#x02013;6 points), moderate (7&#x02013;12 points), or severe (13&#x02013;15 points) symptoms based on the 12-hour version of the PUQE score. These categorizations were associated with discontinuation of multivitamins, healthcare costs and global wellbeing ratings.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The mean PUQE score for women who visited an emergency room or who were hospitalized (11 &#x000b1; 3) was higher than for other women who called the helpline (9 &#x000b1; 2.2). A similar study involving the same recruitment method and categorizations but employing the 24-hour version of the PUQE score found associations with the discontinuation of multivitamins and liquid intake.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In a validation study of the Norwegian version of the PUQE score, women hospitalized with hyperemesis gravidarum (median 13; 95% CI 11&#x02013;14) had symptoms scores higher than women attending routine antenatal appointments (median 7; 95% CI 4&#x02013;8).[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The PUQE score was inversely correlated with nutritional intake.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In summary, the pre-specified statistical analysis plan described an &#x0201c;expected difference&#x0201d; between doxylamine-pyridoxine and placebo of 3 points on the PUQE score whereas the largest estimate of the difference is 0.73 (95% CI: 0.21 to 1.25). The expected difference of 3 points is consistent with the clinically significant difference of 25% (3.25 on the 13-point PUQE scale) described in the ginger vs. pyridoxine study.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This is also consistent with the differences in PUQE scores associated with differences in outcomes such as emergency room visits among groups of women in the validation studies such as emergency room visits, 2 points in one study and 5 in another.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Regardless of the analytical approach, the difference between groups was less than one point on the 13-point scale and there are no validation studies that indicate difference of this magnitude in this range of the scale (mild symptoms, one point above the minimum score) is clinically important.</p><p>The sample size calculation was apparently based on an alpha of 0.001 and an alpha of 0.05 is mentioned as the threshold for significance in the statistical analysis plan. Other values are provided in other sources (see Table F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189978.s001">S1 File</xref>). It is unclear why an alpha of 0.001 was used for the sample size calculation but an alpha of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. None of the analyses of the primary outcome indicate a p-value below 0.001 while some but not others are below 0.05. The large sample size was similar to that employed in an equivalence study of ginger and pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The results of this study might even be used to exclude the possibility that doxylamine-pyridoxine use provides a clinically important benefit over placebo. The large sample size in this trial provides informative results about the limited magnitude of effectiveness of doxylamine-pyridoxine. The maximum observed difference between drug treatment and placebo was 0.73 points (95% CI -1.25 to -0.21). The upper limit of this confidence interval, 1.25 points, suggests that a clinically important benefit is highly unlikely since 1.25 points is less than both the criterion originally specified in this trial (3 points) or the criterion used in the equivalence trial (2 points on a different 13-point scale).[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy outcomes were reported differently in the various publicly available documents related to this clinical trial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189978.t003">Table 3</xref>). The published articles report the results using the last observation carried forward imputation and not the sensitivity analyses, the global assessment of wellbeing is reported as a primary outcome when it was prespecified as a secondary outcome, some reported outcomes are described as secondary outcomes although they were not prespecified and some prespecified secondary outcomes were not reported.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Given the limited magnitude of effectiveness observed in this trial, it is worth examining why the FDA approved doxylamine-pyridoxine following this trial. The summary of the FDA review described the outcomes as they were prespecified and described the prespecified sensitivity analyses involving the per protocol and complete data groups as showing no statistically significant difference between doxylamine-pyridoxine and placebo for the primary efficacy outcome.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The FDA statistical reviewer performed an additional sensitivity analysis (using an unspecified statistical test) that found a statistically significant difference of 0.49 on the PUQE scale using the per protocol group (p = 0.044) but not the complete data group (difference of 0.36, p = 0.15).[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The trial sponsor responded to an FDA request by submitting the results of a &#x0201c;mixed model repeated measures analysis&#x0201d; with scores at all-time points (and apparently not just the end of study like the prespecified analysis) that found a statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.0002). The FDA also considered the post-hoc analysis of the number of participants who requested compassionate use after the study which favored doxylamine-pyridoxine but the FDA apparently did not consider the prespecified secondary outcome of the number of tablets taken during the study where there was no difference between groups. The only information available about the &#x0201c;mixed model repeated measures analysis&#x0201d; is the results provided in the FDA review summary. Ultimately the FDA approved doxylamine-pyridoxine based on this trial. The FDA statistical review concluded that there was &#x0201c;some evidence that Diclegis [doxylamine-pyridoxine] was effective&#x0201d; and the medical review accepted the p-value of 0.006 and the difference between groups of 0.73 from the last carried forward imputation. The FDA summary review indicated a &#x0201c;small, but statistically significant improvement&#x0201d; and noted that &#x0201c;although the treatment effect is small, there are no other FDA-approved treatments for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&#x0201d;.</p><p>Some secondary outcomes indicated a benefit of doxylamine-pyridoxine (e.g. time loss from employment, 0.92 &#x000b1; 3.86 versus 2.37 &#x000b1; 10.23 days, p = 0.064) while others indicated no difference between groups (e.g. time loss from household tasks). All PUQE subscores favored doxylamine-pyridoxine although the difference was not statistically significant; the difference between groups was smallest for nausea. The outcomes were reported differently in different publications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189978.t003">Table 3</xref>).[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>There was no important difference between groups in adverse outcomes even when previously unreported adverse events are considered.

In addition, we may have misinterpreted some aspects of the protocol or statistical analysis plan, our data extraction method could have introduced errors that were not detected (although several findings such as baseline characteristics were reproduced), and our re-analysis plan was developed only after we were aware of the trials reported findings. We were not allowed by Health Canada or the trial sponsor to make the underlying dataset publicly available so it will be challenging for others to reproduce the analysis.</p><p>There is no perfect method for dealing with missing data.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Last observation carried forward imputation is known to be problematic in general because it assumes data are missing completely at random. In this trial last observation carried forward imputation increased (or worsened) the symptom scores in the control group relative to the active treatment group because there was more missing data in the control arm and symptom scores decreased or improved in both groups during the study). We employed the prespecified sensitivity analyses including subsets of participants that disregard data from excluded participants. According to the clinical study report the purpose of the sensitivity analysis using complete data was &#x0201c;to examine the impact of missing data and data imputation, and hence to demonstrate that study conclusions are invariant to assumptions, the particular model, and methods of handling missing data.&#x0201d; This prespecified approach to missing data is reasonable in certain settings and not uncommon.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The prespecified sensitivity analysis showed that the findings depended on how missing data were handled. A review of the trial by Health Canada in 2016 cited methodological issues including problems with the sample size calculation, reporting of reasons for dropouts, the last observation carried forward imputation, and the properties of the symptom scale in concluding that &#x0201c;the results of the study are not definitive and consequently the interpretation of the DIC-301 study is problematic.&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>We also employed two longitudinal models that utilize data from participants with incomplete measurements. These longitudinal models are not necessarily any better than the prespecified approach or other approaches such as multiple imputation and inverse weighting.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189978.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The longitudinal models allow for imbalanced longitudinal data under specific assumptions; the linear mixed model assumes data are missing at random and the linear generalized estimating equation model assumes data are missing completely at random.[<xref rid="pone.0189978.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Other methods for handling missing data with different strengths and limitations might yield different results. Some methods may indicate a statistically significant treatment effect while others may not. Even if additional analyses are performed we believe that inferences regarding treatment would be the same, since the difference between groups would still depend on the &#x0201c;assumptions, the particular model, and methods of handling missing data&#x0201d; based on the different findings presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189978.t002">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec036"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This previously unpublished information about a trial of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy calls into question the conclusion of the original report that the medication is efficacious. For the primary outcome, none of the observed effect sizes exceeded the prespecified clinically important difference and inferences regarding the statistical significance of the treatment at a 5% alpha level are dependent on the handling of missing data. Clinical practice and guidelines should be updated.
