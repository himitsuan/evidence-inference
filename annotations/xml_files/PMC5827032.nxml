This study evaluates the impact of adding lobaplatin (L) to the TE regimen. Here, we show data from 125 patients (63 TE and 62 TEL patients). Four patients did not complete all the cycles. Two-sided <italic>P</italic> values show that the addition of L (38.7% vs. 12.7%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) significantly increases the rate of pCR in the breast and the axilla (TpCR) and the overall response rate (ORR; 93.5% vs. 73.0%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). The occurrence of grade 3&#x02013;4 anemia and thrombocytopenia is higher in the TEL group (52.5% vs. 10.0% and 34.4% vs. 1.7% respectively).

A worse prognosis has been reported in TNBC patients compared with hormone receptor or HER2-positive breast cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Endocrine therapy and HER2 molecular-targeted therapy do not appear to have benefits in TNBC patients, and adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended as a standard treatment for TNBC patients. A previous study reported that patients with TNBC have increased pCR rates compared with non-TNBC patients when given neoadjuvant chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Some meta-analyses have evaluated the impact of supplementing local therapy with chemotherapy for TNBC patients, and the results have shown that polychemotherapy leads to significant reductions in breast cancer recurrence and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy have a greater impact on the prognosis of TNBC than on hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</p><p id="Par4">The combination of docetaxel (T) and epirubicin (E) is a widely used treatment regimen. Through a phase III trial (ABCSG-24), Steger et al. confirmed the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TE for early breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. TNBC patients exhibit a higher risk of recurrence, equal to 10&#x02013;15% per year during the first several years after initial surgery, than hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients, who show recurrence rates of 3&#x02013;5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A new chemotherapeutic option, platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with TE, is currently being evaluated for TNBC.</p><p id="Par5">Platinum agents induce DNA-crosslinking events and subsequent apoptosis, leading to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Some studies of platinum-based neoadjuvant polychemotherapy have reported rates of pCR in the breast and axilla (TpCR) as high as 31%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, whereas other studies have shown that single-agent platinum therapy yields few pCRs (22%) in TNBC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Platinum-based compounds (cisplatin or carboplatin) are among the most widely used and effective agents. However, the administration of cisplatin is frequently limited by several severe toxicities, including gastrointestinal toxicity, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Although two randomized phase II neoadjuvant trials have confirmed that platinum-based (carboplatin) neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increases the pCR rates (53.2% vs. 36.9% and 60% vs. 44%, respectively) in TNBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, neither an increase in the rate of breast conservation nor long-term overall survival was reported, and several severe toxicities were detected. The identification of another platinum-based chemotherapy drug with reduced toxicity and a better therapeutic index is essential. Lobaplatin [1,2-diamminomethylcyclobutane-platinum (II) lactate] represents the third-generation platinum anticancer drugs, which show strong anticancer activity, low toxicity, and higher solubility and stability in water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The mechanism of action of lobaplatin is similar to that of other platinum-based compounds. In vitro experimental studies and a variety of preclinical tumor models have demonstrated that lobaplatin inhibits cell proliferation and shows promising anti-neoplastic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> due to the formation of DNA-drug adducts and influences on c-myc gene expression, which result in cell cycle arrest and changes in the expression of numerous proteins. In fact, lobaplatin has been shown to exert obvious effects in the treatment of various tumors in China. Deng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> indicated that the chemotherapy regimen of lobaplatin and pemetrexed is an effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients, but the doses of chemotherapy should be further modified. Another study of human non-small-cell lung cancer reported that the combination of lobaplatin with paclitaxel shows enhanced activity compared with cisplatin combined with paclitaxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Lobaplatin has also been shown to exhibit therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hepatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, with a total effective rate of 67.6%.</p><p id="Par6">It is currently unclear whether a regimen of neoadjuvant polychemotherapy with TE would benefit from the addition of lobaplatin to improve the pCR rate in TNBC patients. Here, we report a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to examine the impact of a TE+lobaplatin (TEL) regimen on the clinical treatment of TNBC in terms of TpCR, overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity. We show that the addition of lobaplatin significantly increases TpCR and ORR and that improvement in toxicities are observed after symptomatic treatment. These results demonstrate that the TEL neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen exhibits short-term efficacy with reversible side-effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p id="Par7">As Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows, 128 patients were enrolled in this study between January 2014 and February 2017.

A phase I clinical trial of increasing doses of lobaplatin showed dose-limiting toxicity in 10 patients with a dose of 35&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, but no adverse events were observed with 30&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. In addition, the therapeutic effect of combined agents is superior to that of single-agent chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Docetaxel and epirubicin are broad-spectrum antitumor drugs that can effectively treat a variety of malignant solid tumors. The doses selected to be administered were close to the median doses reported in a study that evaluated docetaxel dose in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and in a review of epirubicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In one phase III trial, the time to disease progression or overall survival with docetaxel doses ranging from 60 to 100&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> was similar for the adjuvant treatment of intention-to-treat patients with advanced breast cancer, while significant aggravation of hematologic toxicity occurred in the highest docetaxel dose group, with a 93.4% incidence of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, in an analysis of the FinHer trial data, there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients or the tumors, the numbers of distant recurrences or deaths between the groups receiving 80&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and 100&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of docetaxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. When the drug dosage increased, there was more myelotoxicity without necessarily a higher response rate. Hence, our clinical trial used a lobaplatin dose of 30&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> combined with docetaxel 75&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and epirubicin 80&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for TNBC patients.</p><p id="Par14">Increasing evidence has revealed that pCR is the most powerful predictive factor for the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and prognosis in TNBC patients. TNBC patients with known pCR have a better prognosis than those with residual tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Liedtke et al. noted that TNBC patients with pCR have excellent survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> published in Lancet in 2014 confirmed that patients with TNBC who achieved pCR demonstrated superior event-free survival (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18&#x02013;0.33) and overall survival (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11&#x02013;0.25) than those who did not achieve a pCR. Keam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> reported that the pCR rates in both the breast and the axillary lymph nodes for 47 TNBC patients who received docetaxel and doxorubicin combination therapy was 17%, and another study discerned that patients with locally advanced TNBC showed an unfavorable pCR rate in response to the combination of epirubicin and taxanes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Platinum-based chemotherapy has been proposed as another regimen for TNBC. Several studies have reported that the pCR rates of TNBC patients increased to 22% with the use of cisplatin alone as an adjuvant chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and this rate could reach 40&#x02013;67% through the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin with anthracycline or taxanes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our study is the first RCT showing that lobaplatin combined with docetaxel and epirubicin significantly improves the TpCR rate to 38.7% compared with non-lobaplatin-based chemotherapy. However, the pCR rate achieved in our study is lower than that reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. One possible reason for this discrepancy is the different cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy: we used a total of four cycles of chemotherapy every 3 weeks, whereas another study used eight preoperative weekly cycles.</p><p id="Par15">The ORR, including CR and PR, is another metric used to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The ORR can effectively reflect the sensitivity of chemotherapy agents and predict the patient&#x02019;s prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Deng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> reported that the ORR rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer who received lobaplatin was as low as 15.8%. In our study, the ORRs obtained with the TEL and TE regimens reached 93.5% (29CR&#x02009;+&#x02009;29PR) and 73.0% (20CR&#x02009;+&#x02009;26PR, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), respectively; these results are superior to those reported in the above-mentioned studies, possibly because TNBC is more sensitive to chemotherapy than other subtypes of breast cancer. Moreover, lobaplatin can significantly increase the ORR rate of TNBC.</p><p id="Par16">The evaluation and gradation of anticancer toxic drug reactions were based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Myelosuppression is the main toxicity of lobaplatin observed in previous trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and thrombocytopenia is the most common dose-limiting toxicity. In multiple clinical trials, the incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 thrombocytopenia ranged from 26.0&#x02013;72.7% with a dose of 50&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, whereas an incidence rate of 21.3&#x02013;31.8% was observed with a dose of 35&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, we considered the incidence of thrombocytopenia to be primarily associated with the lobaplatin dose, and the lobaplatin dose was reduced based on observations of thrombocytopenia. In the current study, the incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 thrombocytopenia in the lobaplatin-based chemotherapy group was significantly higher than that observed in the non-lobaplatin-based chemotherapy group (34.4% vs. 1.7%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and interleukin-11 treatment enabled a return to normal after thrombocytopenia in all but one patient, who stopped the treatment due to the toxicity. Moreover, leukopenia, neutropenia and anemia have also been reported in several clinical trials. Our study observed a higher incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 anemia in the TEL group (52.5%) compared with the TE group (10.0%), consistent with the early results of other studies (3&#x02013;12%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which suggests that severe myelosuppression is an effect of the TEL chemotherapy regimen. Myelosuppression might be a result of the cytotoxicity of lobaplatin or the interaction between lobaplatin and docetaxel. In addition, anemia was improved by treatment with erythrocyte growth factor, and no patients required red blood cell transfusions. Curiously, the incidence of leukopenia and neutropenia did not differ significantly between the two groups, which might be attributed to the prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Phlebitis, subcutaneous hemorrhage, digestive tract reaction, and hepatic and renal toxicity should be monitored during the administration of lobaplatin. In this study, one case of subcutaneous hemorrhage and one case of phlebitis were observed in the lobaplatin-based chemotherapy group, and significant improvement was observed after symptomatic treatment. Gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in both groups, with no significant difference between the groups. No obvious neurotoxicity or liver or kidney toxicity was observed in the two chemotherapy groups.</p><p id="Par17">In summary, our study suggests that the addition of lobaplatin to the docetaxel and epirubicin regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC significantly improves the TpCR rates and ORRs, with tolerable side effects; in addition, it can reduce recurrence and metastasis, at least in the short term. The TpCR rate can be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate short-term efficacy, but we do not currently have sufficient data to evaluate the long-term prognosis of TNBC patients. More analyses of follow-up information were limited by insufficient follow-up time. Subsequent results from ChiCTR-TRC-14005019 will be needed to determine whether the inclusion of lobaplatin leads to improvements in the long-term outcomes (the 5-year disease-free survival rate and 5-year overall survival rate) in TNBC and to identify molecular markers that profile treatment success.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="Par18">This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China, and was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on May 29, 2014 (Registration Number ChiCTR-TRC-14005019).

Pathologic CR in the breast was regarded as the complete disappearance of residual invasive disease with or without ductal carcinoma in situ by histopathologic examination. TpCR is one of the evaluation criteria for NACT. Moreover, treatment responses were evaluated according to the WHO Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors: CR: visible lesions completely disappear on ultrasound after four cycles of NACT; PR: tumor size is reduced by more than 50% after four cycles of NACT; stable disease (SD): tumor size is reduced by less than 50% or increased by no more than 25%; and progression of disease (PD): tumor size is increased by more than 25%, or new lesions are formed.
