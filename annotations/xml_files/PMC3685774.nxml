Experimentally induced magnesium deficiency in rodent models promoted an inflammatory response, characterized with increased plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen and a decrease in plasma albumin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In humans, low serum magnesium concentrations have been associated with high C-reactive protein (CRP)levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Several cross-sectional studies have reported inverse relationships between magnesium intake and some inflammatory markers, including high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) and IL-6.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] People with magnesium intake at any level below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) had a higher likelihood of elevated CRP, implicating that the RDA of magnesium may be an important risk threshold.

Little is known about the relationship between supplemental magnesium and inflammation. Because of limited data, it is unclear whether magnesium supplementation, as a simple and safe way to assure adequate magnesium intake, has the same effect as dietary magnesium intake on inflammation.</p><p>Therefore, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to investigate the effects of magnesium supplementation on serum magnesium, hs-CRP, plasma fibrinogen, and IL-6 in apparently healthy middle-aged women with BMI&#x02265;25, a group predisposed to chronic inflammation and adequate magnesium intake may have the most favorable effect on inflammation.

Exclusion criteria were diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal failure, liver and gastrointestinal disorders, infectious disease, asthma, thyroid and parathyroid disease, smoking and taking drugs including anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, magnesium-containing medications, laxative or hormonal products. None of participants had been taken any dietary supplements, at least for the two weeks prior to the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups using a random number table. The intervention group (<italic>n</italic>=37) received a tablet containing 250 mg magnesium in the form of magnesium oxide daily, while the controls (<italic>n</italic>=37) received a placebo for 8 weeks; the placebo had an identical appearance to the magnesium supplement, and contained corn starch, lactose, and stearic acid. The participants and all investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation, except an independent statistician who provided the randomization list. They were instructed to consume their pills once a day with lunch in order to reduce the risk of diarrhea and stomach upset. Subjects were contacted at 2 week intervals to assess safety and compliance, and had been asked not to change their usual diet, physical activity and to avoid taking any other dietary supplements during the study. Dietary intakes were assessed by a 24 h food recall completed for 2 days (1 week day and 1 weekend day) at entry and after 8 weeks of supplementation. The daily nutrient intakes, including energy, total fat, Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA), Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA), Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA), protein, carbohydrate, fiber, magnesium, selenium, zinc, Vitamins A, C, E, and B<sub>2</sub> were determined by Nutritionist 4 software (N-squared Computing, San Bruno, CA).

All tubes were centrifuged at 3000-4000 RPM for 10 min to separate serum and plasma. Serum magnesium was measured using the spectrophotometric method by an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 912; Roche Diagnostics). Serum hs-CRP values were measured using the immunoturbidimetric method (Pars Azmun, Iran) on the Hitachi 912. Plasma fibrinogen was determined using the Clauss method and IL-6 was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bender Medsystems, Vienna, Austria).

The association between serum magnesium and CRP has been investigated in few studies. Guerrero-Romero and Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Mor&#x000e1;n investigated 371 non-diabetic, non-hypertensive Mexican adults and reported a negative correlation between serum magnesium and CRP(r=&#x02212;0.39, <italic>P</italic>=0.002); after controlling for ages, sex, BMI, and glucose tolerance, elevated CRP was 2.11 times more likely in subjects with the lowest quintile of serum magnesium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] They also found a negative association between serum magnesium and hs-CRP in 488 healthy Mexican children, aged 10-13 years (r=&#x02212;0.708, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and the likelihood of elevated hs-CRP was 4.1 times higher in children with lowest serum magnesium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In 4497 Americans, aged 18-30 years, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the correlations between serum magnesium and other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen and IL-6 in addition to hs-CRP, and they also found an inverse correlation between serum magnesium and only hs-CRP, a finding in agreement with ours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Several cross-sectional studies have reported an inverse association between dietary magnesium intake and inflammation. Song <italic>et al</italic>., for the first time, investigating 11686 women&#x02265;45 years of age, showed that CRP concentration is 12% lower in the highest dietary magnesium intake quintile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In an analysis of 5773 adults, aged&#x02265;17 years, King <italic>et al</italic>. found their participants, who consumed less than the RDA recommendations for magnesium intake, were 1.48-1.75 times more likely to have elevated CRP (&#x02265;3 mg/L).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Chacko <italic>et al</italic>., in a 3713 multiethnic cohort of postmenopausal women, showed an inverse association between magnesium intake and IL-6, in addition to hs-CRP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Recently, in a longitudinal study of 4497 Americans, aged 18-30 years, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. found negative long-term associations between magnesium intake, hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and IL-6.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The contributions of total magnesium intake from supplements were small in those studies, so their findings support the beneficial effects from magnesium intake through its food sources. While dietary magnesium intake is highly correlated with other dietary nutrients including fiber, potassium, and folate, it is not clear that the associations observed are due to magnesium alone or from some other nutrient or combination of nutrients. It has also not determined whether increasing magnesium intake can reduce CRP and other inflammatory markers.</p><p>Inadequate magnesium intake commonly occurs in various populations. This nutritional problem was also highly prevalent among our participants, the dietary magnesium intake of 55.4% were lower than 50% of the RDA and about 93.2% consumed less than the American Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) of 265 mg/day. King <italic>et al</italic>., in a cross-sectional study of individuals with dietary magnesium intakes &#x02264;50 % RDA recommendations, and took magnesium supplements, found that the likelihood of elevated CRP levels were 22% lower than those not taking supplements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In the present study, we have examined whether 250 mg magnesium/day, in the form of magnesium oxide taken for 8 weeks, alter inflammatory markers in apparently healthy middle-aged overweight women.</p><p>After an 8-week supplementation, mean plasma fibrinogen attenuated significantly, by 9%, in magnesium group but this reduction did not reach significant compared to placebo group. It was indicated that the risk of myocardial infraction (MI) has been increased as much as 45% by a 1 g/L rise in plasma fibrinogen. Based on this estimation, the 29.3 mg/dL decrease in fibrinogen levels observed in our study can reduce the risk of MI by 12%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Serum hs-CRP reduced in both group significantly; hs-CRP concentrations at end of the study and their changes were not different between 2 groups. In contrast to hs-CRP and fibrinogen, IL-6 concentrations increased slightly in both group however no significant differences were observed between two groups in regard of IL-6 levels or their changes during the study.</p><p>In a clinical trial, Sarafian <italic>et al</italic>., found that 300 mg/day magnesium as magnesium citrate, given to heart failure patients for 5 weeks, significantly attenuated serum log CRP from 1.4&#x000b1;0.4 to 0.8&#x000b1;0.3 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Those patients demonstrated high serum CRP and low serum magnesium levels; however it was not tested whether the reduction in log CRP was significant compared to the magnesium untreated controls. In adults older than 51 years with poor quality sleep, 320 mg magnesium/day as magnesium citrate for 7 weeks decreased plasma CRP in participants with baseline values above 3 mg/dL.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Individuals with high inflammatory stress or low magnesium status might respond better and faster to magnesium supplementation. In our study, the dose administered and duration of magnesium supplementation may not be adequate enough to achieve the desired outcome; because of unavailability of related information on the direct anti-inflammatory effect of magnesium supplement, we cannot explain precisely why we saw no favorable effects for magnesium compared to the placebo.</p><p>Both the amounts and type of dietary fat can modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Dietary intakes showed that all types of dietary fats decreased in placebo group during the study in parallel with the reduction in the total amount of fat intake. At end of the study, SFA intake was significantly lower in placebo group compared to magnesium group. SFAs, especially palmitic acid, have been shown to promote inflammation indirectly by impairing the glucose and lipid metabolism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] An increase in IL-6 and fibrinogen followed by consuming a diet rich with stearic acid, a SFA with neutral effect on cholesterol levels, indicating that other mechanism may also be involved.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] These findings suggest that the changes in quantity and quality of dietary fat intakes, especially SFA, may cause for decline in hs-CRP and fibrinogen concentrations in placebo group.</p><p>The mechanisms through which magnesium affects inflammation are largely unknown; increased intracellular calcium due to magnesium deficiency is one of the proposed underlying mechanisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] In our study, percentage of fat declined significantly from 37.6&#x000b1;3.8 to 36.4&#x000b1;4.8% and fat mass from 26.4&#x000b1;5.2 to 25.4&#x000b1;5.5 kg in the magnesium group. No significant changes in physical activity levels and dietary intake during the study, raising the hypothesis that could magnesium supplementation has affected body composition? These modest changes in body composition may be important because of the relationship between fat mass and inflammatory markers which have been observed in both obese and non-obese individuals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] It is now recognized that adipose tissue secrete many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] and blood inflammatory markers are correlated with the degree of adiposity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Thus, it is possible that magnesium can reduce inflammatory markers by changing body fat mass along with the other proposed mechanisms. Limited cross-sectional studies have reported an inverse or no association between magnesium and adiposity as measured by BMI, waist circumference or percentage of body fat.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] Our finding provides direct evidence supporting the link between magnesium intake and body composition. Further research is needed to investigate the associations between magnesium and body composition.</p><p>In our study, 250 mg/day magnesium, administered as magnesium oxide for 8 weeks had no effect on serum magnesium in the magnesium group. However all previous studies do not report magnesium supplementation to cause consistent increases in serum magnesium levels; in some studies, it did increase, following magnesium supplementation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] while in others not,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] or even showed a decrease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] Vormann suggested that in adaptations to a wide variety of magnesium intakes, the total intake and excretion of magnesium remains in balance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] Lukaski and Nielsen have indicated that serum magnesium concentration has slight responses to changes in magnesium intake.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>] In addition, Song <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] and Dimai <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] have shown that serum magnesium fluctuated in a cyclic manner in response to magnesium supplementation, indicating that there is a time course of response to magnesium supplementation and that serum magnesium and supplemental magnesium intake do not have a linear trend. Therefore, it is clear that serum magnesium cannot be a sensitive indicator for magnesium intake despite frequent usage. In response to magnesium supplementation, the magnesium status of the participants at entry of the study may be also important. In certain cases, in whom magnesium supplementation increased serum magnesium, the participants were hypomagnesemic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] In our study, serum magnesium levels of participants were within normal range (1.8-2.6 mg/dL) at baseline.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has evaluated the effects of magnesium supplementation on several markers of inflammation. By excluding subjects with known factors affecting inflammation, we tried to examine the effect of magnesium on chronic subclinical inflammation, an important risk factor for age-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. We also investigated the effects of magnesium in middle-aged overweight women who are prone to chronic inflammation and age related diseases, a group in whom the associations between magnesium intake and inflammatory markers have been stronger and more pronounced.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>We had some limitations in this study. First, the duration of the study was short and the dose of magnesium administered was rather modest. Second, we did not determine the effect of magnesium supplementation on serum ionized magnesium or intracellular magnesium. Third, we determined treatment compliance by performing pill count, whereas urinary magnesium concentration was not measured to confirm it. Fourth, the kit applied to measure plasma IL-6 was not sensitive enough to indicate possible changes in its concentration in healthy subjects.</p><p>In summary, 250 mg/day magnesium administered for 8 weeks did not influence serum total magnesium, hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and IL-6, compared to placebo. Further clinical trials are required to examine the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation on inflammation. Some questions that remain to be answered are can magnesium supplementation consider as another way to reduce inflammation, which doses and for what durations would magnesium supplementation be effective and can magnesium intake affect body composition? Meanwhile, promoting intakes of magnesium near the RDA, especially through food sources, is prudent in order to reduce chronic diseases risk and improve health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to express our appreciation to the staff of Tehran University of Medical Sciences for their cooperation and participation in this study.
