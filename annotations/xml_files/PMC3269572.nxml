In surveillance for liver metastases, the primary imaging technique is computed tomography (CT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is also reported to perform well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, MRI due to its superior diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when evaluating liver lesions plays a major role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>To improve the detection and characterisation of lesions, a number of intravenous MRI contrast agents have been developed. Among these, two of the T1-shortening contrast agents have liver-specific characteristics: gadoxetic acid (Primovist&#x000ae;) and gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance&#x000ae;). These contrast agents have to be administered intravenously and contain gadolinium, which increases the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>A liver-specific contrast medium that is not administered intravenously and which does not contain gadolinium would be of great value for evaluating patients at high risk of liver metastases. A new contrast medium where the manganese is administered orally has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The uptake of manganese from the bowel is normally very limited, but can be facilitated when it is mixed with alanine and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. The manganese is then extracted from the blood circulation by the liver and is subsequently excreted with bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The high manganese uptake in the liver by the hepatocytes significantly decreases their T1 relaxation time, causing the liver parenchyma to appear bright on T1-weighted images. Non-functioning hepatocytes and metastases will not take up manganese and will therefore be of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this phase II trial was to evaluate whether the sensitivity of the new oral contrast medium to detect colorectal liver cancer metastases (CRLM) was comparable to that of a comprehensive intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine protocol. The secondary aim was to assess the safety and acceptability of this new agent (CMC-001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Population and standard of reference</title><p>Local ethics committee approval and informed patient consent were obtained for this open, randomised cross-over prospective study in which each patient constituted his/her own control. Twenty patients, 10 men and 10 women, aged 51&#x02013;79&#x000a0;years (mean 64&#x000a0;years) were recruited prospectively and consecutively. All patients had been referred to the multidisciplinary team for evaluation of 1&#x02013;6 suspected CRLMs before partial liver resection. The suspected metastases had been observed at contrast-enhanced CT in 17 patients and at MRI in 3 patients. In addition, nine of the patients had undergone a contrast-enhanced transabdominal ultrasound. At the final analysis (histopathology, additional imaging or follow-up) one or more metastases were found in 16 of the 20 patients; in 4 patients there were no metastases. In total, 44 metastases were identified (mean size: 19.5&#x000a0;mm, standard deviation: 15.6, size range: 3&#x02013;73&#x000a0;mm). Metastases were verified at histopathology after surgery (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25), at combined evaluation of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI by a consensus committee consisting of radiologists and surgeons at the multidisciplinary conference (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), contrast-enhanced ultrasound performed at least 3&#x000a0;months later (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), intra-operative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) or contrast-enhanced CT 3&#x000a0;months later (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). The absence of metastatic lesion in four patients was confirmed by histopathology in two, by combined evaluation of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI in one patient and, finally, by MDCT examination performed three months later in one patient. In these four patients, the suspected metastasis had been observed at CT in three patients and at gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI in one.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Imaging</title><p>Two MRI examinations were performed on each patient at an interval of 1&#x000a0;week; orally administered manganese-based contrast medium CMC-001 (manganese chloride tetrahydrate MnCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>, CMC Contrast, Lyngby, Denmark) or intravenously administered gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance&#x000ae;, Bracco, Milan, Italy) was used in random order, based on sealed envelopes.</p><p>The patients arrived at the MR unit early in the morning after one night of fasting. Imaging was performed at 1.5&#x000a0;T (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), combining the spine and the flexible body array coil before administration of contrast medium and either 3&#x000a0;h after oral ingestion of CMC-001 or after intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine using a 5-phase imaging protocol (unenhanced, arterioportal, portal venous, 5&#x000a0;min and 2&#x000a0;h), serving as our standard protocol in daily practice. The dose of CMC-001 was equivalent to 1.6&#x000a0;g MnCl<sub>2</sub> and was dissolved in 200&#x02013;400&#x000a0;mL of water. To facilitate its uptake, the manganese is combined with 1&#x000a0;g alanine and 1600&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. The dose of gadobenate dimeglumine was 0.1&#x000a0;mmol/kg.</p><p>For T1-weighted imaging, axial breath-hold 3D T1-weighted images [volumetric interpolated breath hold examination (VIBE), echo time (TE) 2.03&#x02013;2.09&#x000a0;ms, repetition time (TR) 4.05&#x02013;4.29&#x000a0;ms, field of view 40&#x000a0;cm and 120 1.8&#x000a0;mm thick slices] were obtained. For T2 imaging, 60 axial half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) images with an echo time (TE) 76&#x000a0;ms, repetition time (TR) 1000&#x000a0;ms, field of view 38&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;28.5&#x000a0;cm and 4&#x000a0;mm thick slices) were used. Total MR examination time for CMC-001 session was about 10&#x000a0;min each for pre- and post-contrast imaging.

In 10 patients, the CMC-enhanced examination was evaluated first; in the other 10, the comprehensive gadobenate dimeglumine examination was evaluated first. Irrespectively of order, the CMC-001 and the dimeglumine session were evaluated with an interval of at least 1&#x000a0;week. When evaluating CMC-enhanced images, both T1-weighted and T2-HASTE images were used. Criteria for the diagnosis of metastasis were low signal intensity at T1-weighted images and slightly high-signal intensity at T2-HASTE images. Criteria for classifying a lesion as non-metastatic (i.e. haemangioma or/and cyst) were low-signal intensity at T1-weighted images and markedly high-signal intensity at T2-HASTE images. When evaluating gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced images, the whole comprehensive protocol was used. Criteria for the diagnosis of liver metastasis were slightly hyperintense appearance in the T2-HASTE series, discrete peripheral rim contrast enhancement in the arterial and/or portal venous phases, and hypointense appearance in the liver-specific phase of the contrast enhanced series (2&#x000a0;h after administration of contrast medium). Criteria for the diagnosis of haemangioma were presence of discontinuous nodular peripheral enhancement following intravenous contrast agent administration and markedly high-signal intensity at T2-HASTE series. Criteria for the diagnosis of cyst were absence of enhancement following intravenous contrast agent administration and markedly high-signal intensity at T2-HASTE series. The number of metastases and their greatest diameter were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Image evaluation-quantitative analysis</title><p>The two participating radiologists (N.A. and T.B.) performed the quantitative analysis shortly after the lesion detection analysis was completed. There were two sets of unenhanced images of the liver: one before CMC-001 and one before gadobenate dimeglumine. For the calculations of lesion signal intensity before contrast-medium administration, the chronologically first of the two unenhanced series was used; for the calculations after contrast administration, only the hepatospecific phases were used (i.e. the T1-weighted image 3&#x000a0;h after ingestion of CMC-001 or the T1-weighted image 2&#x000a0;h after intravenous injection of gadobenate dimeglumine, respectively).</p><p>The signal intensity of the metastasis was obtained from a centrally placed circular ROI with half the diameter of the metastasis.

The high level of sensitivity concur with previously published studies on detection of liver metastases at MRI using intravenously administered mangafodipir trisodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and gadobenate dimeglumine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CRLM as small as 3&#x000a0;mm could be detected, regardless of which of the two liver-specific contrast agents was used. The novel contrast agent CMC-001 has, therefore, the potential to be used for surveillance of patients at high risk of liver metastases, distinguishing those cancer patients who need more extensive liver evaluation from those who do not. Such a group of patients are those with colorectal cancer. In this patient group liver metastases are present in up to 25% of the patients at the time of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and in up to 50% five years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients who have undergone &#x0201c;curative&#x0201d; liver surgery for colorectal cancer metastases have a high recurrence rate, more than 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hence, patients with CRLM require follow up imaging for many years, preferentially with a fast and sensitive method. However, further studies assessing the effectiveness of CMC-001 enhanced liver MRI as a surveillance tool are required. An advantage of CMC-001 is that it allows patients to self-administer the contrast agent orally 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h before the imaging acquisition session and obviating the need for intravenous injection.</p><p>There were 15 false&#x02013;positive results at the CMC-001 session compared with 2 false&#x02013;positive results at the gadobenate dimeglumine session. This higher false&#x02013;positive rate is a downside of CMC-001 compared to gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced liver MRI, where additional information about the contrast behavior of lesions is obtained at the dynamic phase after contrast injection, resulting in higher specificity. In clinical practice, this means that when lesions are detected at CMC-001 enhanced liver MRI, further evaluation by more specific techniques is necessary; once these lesions have been characterised, CMC-001 enhanced liver MRI should be highly accurate for detecting new lesions. CMC-001 should therefore be of special value in patients where repeated MRI exams are needed, i.e. in the surveillance situation. In the study setting, the radiologists were not allowed to evaluate previous examinations or patient history. This is a limitation of our study, because the number of false&#x02013;positive lesions has probably been overestimated.</p><p>When comparing the signal intensity of the liver parenchyma before and after contrast-medium administration, there was no difference in the signal increase after CMC-001 compared with that after gadobenate dimeglumine (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, the metastases did also show some grade of enhancement after gadobenate dimeglumine, but not after CMC-001. Thus, there was a significant increase in the metastasis-to-liver ratio after CMC-001, but not after gadobenate dimeglumine. In the present study, the sensitivity to detect CRLM on T1-weighted images without contrast media was low (61%), which is much lower compared with previously published data by Choi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with sensitivity of 86% before and 96% after gadobenate dimeglumine. One possible explanation for their greater sensitivity before contrast media were administered can be the fact that the readers in Choi&#x02019;s study also had access to T2-weighted images, while in our study readers evaluated only T1-weighted images at the unenhanced session. Interestingly, their sensitivity increased only to 87% when adding the dynamic phases after gadobenate dimeglumine injection (excluding the hepatobiliary phase), and the number of false&#x02013;positive lesions increased from 0 to 1. Furthermore, published data from Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] show that the hepatobiliary (one-hour delayed) phase had a better diagnostic performance than the dynamic phase imaging after gadobenate dimeglumine injection for the detection of liver metastases (sensitivity of 96% and 77%, respectively). These findings indicate that the hepatobiliary phase can play an important role in the evaluation of CRLM.</p><p>The dominant excretion of manganese via the hepatobiliary pathway makes it theoretically attractive for use in patients with impaired renal function. When measuring manganese levels in blood levels and urine in healthy volunteers after ingestion of CMC-001, no significant increase in manganese concentration was detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further safety studies are, however, needed before such recommendations can be issued.</p><p>There were no serious AE. All but one of the AE were considered by the investigator to be of mild or moderate intensity and no safety concerns were raised for any of the two products. The observed adverse events were related to the high ion-content resulting in gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea and nausea. We are therefore currently examining if lowering the dose of MnCl<sub>2</sub> tetrahydrate can result in fewer AE but with a sufficient diagnostic imaging quality. Apart from the gastrointestinal disorders, a limitation of using CMC-001 can be the inhomogeneous uptake in cases of low portal venous perfusion and/or of decreased liver function increasing the risk for suboptimal enhancement and diminishing lesion conspicuity (as is the case in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p>In our study, all patients were evaluated for liver surgery. Therefore, a majority of the metastases (25/44) could be verified at histopathology. However, the remaining 19 lesions were not considered resectable and therefore they lack histopathological verification. The final diagnosis of these had to rely on other imaging studies and on follow up. This is a limitation of our study and a factor for potential bias and overestimation of sensitivity. Additionally, our patient cohort, i.e. those with colorectal cancer and high risk of having liver metastases, comprise a highly selected study population, potentially also contributing to an overestimation of sensitivity. However, these limitations are considered to be of low impact in the present comparison with the comprehensive gadobenate dimeglumine protocol.</p><p>In conclusion, the sensitivity to detect colorectal cancer liver metastases at CMC-001 enhanced MRI is comparably high to that of a comprehensive intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine protocol; and it is safe, without serious adverse events.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>N.A. is a consultant for CMC Medical, the company who financed the clinical trial.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">The Royal College of Radiologists (2007) RCR Referral Guidelines: Making the best use of clinical radiology services (MBUR), 6th Edition.
