Both disinfection and debridement are largely dependent on irrigation protocol used and has long been considered as an essential adjunct to instrumentation. However, in recent years, its importance has grown considerably (Gulabivala <italic>et al</italic>. 2005, Zehnder 2006, and van der Sluis <italic>et al</italic>. 2007), in view of the finding that a significant part of the root canal wall is left untouched by contemporary instrumentation techniques (Peters <italic>et al</italic>. 2001 and Paque <italic>et al</italic>. 2010, 2011).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>During the use of endodontic instruments and irrigants, organic and inorganic debris, microorganisms, and irrigants may be extruded into the periradicular space causing postoperative inflammation, pain and a delay in healing. One of the most important complications related to or that occurs as a consequence of apical extrusion during root canal procedures is interappointment flare-ups and postoperative pain, which is an undesirable occurrence both for patients and clinicians (Tanalp and Gungor 2014).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, every effort should be made to reduce apical extrusion of infected debris so as to minimize postoperative reactions.</p><p>The type of root canal irrigation system and the design of irrigation needles may also affect the frequency and amount of apically extruded debris (Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>. 2011).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The conventional syringe irrigation is the basic technique for root canal irrigation, and the depth of needle tip placement in the canal is the most dominating factor for solution penetration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) first used by Weller <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in 1980, utilizes ultrasonic wave energy that is transmitted from a file or smooth oscillating wire to the irrigant.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Recently, a new irrigant delivery system has been introduced (EndoIrrigator Plus; Innovations Endo, Nasik, India) which is based on the concept of continuous warm activated irrigation and evacuation system (CWAIS). This system consists of an inbuilt suction and heater with controlled positive pressure and apical negative pressure tips which are to be used with warmed sodium hypochlorite at a temperature of 45&#x000b0;C&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The effects of EndoIrrigator Plus on apical extrusion of debris have not been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of conventional syringe, PUI and EndoIrrigator Plus on the amount of apically extruded debris.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty freshly extracted human mandibular premolars were selected. The inclusion criteria were single-rooted teeth with one root canal and one apical foramen with a mature closed apex. Radiographs were taken from buccolingual as well as mesiodistal directions for the evaluation of root morphology. Soft-tissue remnants and calculus on the external root surface were removed mechanically. Access cavities were prepared in each tooth and the canal patency was established with a size 15 flexile file (Mani Inc., Tochigi, Japan). The working length was determined by measuring the length of the initial instrument (size 15) at the apical foramen minus 1 mm. A single operator instrumented the canals of all specimens using flexile files up to apical size 40, using standard step back technique. Apical patency was maintained by passing a size 15 file to the working length after the use of each file.</p><p>Thirty teeth were then randomly divided into three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 10) as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group A (conventional syringe irrigation): Irrigant was applied with a syringe and a 30-gauge closed-end tip and side-port opening needle (Canal clean, Biodent, South Korea). After the use of each instrument, the irrigation needle was placed 1 mm short of the predetermined working length and the canals were irrigated using 1 ml of 3% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, and after the last instrument, 2 ml of sodium hypochlorite was used over a period of 2 min.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group B (PUI): The irrigation procedures in this group were performed using the same needle that was utilized in conventional syringe irrigation. After each irrigation, a Sonofile K-file ultrasonic tip (size 15, 0.02 taper) (Satelec, Acteon Group Dental, M&#x000e9;rignac, France) was placed 1 mm short of the working length and activated at a frequency cycle of 28&#x02013;32 Khz/s for 1 min, and after the last irrigation it was used for 2 min.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group C (EndoIrrigator Plus): Here, warm sodium hypochlorite heated to 50&#x000b0;C was placed into the canal with the help of controlled positive pressure tip up to middle one-third of the canal. The positive pressure tip was used between each instrument for 1 min, and the canals were irrigated and simultaneously evacuated. After the last instrument, apical negative pressure tip was used by placing it 1 mm short of the working length and the canals were irrigated using warm sodium hypochlorite and simultaneously evacuated for 2 min.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>In this study, a previously described experimental model by Myers and Montgomery in 1991 was used for debris collection [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Eppendorf tubes with their own stoppers were weighed with an electronic weighing machine (Mettler AJ100, Greifensee, Switzerland) which had an accuracy of 0.0001 g. Three consecutive weights were obtained for each tube, and the average measurement was taken to be its initial weight. Separate rubber stoppers were made for each Eppendorf tube which fitted tightly to its opening end and holes were created on these rubber stoppers. Teeth were inserted up to the cementoenamel junction and fixed to these rubber stoppers with cyanoacrylate and a 21-gauge needle, which was placed alongside the rubber stopper to equalize the internal and external air pressure. These set-ups were then placed into preweighed Eppendorf tubes, and the tubes were fitted into vials.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Debris collection apparatus</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-20-411-g001"/></fig><p>After the completion of instrumentation, each tooth with their corresponding rubber stoppers were removed from the Eppendorf tubes, and the debris adhering to the root surface was collected by washing the root surface with 1 ml of sodium hypochlorite in the Eppendorf tube. All root canal preparations were completed by one operator following which the Eppendorf tubes were numbered and a second examiner who was blind with respect to all experimental groups weighed the tubes.</p><p>The tubes were stored in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 days so as to evaporate the irrigant before weighing the dry debris. After the incubation period, the Eppendorf tubes with their stoppers were weighed three times using the same electronic weighing machine to obtain the final mean weight. The dry weight of the debris was calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty tube from that of the tube containing the extruded debris.</p><p>The data were then analysed using ANOVA and Tukey's multiple <italic>post hoc</italic> tests at a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.

Apical extrusion of infected debris to the periradicular space is possibly one of the principle causes of postendodontic treatment pain.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A study by Van de Visse and Brilliant (1975) to compare apical extrusion of debris in root canals with or without irrigation revealed that irrigation was a procedure that facilitated the extrusion of intracanal debris periapically and that instrumentation without irrigants resulted in no collectible debris.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Similarly, in the present study, three irrigation techniques were compared and the results revealed that they were all associated with apical extrusion of debris. However, as instrumentation alone cannot achieve complete elimination of bacteria and debris in all canals, effective irrigant delivery is a prerequisite for it.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Nowadays, the primary irrigant of choice is sodium hypochlorite (Zehnder 2006 and Dutner <italic>et al</italic>. 2012), mainly due to its unique tissue-dissolving capability (Moorer and Wasselink 1982, Zehnder <italic>et al</italic>. 2002, and Naenni <italic>et al</italic>. 2004) and strong antimicrobial effects, especially against biofilms (Arias-Moliz <italic>et al</italic>. 2009 and Bryce <italic>et al</italic>. 2009).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, sodium hypochlorite was used as an irrigant in this study. Furthermore, inadvertent extrusion of this caustic sodium hypochlorite can cause severe soft-tissue irritation and necrosis and can compromise the integrity of cancellous bone;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] therefore, its use should be restricted within the confines of the root canal system.</p><p>The EndoIrrigator Plus group extruded significantly less debris compared with the PUI and conventional syringe irrigation groups. It is based on the concept of CWAIS.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This device applies the principle of controlled positive pressure and apical negative pressure and supplies warm irrigant into the root canal system using single-use 30-gauge side-vented needles.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Here, controlled positive pressure is applied to the tip of the needle and simultaneously evacuated safely which may explain these results, as against irrigation with positive pressure which resulted in periapical extrusion (Myers and Montgomery 1991, Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 1995, Lambrianidis <italic>et al</italic>. 2001, and George and Walsh 2008).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Furthermore, its negative pressure tip sucks the irrigants placed into the pulp chamber down the root canal and back up again through the irrigation needle which may also explain these results. Using a similar design, Desai and Himel[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Gondim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that an apical negative pressure technique (EndoVac) resulted in less irrigant extrusion and reduced postoperative pain. Previously, EndoVac also showed less extrusion of debris when compared with sonic irrigation systems such as EndoActivator and Vibringe though not significant.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, PUI group extruded less debris than the conventional syringe irrigation group, and this finding is in accordance with the result of a previous study by Tambe <italic>et al</italic>. 2013.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Previous studies showed that side-vented needles extruded less debris when compared with the regular irrigating needle.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, closed-end tip and side-port opening needles were used for conventional syringe irrigation. Manual dynamic irrigation which uses a gutta-percha cone in short gentle strokes to activate the irrigant hydrodynamically was advocated by McGill <italic>et al</italic>. in 2008 to overcome the problem of apical extrusion of irrigant.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Therefore, further studies are needed to compare the efficacy of manual dynamic irrigation, EndoVac and other sonic irrigation systems such as Vibringe and EndoActivator with EndoIrrigator Plus system in reducing apical extrusion of debris.</p><p>In the present study, an experimental model previously described by Myers and Montgomery in 1991 was used for debris collection. Others like Hachmeister <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Altundasar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] suggested the use of foam, so as to simulate the back pressure provided by periapical tissues. However, this methodology has also been criticized as floral foam may absorb irrigant and debris while acting as a barrier.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The vital periapical tissues were not mimicked, so the results may not be same in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Therefore, it is not completely possible to extrapolate the results to the clinical situation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>
