The primary endpoint was the change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after 2 years.

In CKD patients, proteinuria and a decrease of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are risk factors for end-stage renal failure or cardiovascular disease (CVD). It has also been reported that the risk of adverse outcomes increases as the eGFR declines or as urinary protein excretion becomes higher [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Considering the suppression of proteinuria and preservation of renal function, first-line antihypertensive therapy for CKD patients with diabetes or proteinuria includes renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors.</p><p>However, polypharmacy is often needed in CKD patients to achieve the target blood pressure [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with calcium (Ca) antagonists and diuretics being recommended for combination therapy.

Patients who achieved the target blood pressure with perindopril at 4 mg/day were excluded from the main study.

Direct comparison between an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and an ACE inhibitor (ONTARGET trial) did not show any significant difference in terms of preventing the progression of renal failure associated with hypertension [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Adverse reactions are less frequent with ARBs than ACE inhibitors (e.g., dry cough induced by the bradykinin-potentiating effect of ACE inhibitors), but ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy with/without Ca antagonists to reduce the cost of treatment [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>RAS inhibitors are the main agents for suppressing the progression of renal dysfunction associated with diabetes or hypertension. Drugs in this class dilate the efferent glomerular arterioles by suppressing angiotensin II and reduce the glomerular pressure, which in turn decreases proteinuria and prevents a decline of GFR [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is important to lower the blood pressure and protect renal function by administration of RAS inhibitors at effective doses. However, these drugs tend to induce hyperkalemia or cause renal impairment, especially in patients with poor baseline renal function.</p><p>Ca antagonists are recommended for combination therapy with RAS inhibitors. These drugs are highly effective and economical, with no adverse effects on glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, or electrolytes. Ca antagonists are useful in hypertensive patients with renal dysfunction or diabetes, who are prone to develop electrolyte abnormalities [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In Japan, amlodipine (an L-type Ca antagonist) and benidipine (an L/T type Ca antagonist) are frequently used with the aim of also preventing vasospastic angina [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our present study suggested a renoprotective effect of benidipine compared to amlodipine in diabetic CKD patients with diabetes who had failed to respond to ACE inhibitor monotherapy. This result suggests that the efficacy of Ca antagonists for hypertensive patients with CKD or diabetes may be dependent on the Ca channel subtypes targeted by these drugs [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Ca antagonists target voltage-dependent calcium channels, which have several subunits with differing functions (classified as L-type, T-type, or N-type) that show different patterns of distribution in the kidney [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the renal microvasculature, L-type Ca channels are only expressed in the afferent arterioles and not in the efferent arterioles, while T-type and N-type Ca channels are found in both afferent and efferent arterioles and in the nerve terminals regulating these arterioles. Differences in the distribution of different types of Ca channels may have an influence on glomerular pressure [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Many Ca antagonists are in clinical use and may show differing effect on the Ca channel subtypes. Representative Ca antagonists like nifedipine and amlodipine only act on L-type Ca channels, while benidipine acts on T-type Ca channels in addition to L-type Ca channels [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>During progression of renal dysfunction, glomerular hypertension causes glomerulosclerosis, leading to an increase of proteinuria. L-type Ca antagonists may increase the glomerular pressure if the systemic blood pressure is not fully controlled, because L-type Ca channels are only expressed in the afferent arterioles. On the other hand, T-type Ca channels are expressed in both afferent and efferent arterioles. It has been reported that inhibition of T-type Ca channels dilates the afferent and efferent arterioles, alleviates glomerular hypertension [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and prevents proteinuria and deterioration of GFR.</p><p>Inhibition of T-type Ca channels may also suppress renal fibrosis, since one of the characteristic effects of L/T-type Ca antagonists is stronger suppression of aldosterone production than L-type Ca antagonists and aldosterone is involved in renal fibrosis due to its effects on the renal vasculature.</p><p>Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain the progression of diabetic nephropathy, including RAS activation [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase the plasma aldosterone level. In CKD patients with diabetes, enhanced local RAS activity also increases aldosterone production and leads to contraction of the afferent and efferent arterioles, resulting in chronic hypoxia and inflammation in the kidney, as well as glomerular hypertension and angiopathy with exacerbation of renal dysfunction [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>T-type Ca channels are expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, which is the site of aldosterone production, and it was reported that L/T type Ca antagonists suppress aldosterone production. L-type Ca antagonists may increase proteinuria, while T-type Ca antagonists may show a renoprotective effect in diabetic patients due to anti-inflammatory activity and prevention of renal fibrosis by suppressing aldosterone production [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Rho kinase may have a role in the mechanism by which benidipine suppresses the progression of renal dysfunction. Diabetic rats show increased Rho activity in the adrenal gland and enhanced urinary albumin excretion, which is suppressed by administration of a Rho kinase inhibitor. Activation of Rho/Rho kinase in renal tissue induces overexpression of factors that promote fibrosis and progression of nephropathy [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In diabetes, the kidney is affected by chronic hypoxia and non-oxidative energy metabolism becomes predominant. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF1&#x003b1;) plays a central role in metabolism under hypoxic conditions. An increase of HIF1&#x003b1; worsens renal impairment, while inhibition of Rho kinase facilitates degradation of HIF1&#x003b1; and suppresses the progression of renal dysfunction [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In a rat model of diabetes, glomerular expression of Rho kinase is increased and benidipine reduces Rho kinase expression similar to Rho kinase inhibitors. Diabetic rats also show increased expression of Rock 1 mRNA, with Rho kinase inhibitors and benidipine suppressing its expression. Accordingly, benidipine may suppress Rho kinase activation and progression of diabetic nephropathy [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we used an ACE inhibitor as basal therapy. Strict control of blood pressure is important in patients with diabetes and addition of a Ca antagonist is useful to achieve the target blood pressure. Dose escalation of the Ca antagonist rather than the RAS inhibitor may be a treatment option for poor blood pressure control, because Ca antagonists have a renoprotective effect while RAS inhibitors can worsen renal function or cause hyperkalemia.</p><p>Benidipine blocks the T-type Ca channel, lowers the glomerular pressure, and suppresses aldosterone production, making it suitable for treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Use of benidipine should be recommended for diabetic patients, because it is expected to show a superior organ-protective effect over amlodipine (and other L-type Ca antagonists) in addition to its antihypertensive effect.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The effects on renal function of the Ca antagonists amlodipine and benidipine were prospectively compared in hypertensive patients with CKD when these drugs were administered concomitantly with the ACE inhibitor perindopril. The primary endpoint (eGFR) showed no change in either group. However, among the patients with diabetes, eGFR decreased significantly in the amlodipine group, but did not change in the benidipine group.</p><p>This study showed that concomitant administration of an ACE inhibitor and benidipine (a T/L type Ca antagonist) in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy may suppress deterioration of renal function compared to use of an ACE inhibitor and amlodipine (an L type Ca antagonist). These results suggest a renoprotective effect of benidipine in CKD patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Limitations</title><p>The CHAT-BP study was performed in patients with relatively mild hypertension and the number of subjects analyzed was not large. In addition, we did not investigate the influence of different doses of benidipine or amlodipine, which may have biased the findings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of Chikushi-JRN for recruiting patients to the study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The authors have received financial support from Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bakris</surname><given-names>GL</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dworkin</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Toto</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuttle</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al</etal><article-title>Preserving renal function in adults with hypertension and diabetes: a consensus approach.
