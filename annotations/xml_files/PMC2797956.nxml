Indeed, the incidence of hypoglycemia increases when glucose control approaches normal glucose levels (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For this reason the development of an &#x0201c;artificial pancreas&#x0201d; has been a goal for &#x0003e;30 years (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>An artificial &#x003b2;-cell requires three elements: a continuous insulin delivery device, a continuous glucose monitoring system, and a control algorithm linking insulin delivery to glucose measurements (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The recent development of better performing continuous glucose sensors renewed the potential feasibility of closed-loop insulin delivery (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Short-term initiatives in the clinical research setting were reported in recent years but showed some limitations (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Key limiting factors were, first, delays in the modulation of insulin action related to subcutaneous infusion and, second, time lags in glucose detection due to either the placement of the sensors in the interstitial compartment of subcutaneous tissue or the internal structure of implanted intravenous sensors (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To reduce glucose deviations at mealtimes, a hybrid option of closed-loop insulin delivery includes a manual priming bolus (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Reported benefits of intraperitoneal insulin infusion from implantable pumps include fast insulin action and low basal plasma insulin levels, resulting in tight glucose control and a low incidence of hypoglycemic events (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The feasibility of automated closed-loop insulin delivery from implantable pumps has been demonstrated in clinical trials performed with the Long-Term Sensor System, which coupled these devices with an intravenous glucose sensor (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Our approach to optimize closed-loop glucose control includes the use of closer to physiological intraperitoneal insulin delivery, subcutaneous glucose sensing, and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm with a manual premeal bolus, resulting in a hybrid PID (HyPID) system. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of such an approach. We investigated patients in the same controlled hospital setting while testing the HyPID system and when following their usual self-management. This approach marks a difference from the previously reported closed-loop trials, which considered home-use periods for comparison with in-clinic closed-loop studies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Eight patients with type 1 diabetes, treated by an implanted pump using intraperitoneal delivery (model MMT-2007D; Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA) and infusing U-400 regular insulin (Insuplant; sanofi-aventis, Paris, France) for at least 3 months, were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were the following: age 18&#x02013;70 years, insulin delivery within 15% of expected accuracy for the 60 days preceding the trial, plasma anti-insulin antibody level &#x0003c;30% according to a radioimmunoassay of free and total anti-insulin antibody using a technique adapted from that of Palmer et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), written informed consent, and health insurance coverage by the French Social Security System. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breast feeding, plasma creatinine &#x0003e;150 &#x003bc;mol/l, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase above twice the highest limit of the normal range, total blood Hb &#x0003c;12 g/dl, any cardiovascular event during the last 6 months, any evolving ischemic or proliferative diabetic retinopathy on eye fundus examination for the previous year, and any known or suspected allergy to glucose sensor components.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the regional ethics committee Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud Mediterran&#x000e9;e IV, Montpellier, France, on 11 September 2007. The study was authorized by Agence Fran&#x000e7;aise de S&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; Sanitaire des Produits de Sant&#x000e9; on 29 November 2007 and registered under the reference number 2007-A00696-47 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afssaps.sante.fr">www.afssaps.sante.fr</ext-link>).</p><p>Subjects were admitted to the hospital for a total of 86 h, which was divided into a preparation phase (14 h), a control (open-loop) phase (24 h), and a closed-loop phase (48 h). The order of the control and closed-loop phases was randomized.</p><p>At admission (day 1, 1800), two subcutaneous glucose sensors (Medtronic Diabetes), similar to those used in Medtronic's CGMS and Guardian RT systems, were inserted in the abdominal area and were calibrated against a capillary blood glucose (CBG) value 2 h after insertion and then every 4 h. The second sensor was used as a backup in case the first sensor failed to track glucose. At 2000, patients were instructed to program their insulin bolus for dinner and to remain fasting until the following morning. On day 2, 20 min before the 800 experiment start, an intravenous catheter was placed in an antecubital vein for frequent blood sampling. Blood samples were then drawn (for later blood glucose and plasma insulin measurements) every 20 min at the start of each meal for a period of 2 h (800&#x02013;1000, 1300&#x02013;1500, and 1900&#x02013;2100, considered as &#x0201c;early postprandial periods&#x0201d; for breakfast including 40 g carbohydrate and lunch and dinner both including 70 g carbohydrate), every hour from 800 to 2200 except for early postprandial periods, and every 2 h from 2200 to 800 (considered as &#x0201c;nonpostprandial periods&#x0201d;).</p><p>During the 24-h control phase, the patients were instructed to monitor their diabetes by seven CBG tests performed before and 2 h after each meal and at bedtime and to program their pump according to the self-monitoring data. Sensor glucose data were monitored in real time and were patient blinded.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Glucose control and plasma insulin levels during closed-loop and control phases in eight type 1 diabetic patients treated by implanted insulin pumps and monitored by a subcutaneous glucose sensor</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="2" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Whole period<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Nonpostprandial period<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Early postprandial period<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Closed-loop</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Closed-loop</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Closed-loop</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% CI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood glucose (mmol/l)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.6 &#x000b1;

The computer receives sensor data using a radiofrequency protocol and sends commands to the pump using the Bluetooth protocol. A modified personal pump communicator, set up to receive commands from a Bluetooth adapter, was used instead of the personal pump communicator used by the patient. The pump was then set to the minimum allowed basal infusion rate of 0.2 unit/h, with the algorithm delivering discrete 0.2-unit boluses as calculated based on real-time sensor glucose measurements.</p><p>The mathematical algorithm used to calculate the insulin delivery rate is based on a model of the multiphasic insulin response of a &#x003b2;-cell (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The first version of this algorithm was described in Steil et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

Interestingly, time spent in the near-normal glucose range is increased in comparison with that for open-loop use of this insulin therapy based on self-monitoring data and patient initiative in the same environmental conditions.</p><p>The improved glucose control obtained during the closed-loop phases represents a valuable improvement for patients whose glucose was already well controlled as indicated by their initial A1C levels of 6.8 &#x000b1; 1.0%, because it was achieved with minimal patient interaction with the system. The assessment of closed-loop effectiveness, measured by percentage of time spent in the tight near-normal glucose range, illustrates the usefulness of sensor- and algorithm-driven insulin infusion. Because hyperglycemic excursions have been associated with oxidative stress (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and hypoglycemic deviations impair quality of life and can promote hypoglycemia unawareness, leading to the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), an important goal for a closed-loop system is to reduce glucose deviations. In addition, reduced interpatient variability of glucose levels also merits notice. This result is valuable in terms of reproducibility and safety of the algorithm.</p><p>The main benefit on glucose control during closed-loop phases was observed in time periods excluding the early postprandial (2-h) periods. Improvement of glucose control during these periods appears to be driven mainly by higher plasma insulin levels obtained by algorithm-driven insulin delivery. The trend to a quicker return to premeal glucose levels in the late postprandial periods, i.e., &#x0003e;2 h after meals, can be highlighted. However, despite the manual delivery of a premeal bolus during closed-loop phases, the early postprandial period remains a challenging situation that also was not solved in previously reported closed-loop experiments (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Programming a manual bolus before meals did not seem to be as effective in our study as in a recent trial using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Of note, in our experiments, postprandial insulin peaks were lower and later during closed-loop versus control phases. Reproduction of the dynamics of the physiological first phase of insulin secretion would require reaching higher acute plasma insulin levels corresponding both to the &#x0201c;cephalic phase&#x0201d; of insulin secretion and to the &#x0201c;incretin-promoted&#x0201d; component (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Future clinical trials should evaluate the amount and timing of the manual premeal bolus to better mimic physiology. From an algorithmic consideration, we can speculate that insulin action resulting from the premeal bolus may mask the appearance of glucose, therefore delaying the increase in the insulin delivery rate by the algorithm.</p><p>Blood glucose could be maintained between 3.85 and 10 mmol/l for 85% of the time in a recently reported 24-h closed-loop trial performed on eight adolescent type 1 diabetic patients in a hospital setting by combining subcutaneous insulin infusion, subcutaneous sensing, and a PID algorithm, the two latter elements being very similar to ours, except that insulin feedback was included in our algorithm (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Glucose control was maintained in the same range only 58% of the time in the open-loop phase performed in the home environment. Our data show that blood glucose was kept between 4.4 and 10 mmol/l for 76.5% of the time in 48-h closed-loop phases, which was also significantly better than in the open-loop phases during which glucose was kept in the same range for 63.7% of the time. The evaluation of the open-loop period in the same hospital setting has, however, a stronger value for comparison. The large between-patient variability of glucose control, during performance of the closed-loop trial using subcutaneous insulin delivery reported by the authors, may represent a significant difference with our data obtained by intraperitoneal infusion (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This difference in terms of blood glucose variability may be partially due to differences between these two routes of insulin delivery, which has already been reported in previous studies assessing implantable insulin pumps (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Hypoglycemia is a worrisome situation in closed-loop insulin delivery. In our study, hypoglycemic deviations occurred in a limited percentage of time, which was not significantly different from that in the control phase. This observation argues for the safety of the algorithm used. Moreover, because all hypoglycemic events were either detected by the patients from suggestive symptoms and/or immediately identified by the sensor, we may expect that a low-glucose warning system based on the sensor signal would be sufficient to prevent severe hypoglycemia in patients using the closed-loop algorithm at home.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and benefits on glucose control of a new alternative for closed-loop control. The reduced between-patient variability in glucose control is also worth noting. Although currently limited to a few patients in whom subcutaneous insulin delivery was considered unreliable, implanted devices for intraperitoneal insulin infusion have been shown to provide additional benefits in terms of quality of life (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Further development is needed to improve early postprandial glucose control, requiring premeal manual intervention for bolus programming in agreement with previous trials (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
