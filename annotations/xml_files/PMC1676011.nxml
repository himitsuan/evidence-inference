However, the suggested benefits of dietary supplementation for immune function in healthy well nourished subjects is less clear. Among the food constituents frequently associated with beneficial effects on immune function are micronutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, &#x003b2;-carotene and zinc, and colostrum. This study was designed to investigate the effects these ingredients on immune function markers in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomized, parallel, 2*2, placebo-controlled intervention study one hundred thirty-eight healthy volunteers aged 40&#x02013;80 y (average 57 &#x000b1; 10 y) received one of the following treatments: (1) bovine colostrum concentrate 1.2 g/d (equivalent to ~500 mg/d immunoglobulins), (2) micronutrient mix of 288 mg vitamin E, 375 mg vitamin C, 12 mg &#x003b2;-carotene and 15 mg zinc/day, (3) combination of colostrum and micronutrient mix, or (4) placebo. Several immune function parameters were assessed after 6 and 10 weeks. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Groups were combined to test micronutrient treatment versus no micronutrient treatment, and colostrum treatment versus no colostrum treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, consumption of the micronutrient mix significantly enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Adjusted covariance analysis showed a positive association between DTH and age. Separate analysis of younger and older age groups indicated that it was the older population that benefited from micronutrient consumption. The other immune function parameters including responses to systemic tetanus and oral typhoid vaccination, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte subset distribution were neither affected by the consumption of micronutrients nor by the consumption of bovine colostrum concentrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Consumption of bovine colostrum had no effect on any of the immune parameters assessed. The micronutrient mix enhanced cellular immunity as measured by DTH, with an increased effect by incremental age, but did not affect any of the other immune parameters measured. Although correlations between decreased DTH and enhanced risk of certain infection have been reported, it remains unclear whether and enhanced DTH response actually improves immune defense. The present data suggests that improvement of immune parameters in a population with a generally good immune and nutritional status is limited and that improvement of immune function in this population may be difficult.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Supplementation of nutritional deficiencies helps to restore immune function and contributes to increased resistance to infections in malnourished subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The literature is less clear however, on the suggested benefits of dietary supplementation for immune function in healthy well nourished subjects without overt signs of compromised immune function. Still, there is strong interest among consumers for food products that can help optimize their immune system and numerous products claiming this, are on the market. Among the food constituents frequently associated with beneficial effects on immune function are micronutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, &#x003b2;-carotene and zinc, and also the first milk produced after parturition (colostrum).</p><p>Studies suggest that vitamin C may enhance immune functions such as phagocytosis, neutrophil chemotaxis and lymphocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but contrasting findings have also been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin E has been shown to enhance antibody responses to hepatitis B- and tetanus vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and to increase delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in healthy elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], &#x003b2;-carotene can affect immune function after conversion to vitamin A, but also influences immune activity beyond its pro-vitamin A activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The most consistent findings of &#x003b2;-carotene activity on immune function are enhanced NK cell activity and TNF-&#x003b1; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Supplementation with 15&#x02013;25 mg zinc per day in elderly people showed no improvement of the DTH response, lymphocyte proliferation or NK cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Higher doses (&#x0003e; 100 mg/day) may improve certain immune aspects in elderly, although some findings are controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Colostrum contains high concentrations of natural immunoglobulins (mainly IgG) that can bind and neutralize pathogens in the intestinal tract, bactericidal factors such as lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and lysozyme, and growth factors and cytokines that may improve immune defense and gut-barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, data to substantiate suggested benefits of natural colostrum are limited. Natural bovine colostrum has been shown to stimulate <italic>in vitro </italic>phagocytic activity of leukocytes from cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consumption of 100 ml colostrum daily for 7 days by volunteers that were orally vaccinated to S.typhi, resulted in more volunteers with a high number of specific IgA secreting cells, although the average number of specific antibody secreting cells was not increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The current study was designed to investigate the efficacy of commercially viable- and "realistically-to-consume amounts" of bovine colostrum concentrate (Proventra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and a mix of micronutrients (vitamins E &#x00026; C, &#x003b2;-carotene and zinc) on immune function in healthy immuno-competent subjects aged 40&#x02013;80 y. Using a complete 2*2 factorial design, subjects were supplemented with bovine colostrum, a mixture of the micronutrients, a combination of bovine colostrum and micronutrients, or a placebo, for 10 weeks. A range of immunological markers was measured, which were identified as relevant for assessing immune function and comprised aspects of innate and adaptive immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These included the response to tetanus and (oral) typhoid vaccination, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte subset distribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>This study was conducted from September to December 2001 at the Unilever Food &#x00026; Health Research Institute, Vlaardingen, The Netherlands, after approval by the Medical Ethical Committee of Unilever R&#x00026;D Vlaardingen. At an oral briefing 394 interested candidates completed a questionnaire, resulting in 110 rejections based on exclusion criteria and 21 withdrawals. Two hundred and sixty-three subjects were invited for physical examination. One hundred seventy seven subjects were found eligible. Two subjects withdrew and 35 were excluded by lot. The remaining 140 subjects were randomized to the treatments. Three subjects withdrew after randomization but before the start of the study. One subject was replaced. Finally, one hundred and thirty-eight subjects entered the study. Subjects were healthy, non-smoking, males and females 40&#x02013;80 y of age, with average Dutch dietary habits, BMI &#x02265; 18,0 &#x0003c; 32,0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, normal clinical chemistry, tetanus antibody titers &#x0003c; 700 IU/L, and plasma vitamin E levels &#x02264; 40 &#x003bc;mol/L. Exclusion criteria were: known diseases, medication affecting immune function and/or intestinal flora, lactose intolerance, high IgE titers to bovine milk or prior typhus vaccination. Subjects were allocated to one of four treatment groups, stratified for gender and randomized for age, basal plasma vitamin E concentrations and titer of tetanus antibodies.</p><p>Using a complete 2*2 factorial design, subjects received: (1) control product (2) product containing 1.2 g/d bovine colostrum concentrate (equivalent to ~430 mg IgG), (3) a product containing a mix of micronutrients or (4) a product containing both the bovine colostrum concentrate and the micronutrient mix. The active ingredients were supplied in single serving sachets containing powdered drinks based on skim milk powder, sugar and maltrodextrin. Other ingredients were citric acid, lecithin, colorant and flavoring. The levels of active ingredients are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Bovine colostrum concentrate (Proventra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was obtained from GalaGen Inc.(Minnetonka MN) as a spray dried sterile filterable powder from the whey fraction of non-specific bovine colostrum. The formulation was developed at the Unilever Health Institute and produced at Budelpack Hamont N.V./S.A. (Hamont-Achel, Belgium). Participants were asked to consume one serving of water-soluble powder dissolved in a glass of water (100 ml) at breakfast and one at dinner. The control and test products were supplied to the participants (pre-portioned in 20 g amounts in two flavors) every 2 weeks. Compliance to dietary restrictions and test product consumption was evaluated at 2 week intervals using a questionnaire.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of study products<sup>1</sup>.

In this study 200 mg d, l-&#x003b1;-tocopherol increased the antibody response to tetanus toxoid vaccine 1.7-fold (<italic>P </italic>= 0.04). From these data the variance of the natural log was calculated to be 0.8. It is estimated that a difference of 1.5 would indicate a significant increase in antibody titers. In a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design (with A and B as factors), 35 volunteers per group (70 per level of A or B) would be sufficient to detect a 1.53-fold increase in response to tetanus toxoid vaccine (power of 0.8, alpha = 0.05). Therefore, a total of 140 subjects were recruited.</p><p>Data were analyzed by analysis of variance with colostrum treatment, micronutrient treatment, cohorts and gender as factors. As in none of the tested parameters a significant interaction between colostrum and micronutrient treatment was found, groups were combined to test micronutrient treatment versus no micronutrient treatment, and colostrum treatment versus no colostrum treatment. Occasionally individual datapoints were missing due to laboratory error or missing samples. The correct numbers on which statistical analyses were based are provided with the corresponding datasets.</p><p>Results are presented as least square means (LSM) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the four treatment groups. The p-values of the statistical analyses are based on the combination of the groups (2*2 factorial design). A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. The distributions of the response to vaccination (TT IgG and Ty21a IgG and IgA) were skewed, therefore, natural logarithm-transformed values for these variables were used for statistical testing. The delta compared to the baseline values of these parameters was expressed as a factor.</p><p>Covariance-analysis, adjusted for age, gender, treatment, cohort and interaction terms between age and treatments was used to evaluate the association between age and immune parameters. To show the effect of age, we subdivided the group in two age groups, using the median age of 56 years as cut-off point. All analysis were performed using the SAS statistical package version 8.2 (SAS institute, NC, US).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Composition of test products</title><p>The average amounts of active ingredients were comparable between the individual batches, were higher than the target levels and remained stable over the time course of the study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline characteristics, randomization, and compliance</title><p>Four subjects dropped out of the study for reasons unrelated to the intervention.

Separate analyses of older versus younger subjects, demonstrated that both DTH parameters, i.e. number of positive responses and diameter of indurations, were significantly enhanced in the older population, whereas this effect was not observed in the younger population.</p><p>The evidence for a positive effect of micronutrient supplementation on DTH seems to be consistent. Other studies have demonstrated an increase in the DTH response of elderly after micronutrient supplementation, especially by vitamin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also &#x003b2;-carotene, although in higher doses, has been described to have stimulating effects on DTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>How and if an enhanced DTH response relates to improved resistance remains to be elucidated. Studies suggest a correlation between a low DTH score and risk of e.g. diarrhoeal disease in Kenyan children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] septic-related deaths in surgical patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] pneumonia in elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and progression to AIDS in HIV positive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, despite the more or less consistent observation that vitamin E improves the DTH response, conflicting reports were published on the effect of vitamin E on resistance to respiratory infections. One study showed that consumption of 200 mg vitamin E daily for 15 months does not improve resistance to acute respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In fact, it was shown that the severity of respiratory tract infection was worse in vitamin E supplemented groups, as well as the duration of the symptoms. A second study by Meydani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] reported a protective effect of 200 IU daily of vitamin E for 1 year on upper respiratory tract infections, especially the common cold. How these observations correlate with respect to enhanced DTH after vitamin E suppletion remains elusive. Accumulation of vitamin E in tissues may account for detrimental effects of vitamin E and vitamin-E associated enhanced immune reactivity could either account for worsening of symptoms or improvement of resistance to certain infections. Alternatively, the DTH reaction may be an immunological parameter that is not associated with resistance to respiratory infections.</p><p>The absence of positive effects of the micronutrient mix on other immune parameters or of the colostrum preparation on all parameters examined, may largely be explained by the generally good health and nutritional status of the subjects. This is illustrated by the fact that successful immune enhancement is generally achieved in populations with suboptimal immune function such as elderly and athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, in elderly that retain a good nutritional status, decline in immne fucntion is not apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In our study population the average baseline concentrations of plasma vitamin E, vitamin C and &#x003b2;-carotene as well as the post-intervention vitamin E and C levels were comparable to what has been described in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and are indicative for a generally well-nourished population. The observed 900% rise in plasma &#x003b2;-carotene, which is higher than reported increases of 300&#x02013;600% in other studies using similar doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], may be explained by the fact that the test products contained the emulsifier lecithin in a molar ratio of ~70 relative to &#x000df;-carotene. Emulsifiers and fat from the formulation can help form micelles, which are required for absorption of carotenoids during lipolysis, thereby improving the bioavailabilty of lipophilic molecules such as &#x000df;-carotene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Also in the older subpopulation a lower nutritional status can not explain the observed benefit, since baseline micronutrient concentrations were higher (vitamin E) or similar (vitamin C and &#x02203;-carotene) in the subjects older than 56 years compared to the younger subjects (29.1 &#x000b1; 7.6 umol/L vs 25.1 &#x000b1; 6.2 umol/L, P = 0.0012 for vitamin E). Similarly, the size of the increase in micronutrient levels did not seem to correlate with the effect on the DTH since increases were similar in both populations.</p><p>Despite a few publications indicating the stimulatory effect of colostrum on phagocytic activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], which we confirmed with human leukocytes (data not shown), daily consumption of 1.2 g of bovine colostrum concentrate by volunteers in the current study did not affect ex-vivo phagocytic activity. Similarly, none of the other investigated immune parameters were significantly influenced by colostrum consumption, although the response to tetanus vaccination tended to be somewhat higher (p = 0.14).</p><p>Three studies have reported effects on immune function and resistance to infections after consumption of natural colostrum (enhanced response to oral typhoid vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], reduced number of URTI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and increased salivary IgA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]). However, the doses of colostrum used in these studies were up to 60 g/day. These high doses may be feasible in the context of severe physical exercise for which some of these studies were designed or for clinical nutrition, but for daily consumption by healthy consumers only lower doses would be economically feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Low daily doses of bovine colostrum do not improve a series of immune function parameters in healthy volunteers. Micronutrient suppletion of vitamins E &#x00026; C, &#x000df;-carotene and zinc positively affect the DTH response, especially in elderly subjects. How this may relate to improved resistance remains to be elucidated. Improvement of other immune parameters in individuals with a generally good immune and nutritional status may be difficult and it may take individuals with (moderately) impaired immune function to benefit from this type of nutritional intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors are employed by Unilever who financed the study and publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DW, ML, RvdW and RA contributed to the study design.
