Over nine months follow-up in our original study, there was no evidence that FFM ME-TRAP provided protection against malaria. The incidence of malaria was slightly higher in children who received FFM ME-TRAP, but this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.5, 95&#x00025; CI 1.0-2.3). Although the study was unblinded, another nine months follow-up was planned to monitor the incidence of malaria and other serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>405 children aged 1&#x02013;6 yrs were initially randomized to vaccination with either FFM ME-TRAP or control (rabies vaccine). 380 children were still available for follow-up after the first nine months. Children were seen weekly and whenever they were unwell for nine months monitoring. The axillary temperature was measured, and blood films taken when febrile. The primary analysis was time to parasitaemia &#x0003e;2,500/&#x000b5;l. During the second nine months monitoring, 49 events met the primary endpoint (febrile malaria with parasites &#x0003e;2,500/&#x000b5;l) in the Intention To Treat (ITT) group. 23 events occurred among the 189 children in the FFM ME-TRAP group, and 26 among the 194 children in the control group. In the full 18 months of monitoring, there were 63 events in the FFM ME-TRAP group and 60 in the control group (HR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.2, CI 0.84-1.73, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.35).

Briefly, two sequential FP9 ME-TRAP vaccinations (5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> plaque forming units) followed by MVA ME-TRAP vaccination (1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units), given intradermally. The control was rabies vaccine (Aventis Pasteur, WISTAR strain), administered according to the same timings. Rabies was also given intradermally, at 0.25 IU.

Briefly, the investigators in Kenya enrolled children, and applied study numbers sequentially. A list of eligible children was ordered according to age and village, and matched to the list of randomization card numbers, generated in the UK.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Blinding</title><p>The nurses who administered vaccinations did not take part in any other trial related procedure, and were subsequently based in Kilifi District Hospital rather than the trial site. They drew up vaccinations according to the instructions in the randomisation envelope, and documented the vaccination in notes that were not available to the investigators until after unblinding</p><p>After the first 9 months monitoring the primary analysis was conducted. A cleaned, locked database was transmitted to the DSMB, and the statistician then transmitted the allocation code to the lead investigator, who then implemented the analysis plan. It was planned to conduct a further analysis of episodes of malaria after a further 9 months monitoring, despite having unblinded the trial. The results (no significant efficacy) were fed back to the study participants, and a strong view was expressed that study participants wished to be told which vaccines children had received. This was done. Continued monitoring was supervised by a second investigator, and the lead investigator played no further part in assessment of malaria episodes or collection of data. The second investigator did not have details of vaccination allocation, neither did the laboratory staff who read blood films. Data was cleaned by the second investigator before being locked, following which analysis was conducted by the lead investigator.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The analysis plan was approved by the DSMB. The primary analysis was a log rank test comparing the time to the first or only episode of malaria (defined as fever with parasitaemia above 2500/&#x000b5;L) between the vaccination groups, stratified by age group, ITN (insecticide treated net) use and village, analysed by Intention To Treat. The hazard ratio and 95&#x00025; confidence interval was estimated by Cox's regression adjusted for the same covariates. Age group was a categorical variable with three levels (1&#x02013;2 years old, 2&#x02013;5 years old, 5&#x02013;6 years old). Village had 5 levels. ITN use was defined as sleeping under a treated net every night, which had less than three holes into which a finger could comfortably fit.</p><p>Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio taking into account all malaria episodes, adjusted for the same covariates. A period of 28 days after each malaria episode was deducted from the person time at risk, since individuals were assumed not to be at risk of malaria during this period. No further analysis is planned.</p><p>In order to assess interactions, data from each individual was split according to monitoring period. An interaction between vaccination and time of monitoring (first 9 months vs second 9 months) was then assessed for poisson regression and for survival analysis. Models with this interaction were compared with models without an interaction term using the likelihood ratio test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant flow</title><p>405 children were randomized in May 2005, and 383 were still available for follow up after the first 9 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000707-g001">Figure 1</xref>). 333 completed the second 9 months follow up.</p><fig id="pone-0000707-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000707.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Trial Profile.</title><p>After screening for eligibility, parents were invited to bring their children back to the dispensary for immunisation.

Furthermore, these data were acquired after the study had been unblinded. Measures were taken to reduce the impact of this on the integrity of the study; an investigator not involved in the primary analysis oversaw the second 9 months of monitoring, and blood films were read in the laboratory with reference to only study subject numbers without knowledge of vaccination group. The lead investigator who had conducted the primary analysis was not involved in continued follow up, and conducted the analysis presented here after being sent a cleaned database. That no efficacy was seen on the primary analysis was communicated to study participants, and so vaccine allocation was perhaps unlikely to bias health seeking behaviour. A similar number of follow up visits were completed among children allocated to either vaccination (4,958 visits among FFM ME-TRAP vaccinees vs 5,130 among controls), and a similar number presented for assessment of fever between visits (1,086 among FFM ME-TRAP vaccinees vs 1,095 among controls), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.58). Nevertheless, a subtle impact on health seeking behaviour cannot be excluded, and our findings here must be treated with appropriate caution.</p><p>Borderline significance on log likelihood testing for interactions between monitoring period and vaccination was seen. However, this was one of multiple analyses for interactions. The other 3 tests yielded less significant findings, and the study was no longer blind. There is insufficient evidence to conclude there might have been an interaction between vaccination and time (i.e. the effect, or lack of effect, of vaccination was constant throughout the duration of the study). This suggests that the variations in hazard during the monitoring period probably represent chance alone.</p><p>After the primary analysis of this trial we considered the formal possibility that transforming growth factor &#x003b2; production <xref rid="pone.0000707-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and anti-inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0000707-Flanagan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> induced by vaccination might increase susceptibility to malaria. However, there was no indication that higher T cell responses predicted greater susceptibility to malaria, suggesting that there was not a causal link, and the increase in risk was not significant during primary analysis <xref rid="pone.0000707-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The convergence of Incidence Rates and Hazards seen during the second 9 months of monitoring provides further reassurance. Since the vaccinated children are now aged 3&#x02013;8 years, and the incidence of malaria is expected to be lower still, continued analysis of episodes of malaria by vaccination group is not planned.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Protocol Under Which Further 9 Months Follow up was Conducted</p><p>(4.42 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Protocol for ongoing study</p><p>(4.42 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s003"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><p>Original protocol</p><p>(0.31 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s004"><label>Analysis Plan S1</label><caption><p>Analysis Plan for second 9 months follow up</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000707.s005"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000707.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The participants and their parents are thanked.
