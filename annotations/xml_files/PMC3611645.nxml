Sixty virgin girls with complaints of dysmenorrhoea were enrolled in this study, out of which 50 cases were completed the course of treatment and were divided in two groups (study and placebo) and were under treatment for two cycles. In study group a capsule of 30 mg fennel extract, four times a day for three days from start of their menstrual period and in placebo a capsule containing wheat flour in same dose was administered. Intensity of pain was reported by using a 10 - point linear analogue technique. In study group the mean age of menarche was 13.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 and onset age of dysmenorrhoea was 14.5 &#x000b1; 0.1 years. Both groups were relieved but there was significant difference between study and placebo group. Study group shown more effective results than placebo in pain relief (<italic>P</italic>`0.05).

Virgin patients of 15-24 years age with moderate or severe dysmenorrhoea were considered for the study. Total 60 patients were screened, out of them 10 cases were excluded from the study due to evidences of other reasons like secondary/mild dysmenorrhoea, receiving other drugs, pre-existing diagnosed disease and history of hypersensitivity. Remaining 50 patients were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. Each group administered with respective medicament for four times a day for three days from the first day of menstrual period. In the first group (Study group), patients received capsules containing 30mg fennel extract. The second group (Placebo group) received capsules containing wheat flour. The drugs were administered for two consecutive menstrual cycles. Each subject recorded pain intensity before using the drug, five consecutive hours after drug administration and at the end of the day.</p><p><italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> essence was produced by distillation of fennel seeds with water vapour (Barij Essence Co, Iran produced drug and placebo) and was converted into pearl shape (30 mg).

Some studies showed that the onset of menstruation in lower age and longer duration of menstrual period are risk factors for the severity of dysmenorrhoea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Few studies suggest the efficacy of fennel in primary dysmenorrhoea with comparison to placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Complete relief of pain was reported by 80% of the participants in another study by the administration of fennel and 73% of participants reported complete pain relief by Mefenamic acid in dysmenorrhoea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Researches studied an effect of fennel on rat uterine contractions, demonstrated that FEO can inhibit contraction of isolated uterus that was induced by Oxytocin and PGE2.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Based on these conclusions, it can be assumed that, inhibition of contractions leads to pain relief in dysmenorrhoea. In addition, study on effect of fennel on colicky pain among infants suggests that fennel seed oil emulsion is superior to placebo in decreasing intensity of infantile colic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Although, some studies mentioned that fennel extract contains small amounts of Coumarins that could affect coagulation and bleeding,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] no significant difference was observed in current study, in both groups. Results of the study are similar to the earlier work done in 1999.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Available evidences suggests that, the common management is based on pharmacological preparations, where in 10-20% of women do not respond to this course of management. On the other hand use of herbs and other natural products are increasingly preferred. Regarding the effectiveness of fennel, it can be used to relieve the signs and symptoms significantly on primary dysmenorrhoea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Authors are thankful to Barij Essence Co.
