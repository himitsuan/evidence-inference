The humour can be delivered by an individual (eg, by a clown) or recorded stimuli (eg, a video) or participants can be shown how to generate humour themselves. Anecdotally, humour interventions result in positive outcomes; however, the research evidence is limited. Small experimental studies with randomised or quasi-randomised designs have reported beneficial effects of humour interventions on a diverse range of outcomes, such as: pregnancy rates during in vitro fertilisation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> reducing preoperative anxiety in children,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> lowering diastolic blood pressure, respiratory frequency and temperature in children with respiratory pathologies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and in decreasing depression and insomnia in older persons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> there are seldom opportunities to experience humour when living in a nursing home.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>Five of the six studies evaluating the efficacy of humour therapy in nursing home residents reported some benefit,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12 R13 R14 R15">10&#x02013;15</xref> albeit limited by small sample sizes, relatively low-quality methodology and lack of flexibility in matching humour techniques to residents&#x02019; abilities and preferences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> A non-controlled study (n=21) of four clown sessions, evaluated using a modified dementia care mapping protocol, found an overall increase in positive behaviours and decrease in negative behaviours during the sessions in persons with severe dementia; however, there was no follow-up outside the sessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> A non-randomised controlled study (n=61) found that five sessions of comical singing and dancing were associated with decreased self-rated anxiety and depression in nursing home residents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Fortnightly group humour therapy for psychiatric in-patients with either Alzheimer's disease, or late-life depression, did not improve quality-of-life for either group in addition to standard pharmacotherapy (n=20).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Nursing home residents (n=87) randomly assigned to watch humorous movies three times a week showed decreased negative affect following the 12-week intervention compared with both those residents who watched serious movies and controls who received usual care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Residents (n=27) randomly assigned to watch recordings of humorous story-telling weekly for 12&#x02005;weeks reported improved quality-of-life compared to those who watched conventional television and those who received usual care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Eight weekly sessions involving telling jokes, and funny stories and discussions on prioritising humour in daily life decreased reports of pain and perceived loneliness, and increased reported happiness and life satisfaction in residents in the intervention group (n=36) compared with controls (n=34).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>The primary aim of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ACTRN12611000462987) was to evaluate the effectiveness of humour therapy in improving mood in individual residents living in nursing homes. Secondary aims were to investigate the effectiveness of humour therapy on decreasing agitation and other behavioural disturbances, and increasing quality-of-life and social engagement of residents. We utilised a clustered design with randomisation at the facility level as the intervention involved training staff to change their behaviour towards residents, which is difficult to contain to only certain residents within their care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A single-blind two-group longitudinal cluster randomised controlled design was used in SMILE to evaluate humour therapy in Australian nursing homes. The Study protocol details have been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Ethics approval was obtained from the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number 08345). Residents either provided written consent, if judged by the researcher as being able to understand information about the study and make an informed decision about participation, or verbal assent, if incapable of providing written consent, with written consent obtained from a proxy.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Invitations were made to 228 nursing homes located in Sydney, Australia. Eligible homes were: government accredited; located within greater metropolitan Sydney within 1&#x02005;h drive from the University of New South Wales, Sydney; not enrolled in another intervention study; not catering for particular ethnic and minority groups or medical conditions except for dementia; not scheduled for change in management, renovation or programme delivery; able to secure site-specific governance permission and in agreement with study terms. After screening, the first 36 eligible homes were randomised to an intervention or a control group. Eight additional eligible homes on a waiting list replaced homes that withdrew before baseline. One home that began the intervention and was subsequently found to be ineligible because it catered specifically to persons with mental illnesses and drug and alcohol addiction was immediately excluded. Data collection occurred in six rolling cycles between July 2009 and May 2011.</p><p>Within each home, a geographical SMILE neighbourhood was defined following discussion with facility managers. Criteria were that the area accommodated &#x0003c;40 residents, and permitted interaction between residents and the staff member to be trained in humour therapy.</p><p>All eligible residents within SMILE neighbourhoods were invited to participate. Residents were ineligible if they were &#x0003c;50&#x02005;years of age, admitted to full-time care &#x0003c;12&#x02005;weeks prior, exhibiting behaviour presenting a risk to study personnel, foreshadowed to move out of the SMILE neighbourhood within 6&#x02005;months, experiencing severe communication obstacles, acutely unwell, under public guardianship with no person responsible to consent on their behalf, or if they had florid psychiatric symptoms or a known fear of clowns or strangers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012002072F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012002072F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Pattern of nursing home (NH) and resident recruitment and participation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2012002072f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>The humour therapy intervention comprised two components:

ElderClowns tailored their interactions to maximise resident engagement, laughter and enjoyment, adapting to the background, personality, mood and physical and cognitive abilities of the resident. ElderClowns prepared for their work with individual residents, and also improvised based on the residents&#x02019; reactions and to make the conversation and interaction light hearted and playful. Interactions could be based around music&#x02014;serenading the resident with their favourite song, or adapting a song to include their name, encouraging them to dance with each other or the LaughterBoss; could involve asking the resident's advice about a problem that the ElderClown has such as whether to buy a cat or a dog, or be based around jokes relating to a prop such as a slip-on rubber thumb with a light at the end. Interactions could occur in groups and individually depending on the resident's preferences.</p></list-item></list></p><p>For instance, a female resident with moderate dementia might have been engaged by an ElderClown asking her opinion about which hat would suit her best. Hats varied from a formal dress hat, to a sailor's hat to a silly costume hat with attached wig. The resident laughed at how the ElderClown looked in the hats and at her expressions and comments when wearing them, and made some joking comments about the hats. A male resident with severe dementia might have been engaged with a game of pretend tennis using plastic rackets and a ball on a wire. The LaughterBoss held one racket, the resident held the other and the ElderClown controlled the ball, making it easier or more difficult for the players to hit the ball, and also providing exaggerated commentary on the game. The resident tried to hit the ball, tracking it visually and smiled when he succeeded and was praised in the Elderclown's commentary. Information about residents was obtained from resident charts and presession briefings by the LaughterBoss. Postsession debriefing sessions between the ElderClown and LaughterBoss involved a discussion on what did and did not work, and formulation of ideas for the next visit.

Difference between treatment and control groups on change scores on the CMAI pooled across three randomised controlled trials of risperidone were 3. (95% CI 1.78 to 4.22).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> In decreasing agitation, humour therapy had a similar effect to risperidone, the most commonly used antipsychotic in Australia for the treatment of behavioural disturbance in dementia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> Humour therapy showed none of the side effects of risperidone. When adjustments were made for the &#x02018;dosage&#x02019; of humour therapy engagement, humour therapy demonstrated benefits on depression, behavioural disturbance and self-reported dementia quality-of-life effects not reported with medication.</p><p>The strengths of SMILE include: a large sample, clustered design and relatively high follow-up rates. We were able to implement our intervention in real-world nursing homes, despite initial reservations from some managers and staff. The sustained benefits in agitation at follow-up underscore the importance of recruiting staff members into the programme. Limitations are noted. First, data collection staff became &#x02018;unblinded&#x02019; over time for 15 of the 35 homes despite constant reminders to nursing home staff ahead of data collection periods of the importance of maintaining confidentiality of intervention allocation. Second, participating homes might not have been representative of Australian nursing homes. Compared with national data, residents in our sample were similar in average age and dependency level, but were 6% more likely to be female, required less help with activities of daily living and had higher levels of behavioural disturbances. Third, there were variations between residents in the number of ElderClown sessions they received, and variations between homes in the amount of humour initiated by LaughterBosses outside ElderClown sessions. LaughterBosses were not tested for competency in delivering humour. Fourth, the two groups were unbalanced at baseline on several outcome measures, these differences were adjusted for in our statistical modelling. Fifth, adjustment for multiple comparisons was not made to the &#x003b1; for significance, as outcome measures were correlated. Sixth, the intracluster correlations for this sample were much higher than reported in the study on which our power calculations were based, which resulted in lower power than planned.</p><p>Several explanations are possible for the lack of effect on outcome measures other than CMAI agitation. Depression, other forms of behavioural disturbances and self-rated quality-of-life all improved more in residents who experienced higher doses of engagement as a result of humour therapy, suggesting that humour therapy does change these outcomes, even though there was not a statistical advantage of intervention over control groups. There was a floor effect: only 29% of our sample was assessed as having probable or possible depression on the CSDD, and 28% of our sample was rated as not having any agitation symptoms on the CMAI, thereby limiting the potential for improvement. The DEMQOL was developed for persons with mild to severe dementia; however, 33% of residents were unable to complete the self-report version. While we interviewed staff members who knew the resident well, it was difficult for staff to be aware of the quality-of-life related concerns of many residents, particularly those with poor verbal skills. Our data and others showed that DEMQOL proxy scores correlate only mildly or moderately with DEMQOL self-report. The measures used might not have been sensitive to anecdotally reported positive effects such as increased positive mood, and increased initiation of and participation in social activities.</p><p>We offered a novel model of humour therapy delivery combining staff training (LaughterBosses) and professional humour therapists (ElderClowns). This was designed to minimise costs and deliver sustainable practice change within nursing homes. We believe that the active ingredients of the programme are engagement and play. This is supported by our engagement dose analyses and consistent with a needs-driven behaviour explanatory model of behaviours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Increasing social contact and opportunities for play could have fulfilled a need for stimulation which is expressed through agitation. Other tailored models of engaging and stimulating residents might also be successful.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> Challenges in delivering the programme predominantly related to false expectations that, rather than attempting to elicit individual responses from residents enrolled in the study, the ElderClown would perform for any audience. Some suggest that the label &#x02018;ElderClown&#x02019; might not be appropriate in describing the work of the professional performers.</p><p>SMILE demonstrated that there are benefits to increasing positive interactions for residents. If our results are replicated, consideration should be given to systematically introducing humour therapy as a psychosocial intervention to reduce the level of agitation in nursing home residents. More research is needed into the efficacy of different models of delivering humour therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e247" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002072.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e248" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002072.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the SMILE research and humour therapy teams, and the participating nursing homes, residents, families and staff.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors had full access to all of the data (including statistical reports and tables) in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
