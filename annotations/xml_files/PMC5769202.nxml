However, this kind of therapy is yet underevaluated by the modern sciences.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The mainstream ophthalmologists rejected the Bates method during his generation and remains as same even today.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Anyhow, it is seen that the eye exercises strengthen the eye muscles, and thus, diplopia and the point of convergence decrease. Meanwhile, <italic>Trataka Yoga Kriya</italic> of the ancient Indian tradition has been practiced throughout India and is strongly believed to increase the eye sight.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In the present research scenario, due to the lack of evidential studies over nonpharmacological treatment approaches in treating myopia, there is a need to study for different alternative approaches. This will help in extending the scope of physical therapy in modern medicine.

The inclusion criteria were an age group of 18&#x02013;25 years, a refractive index ranging from &#x02212;1.00 to &#x02212;10.00 diopters, both genders, i.e., male and female, and myopia for the past 5 years, and the exclusion criteria were any lenticular or corneal opacity, other known ocular pathology, and infantile myopia. After receiving informed consent, participants were assessed by an ophthalmologist and the baseline values of outcomes were noted. The assessor was blinded and through simple randomization divided the participants into two groups with 24 participants and/or 48 eyes each. Participants were taken for a subjective and objective assessment before and after the treatment. The materials used in this study were Snellen's chart, lenses tray, autorefraction equipment, room temperature water, ice cold water, napkins, and candles. Intervention was given for 8 weeks; at the end of which, participants were assessed by the same ophthalmologist.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Procedure</title><p>In the Group A, the participants performed eye exercises for 8 weeks. The exercises given to this group were based on Bates technique; they were near to far shifting, palming, solarization, eye wash, eye squeezing, eye circles, and eye massage.</p><p>In the Group B, <italic>Trataka Yoga Kriya</italic> was performed by the participants for 8 weeks. The following activity was done by the participants of this group for 8 weeks. <italic>Trataka</italic> means steady gazing. It can be done on any external objects such as a candle, a leaf, a crystal, and a Shiva Linga. This included two steps; they were <italic>Antaranga Trataka</italic> and <italic>Bahiranga Trataka</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-4"><title>Results</title><p>The results of this study were analyzed using the SPSS software version 20, in which the means and standard deviation of the normally distributed data of the participants were calculated.

The literature review shows that previous studies have stated that there is great effect of different eye exercises on refractive error.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The reason behind the effect these eye exercises show is thought to be as it strengthens accommodation, which is the power of changing focus of eyes for vision. However, the basic concept behind <italic>Trataka Yoga Kriya</italic> is relaxation of mind and eye that in turn improves vision.</p><p>In this study, it was seen that there was a slight reduction in the myopia by performing the eye exercises. Hence, it states that Bates eye exercise has significant effect over the refractive errors over the participants involved in this study. However, due to lack of evidential studies over this, Bates method and <italic>Trataka Yoga</italic> are not yet proved to have a significant effect in reducing myopia.</p><p>The participants in this study got a very minimal reduction of power. Therefore, it could be considered because of stress relief phenomena. Eventually, selection bias (the participants with range of refractive error were wide) and subjective assessment errors might also be some of the reasons. Certain variables were uncontrolled in this study, and their effect influenced the results was assumed to be null.</p><p>Whether or not the participants in the eye exercises group were actually doing the eye exercises in proper repetition and accuracy and the subjects in the <italic>Trataka</italic> group, how far were able to imagine the image of the candle flame in their inner vision. The lifestyle and dietary habits of the participants were assumed to have no effect on the muscle strengthening and improvement in the accommodation.</p><p>The future directions would be that the results in this study could be applied over the population diagnosed with myopia. This study did not include long-term intervention and follow-up period though exercises are effective for long-term benefits of interventions. There is a need for more research to be done to provide strong evidence whether Bates eye exercises and <italic>Trataka Yoga</italic> are effective for the reduction of myopia.</p><p>By observing the obtained results, the limitations would be lack of a larger sample size, short interventional protocol duration, the <italic>Trataka</italic> being tiresome for the participants to perform as they had to constantly gaze on the flame of the candle which could cause inconvenience for them; as the participants were students, they were asked to perform the exercises and the <italic>Trataka</italic> before and after the college hours, respectively. This caused inconvenience for the students to do the activities regularly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study concluded that both Bates eye exercises therapy and <italic>Trataka Yoga Kriya</italic> in reducing refractive errors in myopia were not effective.
