Since these patients have endotracheal tubes, cleaning and keeping the airways open through suctioning should be done to increase oxygenation. This study aimed to evaluate effect of open and closed suctioning methods on respiratory parameters of infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this crossover clinical trial, 44 infants were selected among those undergone mechanical ventilation in NICU of Isfahan's Al-Zahra Hospital using convenience sampling method. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In the first group, open suctioning was carried out and after three hours of cleaning, closed suctioning was done. In the second group, closed suctioning was firstly done and following three hours of cleaning, open suctioning was implemented. Respiratory rate (RR) and percentage of arterial blood oxygen saturation was measured before, during and after each type of suctioning. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and independent student's t-test.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Findings:</title><p>There was a significant difference between mean respiratory rate and arterial blood oxygen saturation in infants before, during and after the closed and open suctioning. The percentage of arterial blood oxygen saturation had a significant reduction in open method compared to closed method during suctioning and immediately after it. RR three minutes after suctioning showed a significant reduction in both steps in open method compared to closed method.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Close method caused fewer changes in hemodynamic status of infants.

One of the standard care aspects in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) is caring the infants undergoing mechanical ventilator,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] which is done to reduce their need for oxygen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Endotracheal intubation is required to establish mechanical ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The existence of endotracheal tube causes tissues irritation and increased secretion. It is essential to regularly clean and suction the artificial airway to maintain ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Although endotracheal tube suction is a device to remove secretions and keep the airways open, it causes many complications. Some of the early complications of suctioning include changes in blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and oxygen saturation percentage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Therefore, assessing vital signs during endotracheal tube suctioning is necessary for controlling and preventing more serious complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Late complications have many side effects and risks for infants such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, nosocomial pneumonia and increased duration of hospitalization and it can be fatal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] There are two methods for endotracheal tube suction, open and closed methods. The standard open method for removing secretions of infant's airway is performed by separating the infant from ventilator and crossing the sterilized suction catheter through the endotracheal tube. Closed suction technique is done by connecting an instrument to the ventilator which allows suction catheter enters into endotracheal tube through a one-way valve without removing the infant from the ventilator. Continuation of mechanical ventilation during suctioning would keep positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with minimal changes in fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] One of the advantages of closed suction system is to reduce respiratory pollution and pulmonary infections. Another potential advantage is its easy application which only needs one nurse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In closed suction method, nurse would not be infected by patient's endotracheal tube secretions and suction catheter can be used frequently.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Following principles and choosing a suitable method of endotracheal tube suctioning is also helpful to minimize the complications of endotracheal tube suction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Some studies have shown that infants who have been suctioned by closed method had more physiological stability than those with open method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and oxygen saturation loss rate reduced with closed method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Furthermore, lung volume reduction which is due to the separation of infant from ventilator was reported in the open suctioning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Some researchers have suggested that closed suction is the best method for reducing nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care unit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Considering that very few and limited studies have been done on complications and advantages of these two suction methods for infants and lack of evidence comparing these two methods in Iran, this study aimed to determine the effect of open and closed suction methods on respiratory parameters of infants undergoing mechanical ventilation in Isfahan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS</sc> A<sc>ND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a crossover clinical trial study which was performed on infants undergoing mechanical ventilation admitted in NICU of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan in 2010. It was ethically approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. After receiving written informed consent from the parents, 44 consecutive infants were selected when following inclusion criteria were met: lack of neurological-muscle diseases, congenital heart diseases and its resulted impairment; and lack of active bleeding, fever, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for at least 4 hours before the study. Three subjects were excluded from the study due to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and extubation before completing the data collection. Infants were randomly divided into two groups. In the first step in group A, open suctioning was done and after 3 hours of cleaning, closed suctioning was done as the second step. In the group B, first, closed suctioning was performed and after three hours of cleaning, open suctioning was implemented. Demographic characteristics of the infants entered in the data record form and respiratory rate (RR) as well as percentage of arterial blood oxygen saturation were assessed 1, 2 and 3 minutes before suction, during it, immediately after it and 1, 2 and 3 minutes after the suction. Infants&#x02019; pulse rate during suctioning was measured through pulse oximetry and intensive care monitor. Arterial blood oxygen saturation was assessed by pulse oximetry. Arterial blood pressure and respiratory rate were recorded by intensive care monitor. Infant's RR was measured by observing on the ventilator. Suctioning was done by a trained nurse.</p><p>In open suctioning, after wearing sterile gloves, the rate of catheter insertion was measured, and then the infant was disconnected from the ventilator and 0.2 cc of 0.9% saline was entered into endotracheal tube. Afterward, the suction catheter was slowly and with no pressure inserted into the designated location inside endotracheal tube (0.5 cm more than endotracheal tube size) and thereafter, it was done with pressure of 80 mmHg for 5-10 seconds and the infant was again connected to the ventilator.</p><p>The steps of the closed suction included connecting the closed suction catheter to ventilator tube, injection of 0.1 to 0.2 cc 0.9% saline inside catheter and inserting the closed suction catheter inside endotracheal tube from the plastic cover to the pre-measured size (0.5 cm more than endotracheal tube size). Suctioning was applied with pressure of 80 mmHg for 5-10 seconds.</p><p>After sampling and assessing the mean of the parameters, due to the lack of difference between 1, 2 and 3 minutes before suction and also after it, as the measured values 3 minutes before and 3 minutes after suction were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and independent student's t-test.
