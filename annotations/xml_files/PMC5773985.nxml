Performance of painless surgical procedure is highly appreciated by the patients and is possible through the use of local anesthesia, conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Postoperative pain can also be controlled by the use of opioids, as opioid receptors exist in the peripheral nervous system and offers the possibility of providing postoperative analgesia in the surgical patient. The present study compares the efficacy of 0.5% bupivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.3 mg buprenorphine in minor oral surgical procedures.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>The present study was conducted in 50 patients who required minor oral surgical procedures under local anesthesia. Two types of local anesthetic solutions were used- 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200000 epinephrine in group I and a mixture of 39 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200000 and 1 ml of 300 &#x003bc;g buprenorphine (3 &#x003bc;g/kg)in group II.

Amide types of local anesthetics (bupivacaine, etidocaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, and articaine) with a moderate-to-long duration of action are commonly used for these surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Bupivacaine hydrochloride, introduced in 1963, is a long-acting amide type of local anesthetic. It is a powerful anesthetic with an intermediate onset of action (2&#x02013;5 min), allowing a slow return to normal sensation (180&#x02013;600 min).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It provides additional analgesia time, known as residual analgesia, and minimizes the duration of postoperative pain, facilitating postoperative care, and maintenance of proper oral hygiene.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Infection if present alters the ability of local anesthetic to achieve adequate pain control during surgery as the low pH of the inflamed tissue leads to quick dissociation of local anesthetic to cation form, which is not able to penetrate the phospholipid membrane of the neuronal cells. Locally injected opioids may act synergistically with local anesthetics in inflamed tissues and increase the perioperative analgesic effect.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic, oripavine alkaloid derived from thebaine. It is a long-acting, lipid-soluble, mixed agonist-antagonist opioid analgesic which was first synthesized in 1966.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The low abuse liability of the drug in humans soon turned it into a widely used therapeutic agent in patients with opioid dependence. The principal clinical application of buprenorphine is as an analgesic for moderate-to-severe pain in perioperative setting.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The analgesic effect of buprenorphine appears to depend on the integrity of descending fibers from the rostral ventromedial medulla. Residual analgesic effects of opioids after inactivation of descending fibers may be caused by peripheral effects in the presence of inflammation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Buprenorphine is shown to be fully efficacious with an antinociceptive potency 20-70 times higher than morphine. It binds to mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors and dissociates slowly from these receptors. Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu opioid agonist and a kappa opioid antagonist.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The parenteral formulation of buprenorphine has an onset time of 5-15 min, and duration of action is about 8 h after administration. It is metabolized by the gut and liver.</p><p>The various advantages associated with the use of buprenorphine are that it has a longer duration of analgesic action, low addiction propensity, and a high therapeutic index. The adverse effects associated with it include sedation, nausea, itching, constipation, addiction in higher doses, confusion, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurred vision, and respiratory depression with the overdose of drug.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of 0.5% bupivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine with buprenorphine in providing prolonged postoperative analgesia during various minor oral surgical procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifty healthy adult patients who reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery requiring minor oral surgical procedures were included in this study. Various minor surgical procedures included incision and drainage of abscess, removal of impacted third molars, apicoectomy, neurectomy, surgical extraction of teeth, cyst enucleation, and fracture reduction and fixation under local anesthesia. Diagnosis was made on the basis of history, clinical examination, and radiological examination. Patients were informed about the surgical procedure, postsurgical recommendations, and possible complications. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Exclusion criteria included patients with a history of uncontrolled medical illness, sensitivity to local anesthesia, tolerance or addiction to analgesic drugs, pregnancy, bleeding disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neurologic, psychiatric illness, or positive drug abuse history. The study protocol and informed consent form was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Treatment groups</title><p>Patients were assigned to one of the two equal groups by randomization method using table of random numbers. Patients in Group I (25 patients) received various intraoral nerve blocks as indicated using 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, whereas patients in Group II (25 patients) received the same blocks using the mixture of 39 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 1 ml of 300 microgram buprenorphine (3 &#x003bc;g/kg). In addition, local infiltration was given in both the groups wherever needed to achieve hemostasis of the site. Analgesics were prescribed postoperatively only when the patient began to complaint of pain. The prescribed analgesic was tablet ketorol 10 mg (ketorolac 10 mg - Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited). Patients were asked to note down the number of tablets required, if any, to relieve pain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Assessment</title><p>It included evaluation of following parameters in both the groups intraoperatively and postoperatively:</p><p>

Buprenorphine has been used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain as a supplement to anesthesia for behavior and psychiatric disorders and as a maintenance medication for heroin dependence.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The analgesic effect of buprenorphine appears to depend on the integrity of descending fibers from the rostral ventromedial medulla. Prolonged duration of analgesia is due to the fact that buprenorphine dissociates very slowly from opioid receptors. The postoperative analgesic effects of buprenorphine added to local anesthetic have been discussed by various authors.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Being a partial mu opioid agonist, buprenorphine has a wider safety profile as compared to full mu agonists. Further, the slow dissociation of buprenorphine from the receptor may result in fewer signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal upon termination of buprenorphine therapy than those which occur with full mu opioid agonists such as morphine, heroin, and methadone. Antagonist effects at the kappa receptors are associated with limited spinal analgesia, dysphoria, and psychomimetic effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Buprenorphine can be used by various routes in human beings such as epidural, intravenous, intramuscular, sublingual, transdermal, delivery routes[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and for intraoral nerve blocks.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The pH of the tissue and pKa of drug are the most important factors which affect the time of onset of anesthesia. The pKa defines the pH at which the ionized and nonionized forms of a drug are in complete equilibrium, that is, half of the drug is ionized. Only the nonionized form of the local anesthetic can diffuse across lipid nerve sheath and cell membrane. pKa also reflects the proportion of local anesthetic that is in a diffusible nonionized state and therefore contributes greatly to the rate of onset of anesthesia. The pKa values of commonly used local anesthetics are greater than the normal tissue pH (approximately 7.4) which means the drugs exist predominantly in the ionized form after injection. At normal tissue pH, the proportion of nonionized form of bupivacaine is 20%; this contributes in part to slightly slower onset of anesthesia with bupivacaine, particularly for nerve block anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In the present study, the mean value for time of onset as referred to lip and tongue numbness and also on pinprick test in bupivacaine group was 3.00 &#x000b1; 1.08 and 7.28 &#x000b1; 1.59 min, respectively, as compared to 2.92 &#x000b1; 1.03 min and 7.40 &#x000b1; 1.93 min, respectively, in buprenorphine combination group. Contrary to our results, Brkovic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found the mean time of onset as referred to lower lip numbness as 8.7 &#x000b1; 2.2 min and 7.4 &#x000b1; 1.4 min on pinprick test while using 0.5% bupivacaine (2 ml) for the lower third molar surgery. Swarnkar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported the onset time of sensory block (with intravenous regional anesthesia) when 0.3 mg buprenorphine was added to the local anesthetic as 5.0 &#x000b1; 1.0 min and the onset time of sensory block as 4.0 &#x000b1; 0.4 min when 0.3 mg buprenorphine was given intramuscularly. Sarkar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported the onset time of sensory block as 3.28 min (supraclavicular block) when 1 ml (0.3 mg) buprenorphine was added to the mixture of local anesthetics. Our results are in agreement with those of Trullenque-Eriksson and Guisado-Moya[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] who found the mean onset of time for inferior alveolar nerve block as 3.68 &#x000b1; 3.11 min and for buccal nerve as 1.95 &#x000b1; 1.25 min while using 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine for surgical extraction of mandibular third molars. Duration of the effect of an anesthetic is proportional to its degree of protein binding. Those agents who have a high affinity for the protein component of a nerve are less liable to diffuse from the injection site and be absorbed into the systemic circulation. Bupivacaine's long duration of action is largely due to this characteristic. Bupivacaine has one of the greatest protein binding values out of all the amide local anesthetics. The reported protein binding value for bupivacaine is 95%. However, the duration of the effect of the local anesthetic is also dependent on the injection site and the concentration of vasoconstrictor present in the anesthetic solution.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In the present study, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean duration of anesthetic effect of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 (526.84 &#x000b1; 101.13 min) and buprenorphine combination group (540.80 &#x000b1; 103.78 min).

Overall, buprenorphine is a highly effective analgesic for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain. It has a unique pharmacological and physiochemical profile allowing for relatively safe use and flexibility with regard to dosage and dosage forms. Thus, buprenorphine can be used in combination with bupivacaine for patients undergoing minor oral surgical procedures to provide postoperative analgesia for a longer duration, but it should be used cautiously in individuals with a past or current history of substance abuse or dependence, as it produces opioid-like subjective and physiologic effects dependent on the dose and the route of administration.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors wish
