In a 24-week clinical trial, dapagliflozin, an investigational sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, improved glycemic control in patients inadequately controlled with metformin. The present study is an extension that was undertaken to evaluate dapagliflozin as long-term therapy in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a long-term extension (total 102 weeks) of a 24-week phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to blinded daily treatment (placebo, or dapagliflozin 2.5 to 5, or 10 mg) plus open-label metformin (&#x02265;1,500 mg). The previously published primary endpoint was change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 weeks. This paper reports the follow-up to week 102, with analysis of covariance model performed at 24 weeks with last observation carried forward; a repeated measures analysis was utilized to evaluate changes from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 546 patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatments. The completion rate for the 78-week double-blind extension period was lower for the placebo group (63.5%) than for the dapagliflozin groups (68.3% to 79.8%). At week 102, mean changes from baseline HbA1c (8.06%) were +0.02% for placebo compared with -0.48% (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0008), -0.58% (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), and -0.78% (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) for dapagliflozin 2.5 to 5, and 10 mg, respectively. In addition, all dapagliflozin groups had sustained reductions from baseline in FPG (-1.07 to -1.47 mmol/l) and body weight (-1.10 to -1.74 kg) at 102 weeks, whereas increases were noted in placebo-treated patients for both of these outcomes. Events of hypoglycemia were rare and were not severe. Evidence suggestive of genital infection was reported in 11.7% to 14.6% of dapagliflozin patients and 5.1% of placebo patients, with one related discontinuation (dapagliflozin 5 mg). Evidence suggestive of urinary tract infection was reported in 8.0% to 13.3% of dapagliflozin patients and 8.0% of placebo patients, with one related discontinuation (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dapagliflozin added to metformin for 102 weeks enabled sustained reductions in HbA1c, FPG, and weight without increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled on metformin alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00528879">NCT00528879</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dapagliflozin</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>SGLT2</kwd><kwd>sodium-glucose cotransporter 2</kwd><kwd>glycemic control</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Treatment of type 2 diabetes often begins with lifestyle management and/or metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As &#x003b2;-cell function declines in the presence of insulin resistance, this makes maintenance of glycemic control challenging and usually necessitates add-on therapies. Because metformin acts to improve insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], the addition of therapy utilizing an insulin-independent pathway may be advantageous.</p><p>Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) represents a novel approach to reduce hyperglycemia independently of insulin secretion or action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. SGLT2, located in the renal proximal tubule, reabsorbs most of the filtered glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and its inhibition represents a new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin, a potent and selective SGLT2 inhibitor, has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes when used as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] or in combination with metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], sulfonylureas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], thiazolidinedione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], or insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>When dapagliflozin was added to metformin for 24 weeks in patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &#x02265;7% and &#x02264;10%), there was a dose-related mean reduction in HbA1c by -0.67% with dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, -0.70% with dapagliflozin 5 mg, and -0.84% with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to -0.3% with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The present report describes a long-term double-blind extension of this study to examine the effectiveness and safety of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin for 102 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A detailed description of the 24-week methods was published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The 78-week extension is described below. This double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multicenter study recruited patients from 80 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and USA. The study was performed in accordance of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and was approved by the institutional ethics review board at each site. The most frequently utilized boards were New England Institutional Review Board, Wellesley, Massachusetts (29 sites in the USA) and IRB Services, Aurora, Ontario (19 sites in Canada). All patients provided written informed consent, which included consent for the extension period.</p><p>Patients who completed the first 24-week period were eligible to continue in a long-term, double-blind extension period to 102 weeks. During the extension period, patients remained on their original randomly-assigned (1:1:1:1) blinded treatment (placebo, or dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg) once daily and continued open-label metformin (&#x02265;1,500 mg/day). Patients receiving rescue therapy (primarily pioglitazone, or acarbose) during the first 24 weeks continued to receive rescue therapy to 102 weeks. During the 78-week extension period, patients were eligible to receive rescue medication if the HbA1c value was &#x0003e;8.0% during weeks 24 to 50, was &#x0003e;7.5% during weeks 50 to 76, or was &#x0003e;7.0% after week 76. These strict rescue criteria ensured that even with a fully double-blinded long-term design, the participants in all groups were provided with adequate glycemic control. Although the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c at 24 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the prespecified exploratory objectives in this study included assessment of the change from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight in the extension period for each treatment group. The exploratory endpoints also included the proportion of patients who achieved a therapeutic glycemic response defined as HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% at week 102. Safety outcomes included reported non-serious and serious adverse events, discontinuation due to adverse events, events of special interest, laboratory abnormalities, and change in vital signs as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Formal statistical testing was performed for the primary endpoint and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model at 24 weeks with the last observation carried forward approach for missing week 24 data excluding data after rescue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. At week 102, longitudinal repeated measures analyses using observed data without any data imputation were used to determine the change in HbA1c, FPG, and total body weight from baseline over time; the model included the categorical fixed effects of treatment, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement and baseline measurement-by-week interaction. Rescue was added as an additional categorical fixed effect in this mixed model when the analysis was performed on data regardless of rescue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From the 546 originally randomized patients, 476 (87.2%) continued into the 78-week extension period. Of these, 339 (71.2%) completed the 102-week study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). During the 78-week extension, the completion rate was lower for the placebo group (63.5%) than for the dapagliflozin groups (68.3 to 79.8%). This was largely due to more patients in the placebo group (23.5%) withdrawing during the extension period for lack of efficacy, whereas withdrawals were 13.3, 13.9, and 7.6% with dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg, respectively.

This treatment acts independently of &#x003b2;-cell function or insulin sensitivity, thereby suggesting an alternative or complementary approach to currently available treatments and offering an additional therapeutic option throughout the natural history of type 2 diabetes. Recent approval by the European Medicines Agency makes dapagliflozin the first agent in this new class of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><p>Strengths of this study include its design as a large trial that remained double-blinded throughout the long-term extension, unlike those conducted as open-label extensions. A greater proportion of dapagliflozin-treated patients remained in the trial throughout the full 2 years, substantiating the durability of the glucose-lowering effect. There were no apparent baseline differences across study groups to explain the variation in glycemic outcomes; however, treatment-related weight reduction is likely to be a factor in enhancement of glucose reduction. While efficacy analyses generally excluded rescue, safety analyses included all data regardless of rescue in order to get a comparison to placebo that was as unbiased as possible. A potential limitation of this study is the number of patients needing rescue medication in the placebo group. Although this might limit the statistical interpretation of durability of the glucose-lowering effect of dapagliflozin, it also emphasizes the clinical utility of dapagliflozin. The present study design, which included a placebo control group for 102 weeks, employed strict glycemic control criteria to ensure that all patients received a quality of care consistent with current guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Thus, patients whose HbA1c exceeded 7.5% at 50 weeks or 7.0% at 76 weeks received rescue therapy and were not included in the final efficacy analysis. Failure to maintain a consistent decrease in blood pressure during long-term dapagliflozin therapy may reflect the extension trial design in which investigators could adjust antihypertensive therapy according to clinical need, which may have overridden any potential blood pressure lowering effect from dapagliflozin. In addition, the mean baseline blood pressure was already near or at goal for patients with diabetes.</p><p>To date, the published clinical trial data on dapagliflozin are from short-term (12 to 24 weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or 1-year trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], all of which have demonstrated efficacy of this agent in management of hyperglycemia. The data from this 102-week trial demonstrate sustained glycemic and weight-loss benefits. Because SGLT2 inhibition is an investigative and relatively new concept within the type 2 diabetes arena, no direct comparative data with other SGLT2 agents are available. Dapagliflozin has demonstrated greater or augmented efficacy compared with commonly prescribed antidiabetic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], suggesting this novel mechanism of action may be considered as an addition to treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes for its advantage of having a sustained effect in HbA1c reduction and weight loss.</p><p>The durability of type 2 diabetes therapy is typically limited by the natural history of the disease such that the progressive decline in &#x003b2;-cell function superimposed upon insulin resistance restricts the continuing efficacy of interventions that are dependent on insulin production or insulin action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The present study demonstrates the increased glycemic and weight-loss benefits of the non-insulin-dependent SGLT2 inhibition mechanism. The low rate of discontinuations due to adverse events indicates a favorable tolerability profile that makes this agent an important addition to the treatment armamentarium. As this is the first entry in a new class of antidiabetic agents, dapagliflozin provides an important additional option for clinicians managing patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.</p><p>A better understanding of the relationship between glucosuria and genitourinary infections should be provided with ongoing safety analyses of the dapagliflozin trial program. Further study of the effects of dapagliflozin on metabolic surrogate markers will assist in discrimination of non-glycemic benefits. As an example, increased serum uric acid is frequently associated with raised BMI, blood pressure, FPG, and triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and has been implicated as part of the 'metabolic syndrome' cluster of risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The mean decreases in serum uric acid observed with dapagliflozin here and in other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which are consistent with the uricosuric action of this agent, might therefore indicate potential added benefits, but this requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dapagliflozin added to metformin over 102 weeks showed sustained improved glycemic control, modest weight reduction, and no increased risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone. These effects suggest a complementary use of the insulin independent effects of dapagliflozin in combination with metformin.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>FPG: fasting plasma glucose; HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin; SGLT2: sodium-glucose cotransporter 2; UTI: urinary tract infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link> (available upon request from the corresponding author).
