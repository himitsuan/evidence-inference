Currently, EP treatment options comprise expectant management, medical and surgical (mainly salpingectomy and salpingostomy) approaches.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, aggressive tubal surgery may impact fertility and ovarian reserve due to its effect on the adjacent ovarian tissues.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Therefore, medical treatment may represent a noninvasive and reliable strategy for patients with EP wanting to preserve their fertility.</p><p>Currently, methotrexate (MTX), a folinic acid antagonist, has been widely used as a first-line therapy for hemodynamically stable patients with EP since the first report of its use in this situation by Tanaka et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The current systemic MTX treatment includes administration of a single-dose, double-dose, or multiple-dose of MTX in stable patients with EP. However, no consensus has reached on the clinical priority and choice of different doses of MTX in treating EP. It is documented that MTX achieves a success rate from 70% to 87%; subsequent surgery is required for patients experiencing MTX treatment failure.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The adverse effect of MTX on fertility is another important concern.</p><p>Uterine artery chemoembolization (UACE) is an intervention approach concurrent with uterine artery embolization (UAE) and local delivery of chemotherapeutics, which functions not only by the toxic effects of drugs but also arterial occlusion-mediated tissue ischemia. In addition, UACE allows a higher concentration and duration of MTX that targeted to the gestational sac in EP patients, causing less systemic toxic effects than systemic MTX administration.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Currently, combined uterine arterial MTX infusion and embolization therapy has been used in the treatment of nontubal EP, such as cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) and cervical pregnancy, and is considered as a viable, safe modality associated with lower morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and rapid clinical recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> However, the application and efficiency of UACE in tubal or uncategorized EP requires more clinical practice; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antimetabolism drug frequently used in interventional therapy, which could induce blastocyst apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of thymidylate synthase, thereby leading to interference with DNA or RNA synthesis, and inhibition of cell cycle and survival. However, whether 5-FU combined with MTX could synergistically improve the efficiency of sole MTX in EP is unknown. Therefore, our study aims to compare the efficiency and safety of concurrent UAE and perfusion of MTX or MTX&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;5-FU in the treatment of EP.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and randomization</title><p>One hundred eligible female patients with EP were prospectively recruited in this randomized controlled study from December 2012 to February 2015. Major inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of EP based on the following clinical symptoms: suppressed menstruation history, abdominal pain, mild to severe vaginal bleeding, high serum levels of &#x003b2;-human chorionic gonadotropin (&#x003b2;-HCG) over the normal threshold, and the presence of a gestational sac outside the corpus uteri detected by transvaginal ultrasound; patient who refused the surgical resection or desired to preserve the uterus; and patient who signed the informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the presence of abdominal hemorrhage and significant shock; severe cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease; unstable hemodynamic status; and noncompliance with interventional therapy. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Tangdu Hospital. All patients were informed about the design and potential risk of the trial before the intervention and signed informed consents. After appropriate counseling, patients willing to receive UAE and intra-arterial drug infusion were transferred to our department.</p><p>Eligible female patients were enrolled on the basis of the CONSORT Statement Extension for Randomized Controlled Trials with allocation concealment, as shown in the flowchart in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. A computer-generated randomization table using the SAS statistical software (SAS version 9.3, Cary, NC) was used to allocate the sequentially enrolled patients into 2 equal groups by an independent statistician who was not involved in this study. The 100 consecutive patients scheduled to undergo UACE therapy were randomized into the MTX group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) and the MTX&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;5-FU group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) according the random allocation number. For the allocation concealment, opaque envelopes containing the group-allocation information were sequentially numbered and closed by an individual not involved in the study. The group-allocation information was blinded to both patients and interventional radiologists who performed all the angiographic examinations and treatments for the duration of the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of patient selection and allocation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9722-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Medical treatment</title><p>Patients in the MTX group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) were intra-arterially infused with sole MTX (Lingnan Pharmaceutical Co.

Digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) (Siemens, Munich, Germany) was then performed to confirm that the catheter and guide wire were correctly deployed. Then, 80 to 120&#x0200a;mg of MTX dissolved in 80 to 120 mL saline was infused bilaterally into the uterine arteries over 15 min in patients receiving sole MTX medical therapy. In the other group, 500&#x0200a;mg 5-FU was infused intra-arterially besides the MTX injection as above. Afterward, the bilateral uterine arteries in each group were embolized using gelatin sponge particles (0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x0200a;mm). Subsequently, DSA postembolization was performed to confirm the complete obstruction of uterine arterial flow. Successful embolization was defined as the disappearance of vascularity of the gestational sac on arteriography.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Clinical efficiency evaluation</title><p>Serum &#x003b2;-HCG levels in all patients were examined and recorded preoperatively and 3 days postoperatively, and then weekly for the next 5 weeks, until the &#x003b2;-HCG was negative. The primary outcome was defined as the decreased ratio of &#x003b2;-HCG compared with preoperative values, against postoperative treatment time. The secondary outcomes were comprised of treatment success rate, time to successful resolution, and fallopian tube patency rate. The success of the medical management of EP was defined as &#x003b2;-HCG level becoming negative (&#x0003c;5&#x0200a;mIU/mL) after administration of MTX or MTX&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;5-FU, no signs of EP, decreased or no further increase of gestational sac size, and no internal hemorrhage. Medical management failure was signaled by symptoms indicative of tube rupture, including hemodynamic instability, increasing abdominal pain, rapidly increasing &#x003b2;-HCG value, and a necessity for surgical intervention. The first time point when the &#x003b2;-HCG level became negative was defined as the time to successful resolution. Fallopian tube patency was confirmed when contrast agents were diffused properly and no occlusions were shown in angiography. Patients who were lost to follow-up or transferred to other medications were considered censored for the outcome of time to successful resolution.

The baseline characteristics are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. All the patients presented to our department had symptoms of pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Metrorrhagia was noted in 42 patients in the MTX group and 44 in the combination medical treatment group. Women aged between 22 and 30 years were the predominant population at a 62% in this study. Six patients had previous EP, 4 in the MTX group, and 2 in the MTX&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;5-FU group, and all had a previous unilateral salpingectomy. Twenty-three women underwent diagnostic curettage and no chorionic placenta was found. There were 35 cases of tubal and 65 nontubal ectopic pregnancies that were mainly comprised of ovarian pregnancies (20%) and CSPs (25%). The median &#x003b2;-HCG at diagnosis was 13,659&#x0200a;mIU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 4326, 32,506), 15,429&#x0200a;mIU/mL (IQR 3927, 41,203) in the MTX group, and 2687&#x0200a;mIU/mL (IQR 5478, 36,410) in the MTX&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;5-FU group. Seventeen patients had absolutely higher &#x003b2;-HCG levels over 30,000&#x0200a;mIU/mL. By ultrosonography, diameter of the gestational sac diameters was ranging from 0.7 to 2.9&#x0200a;cm; the embryo within the gestational sac could be seen in 30 patients, and 17 had fetal cardiac activity; in the remaining 13 patients, only a yolk sac was identified.

As presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the gestational sac was surrounded by numerous arterial branches for blood supply before embolization, as shown in the angiography; after the embolization, both uterine arteries were obstructed and the vascularity of the gestational sac completely disappeared. The time for total lesion disappearance was 29.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;4.0 (5&#x02013;56) days in the whole population.

One patient in MTX group was lost to the follow-up and 1 patient was excluded due to administration of mifepristone during the follow-up. It was also noted that the clinical success rate de-escalated against the level of preoperative &#x003b2;-HCG with treatment priority shown in patients with a preoperative &#x003b2;-HCG of &#x0003c;10,000&#x0200a;mIU/mL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

However, decision making for the treatment of EP is still challenging especially when MTX treatment fails and subsequent surgery is needed. Our study showed comparable efficiency of UAE combined with MTX, or MTX and 5-FU in treating EP with success rates of 90% and 86%, respectively.</p><p>UAE was initially considered as a conservative treatment for various obstetric and gynecological conditions, such as postpartum hemorrhage and uterine myomas, which has been used in the management of EP in this decade. UAE is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in treating EP by blocking blood flow in the uterine arteries, decreasing the vascularization surrounding the pregnancy and promoting trophoblastic degeneration.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Currently, the potential use of UAE has been explored mainly in nontubal ectopic pregnancies such as CSP. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization has been shown to be more effective than systemic MTX treatment for termination of CSP.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Moreover, adjunctive therapy with embolization has significantly reduced the duration of hospital stay than when MTX is used alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Krissi et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> reported that a combination of uterine arterial MTX infusion and embolization with systemic MTX is an effective and safe treatment for nontubal ectopic pregnancies in women who try to conceive. Shen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that the mean time until normalization of the serum &#x003b2;-HCG was 37.7 days, and the mean time until CSP mass disappearance was 33.3 days after MTX administration combined with UAE. In the overall EP population in our study, the mean time to successful resolution was 26.74 days, and 29.7 days until the mass disappearance for patients receiving MTX treatment and UAE. Notably, uterine arterial infusion and embolization were successfully performed in all patients without any related complications. Active bleeding in the peritoneum in 33 cases ceased soon after embolization. The embryos in 30 patients were confirmed by ultrasound to have died 3 days after the procedure. The &#x003b2;-HCG value dropped to below 15&#x0200a;mIU/mL at 3 to 21 days. Hemorrhage in the peritoneum dissolved after 7 days in all cases. The mixed mass disappeared after 1 month. Hysterosalpingography was performed 3 months after the procedure in 19 patients and patent fallopian tubes were demonstrated in 16 patients in Gong's report.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>The 5-FU is an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase and is a commonly used intervention therapy. The 5-FU can induce blastocyst apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of thymidylate synthase, thereby leading to interference with DNA or RNA synthesis, and inhibition of cell cycle and survival. It is documented that gestational trophoblastic neoplasms show high sensitivity and specificity to 5-FU monotherapy and combination therapy with actinomycin D.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Our study investigated whether 5-FU combined with MTX could synergistically improve the efficiency of sole MTX in EP. As the data showed, the additional supplement of 5-FU did not have a further positive impact on the success rate, &#x003b2;-HCG normalization time or the time to mass disappearance, compared to the use of sole MTX with UAE. However, the addition of 5-FU might increase the risk of side effects associated with the dose&#x02013;effect of this cytotoxic drug. Therefore, other treatment modalities that complement to UAE, aside from MTX, should be further discussed.</p><p>The present study is limited to the small sample size and its nature of single center study. In addition, our study concluded that additional application of 5-FU did not show priority to the UAE&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;MTX therapy in treating overall EP. However, whether the conclusion varies for tubal and nontubal EP should be further confirmed. Besides, 5-FU was used at an indicated dose in the current study, and we still do not know whether optimal synergistic effect could be observed in treatment efficiency of EP when changing 5-FU dosage or 5-FU/MTX ratio according to the individual &#x003b2;-HCG level.</p><p>Our study compared the treatment efficiency of UAE and infusion with sole MTX, or MTX combined with 5-FU, in treating ectopic pregnancies. The results showed that UAE and concomitant local infusion of MTX was effective in addressing ectopic pregnancies with the intention to preserve fertility. Moreover, intrauterine arterial embolization and infusion of MTX combined with 5-FU had comparable effects to UAE with sole MTX. However, the extra addition of 5-FU may increase the risk of adverse effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: &#x003b2;-HCG = &#x003b2;-human chorionic gonadotropin, 5-FU = 5-fluorouracil, ANOVA = analysis of variance, CSP = cesarean scar pregnancy, EP = ectopic pregnancy, IQR = interquartile range, MTX = methotrexate, UACE = uterine artery chemoembolization, UAE = uterine artery embolization.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Helmy</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Pablik</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
