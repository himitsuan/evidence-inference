An exercise-based intervention was conducted three times/week for 16&#x000a0;weeks from 16-20 to 32-36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation. The main outcomes were preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. Gestational age was calculated based on several parameters, including routine ultrassounds and/or last menstrual period and categorized as &#x0003c;&#x02009;37&#x000a0;weeks and &#x02265;&#x02009;37&#x000a0;weeks for evaluation of preterm birth. Pre-eclampsia was self-reported. Secondary outcomes were gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, birth weight, infant length, and head circumference. Analyses were performed by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (70% of the 48 planned exercise sessions). Odds ratio were derived using unconditional logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The IG and CG did not differ at baseline regarding their mean age (27.2&#x000a0;years&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.3 vs. 27.1&#x000a0;years&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7) and mean pre-pregnancy body mass index (25.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9 vs. 25.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

A total of 594 participants (IG:198; CG: 396) were included in the ITT and 479 (IG: 83; CG: 396) were included in the per protocol analyses. There were no significant differences in the incidence of preterm birth and pre-eclampsia between groups in the ITT and per protocol analysis. There were also no differences between the two groups in mean gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, birth weight, infant length, and head circumference.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">While the RCT did not support the benefits of exercise performed during pregnancy on preeclampsia and preterm birth, the exercise program also did not present adverse impacts on newborn health.

A 2014 review of physical activity guidelines during pregnancy around the world indicated universal support of moderate-intensity physical activity during uncomplicated pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with uncomplicated pregnancies should engage in moderate intensity exercise 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min/day on most or all days of the week during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The United States Department of Health and Human Services recommends that women with an apparently healthy pregnancy should accumulate at least 150&#x000a0;min/ week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity during both pregnancy and postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), counselling about keeping physically active during pregnancy is recommended for pregnant women to stay healthy and to prevent excessive gestational weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite available evidence supporting the promotion of antenatal physical activity to bring health benefits for both mother and child, the most effective way to prevent some maternal and fetal outcomes is still unclear. Initial studies in the area were concerned about the potential risks of exercise on newborn health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These hypotheses have not been proven over time but concerns about the safety of exercise during pregnancy seem to remain.</p><p id="Par17">Previous reviews and meta-analyses summarized the associations of physical activity during pregnancy with specific maternal and child health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Observational studies showed positive associations between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and maternal&#x02013;child health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], while most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported no associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis including only RCTs indicated exercise programs during pregnancy prevented excessive weight gain, gestational diabetes, and newborn&#x02019;s large-for-gestational age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. No effects of exercise during pregnancy on pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, or birth weight were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Key limitations of previous RCTs include small sample size, self-selection, high dropout rates, and low adherence to the exercise protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, many interventions on physical activity and maternal-child-health are based only on counseling strategies and information about physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum, and do not include exercise sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 2014, a RCT nested in the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort study was planned with a number of strategies to address the limitations identified in prior studies. The main reason for conducting this trial in Brazil is the fact that LTPA among Brazilian women is associated with socioeconomic factors and other characteristics not easily controlled during statistical analyses in merely observational studies. Moreover, few experimental studies have been carried out to evaluate these associations in low or middle income countries with large population-based samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a supervised exercise-based intervention performed from 16-20 to 32-36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation to prevent maternal (gestational diabetes, excessive weight gain, and pre-eclampsia) and newborn (preterm birth, and low birth weight) negative health outcomes assessed in a Brazilian population-based cohort study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design and setting</title><p id="Par19">The PAMELA (Physical Activity for Mothers Enrolled in Longitudinal Analysis) trial is a randomized controlled trial nested into the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. Eligible pregnant women were sampled from the antenatal phase of the 2015 Cohort, a population-based cohort study of all births from mothers living in the urban area of the city of Pelotas, Brazil. The 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study recruited pregnant women from all health facilities offering antenatal care (public and private) including clinical laboratories, ultrasound clinics, basic health units, hospitals, clinics/polyclinics, colleges and private doctor offices in the city of Pelotas. Pregnant women with an expected delivery date from January 1<sup>st</sup> 2015 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015 were eligible for the cohort. Participants of the antenatal phase of the cohort study were recruited to enroll the RCT prior to 20&#x000a0;weeks of gestation starting in April 2014 and ending in October 2015, by a standard phone contact. In order to achieve the required sample size, recruitment was extended until March 2016, using the same eligibility criteria, and recruited an additional sample of 41 pregnant women.</p><p id="Par20">The trial protocol and the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study were submitted to the Physical Education School and Medical School Ethics Committee and were approved under the numbers 649.244 and 522.064, respectively.

Participants were then assigned to either an exercise or control group using a computerized random-number generator. The randomization process occurred in blocks of nine pregnant women. Each block resulted in the allocation of three women for the intervention and six women for the control group, ensuring a recruitment balance of 1:2 throughout the study. We used 2 controls to 1 case in order to increase precision and statistical power of detecting a statistically significant difference if such a difference exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We chose to increase the number of individuals in the control group instead of individuals in the intervention group given the high costs associated with the intervention.</p><p id="Par23">The nature of this trial meant that participants and staff were not masked to the type of intervention. However, the principal researcher was not involved in the exercise training and analyses were performed blinded for group allocation. Also, the staff involved with exercise intervention or outcome assessments had no influence on the randomization procedure. The assessors of the primary study outcomes were blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par24">The exercise training program started between 16 and 20&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation and was continued for at least 16&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Women in the intervention group received a structured, individually supervised, moderate-intensity exercise program for 1 hour 3 days/week planned according to the ACOG recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Each session involved warm-up, aerobic activities (treadmill or stationary bike), strength training (dumbbells, machines or elastic bands), and stretching exercises. The exercise intensity was measured according to each woman&#x02019;s perceived effort (within the range of 12 to 14 on the Borg Scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A mean of 48 training sessions were planned for each participant. The training sessions were grouped into three stages. The first stage (week 1 to 4) began with 5&#x000a0;min warm-up period, 15&#x000a0;min aerobic exercise, 35&#x000a0;min strength training/floor exercises (sets: 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;12 repetitions), and 5&#x000a0;min stretching.

Adherence to the exercise sessions was controlled by the instructors, and registered in a personal training diary. Strategies such as door-to-door transportation and a kit, containing a t-shirt, running tights, and running shoes, were offered to participants to improve adherence. Both groups received study t-shirts and laboratory results around 10&#x000a0;days after baseline data collection. To be considered adherent to the intervention, women must have attended at least 34 of 48 (70%) of the prescribed workout sessions. Adherence criteria was verified by checking the percentage of supervised exercise sessions completed by each participant, defined as the number of sessions attended from the start of the trial up to the moment that participants decided to stop (before or after 16-weeks), divided by the minimum number of supervised exercise sessions prescribed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Assessesments</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Baseline measures</title><p id="Par28">After enrollment, women were invited to visit the Epidemiological Research Center to collect baseline data. The baseline data was collected prior to 20&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation and included blood and urine sampling, anthropometry (weight and height), blood pressure measurement, lung function, and back pain tests. Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) was measured twice after 2&#x000a0;min of seated rest using a sphygmomanometer model UM080. The same assessments were repeated at eight and 16&#x000a0;weeks after baseline. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected at the hospital up to 48&#x000a0;h after delivery via face-to-face interviews by trained staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p id="Par29">The primary outcomes were preterm birth and pre-eclampsia.

Height was measured using a tape measure fixed to the wall and a moveable head board at baseline only. Gestational weight gain was calculated in two ways: (1) using weight measured at baseline subtracted by weight measured at the last visit to the clinic, 16&#x000a0;weeks after baseline; and (2) assessed following the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] based on pre-pregnancy BMI and total gestational weight gain measured by self-reported and collected at the hospital up to 48&#x000a0;h after delivery.

Baseline characteristics were presented using descriptive statistics to compare both groups. Group-mean differences by covariates were analyzed using the Student&#x02019;s t-test (mean, SD) for continuous variables or the chi-squared test for categorical variables (<italic>n</italic>, %). Normality of continuous variables were checked graphically using histograms and by mean, median, skewness, and kurtosis parameters. All continuous variables presented symmetric distribution. The offspring characteristics (birth weight, lengh and head circunference) were also analyzed by Z-scores. Due to the similarity of the results between the Z-scores and mean values of the offspring characteristics, we chose to present the results in means and standard deviations for a better interpretation. Odds ratios were derived using unconditional logistic regression. Statistical significance was assessed using 95% confidence intervals. All the analyses were performed using the software Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, US).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Results</title><p id="Par35">From a total of 2902 assessed for eligibility, 1341 pregnant women did not meet inclusion criteria and 963 declined to participate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par42">To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first RCTs to apply a supervised exercise program evaluating a large number of maternal and neonatal outcomes within the same study in a middle income country. The present report indicates that supervised regular, moderate-to-vigorous exercise program performed three times/week did not support the benefits of exercise performed during pregnancy on maternal and newborn health outcomes evaluated.</p><p id="Par43">The strengths of our study were the use of a RCT design, conducted by certified professionals in a supervised setting. The participants&#x02019; adherence to the exercise protocol was monitored both by the instructors and via recordings in a training diary. The intervention was planned according to the ACOG recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, some limitations should be noted. First, besides several strategies to keep adherence to the exercise program (i.e., door-to-door transportation, fitness clothes to the intervention group, printed laboratory results from the blood and urine samples, and T-shirts of the trial for all participants), we had a higher number of dropouts in the intervention group and lower adherence to the protocol. Higher maternal age and schooling and not smoking during pregnancy were positively associated with adherence to the exercise intervention. Also, women with lower schooling and without a paid job during pregnancy were more likely to be lost to follow-up (data not show). However, the sample that was included in the ITT analysis did not present differences in baseline characteristics between intervention and control groups. The dropouts may have underpowered our analysis. Secondly, we did not record information about nutritional intake, although all women were exposed to the same standard care. Lack information on medical history of preeclampsia (as well timing in pregnancy) and gestational diabetes in prior pregnancy may be also consider limitations of our study. Preeclampsia was based on self-report and it might lead to misclassification. Thirdly, the timing of the intervention (lasting until 32-36&#x000a0;weeks) overlapped with the typical onset of preeclampsia and early preterm birth. However, we decided to finish the intervention at this time to prevent dropouts since involvement in physical activity declines in the final period of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Fourthly, our eligibility criteria may have been too rigorous which resulted in an extremely healthy population. Intragroup homogeneity may have made it difficult to find an effect of exercise among very healthy groups in a 16-week training window.</p><p id="Par44">The effect of exercise during pregnancy on newborn&#x02019;s outcomes is still unclear. Despite contrary evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], pregnant women are often encouraged to decrease their levels of physical activity or even quit because of the belief that exercise may reduce placental circulation and, consequently, increase the risk of disorders such as miscarriages, preterm deliveries, and intrauterine growth retardation. However, results from 17 previous trials evaluating exercise during pregnancy and gestational age have showed no difference between exercise and control groups in mean of gestational age at delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, our findings showed that regular exercise did not affect the mean gestational age when comparing the control and intervention groups. Although several cohort studies of LTPA suggest a reduction in the risk of preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we did not find differences between intervention and control groups.</p><p id="Par45">This is one of very few RCTs investigating the effect of a supervised structured exercise program on preeclampsia. Previous meta-analyses have shown that exercise is a protective factor for hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Given that preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease share several risk factors, it has been hypothesized that physical activity may also protect against preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but epidemiologic studies have not shown consistent results. According to the a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], only three RCTs were conducted to evaluate the effect of exercise on development of preeclampsia. In our study, we did not find association between an exercise program during pregnancy and preeclampsia. Similar results were found in previous RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Aune et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven cohort and four case&#x02013;control studies, and found an inverse association between physical activity and preeclampsia. However, little robust evidence from randomized controlled trials is available to confirm these findings.</p><p id="Par46">In terms of GDM, the results from previous RCTs are controversial. A recent review conducted by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed a protective effect of exercise programs during pregnancy on the development of GDM when evaluating 11 RCTs, but the same was not observed in the meta-analysis of six RCTs conducted by Yin et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The inverse association between exercise and development of GDM is biologically plausible. The main hypothesis is that exercise-induced improvements on glucose metabolism may be due to increases in GLUT4, direct effects on oxidative stress and endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Also, exercise has an indirect and potentially more long-term role in glucose tolerance through changes in body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, in this trial there was no significant difference in the incidence of developing gestational diabetes between the intervention and control groups.</p><p id="Par47">Most of the intervention studies that have evaluated the role of exercise in the prevention of gestational weight gain have found an inverse association between physical exercise during pregnancy and gestational weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that women who participated in the intervention gained on average 1&#x000a0;kg less than women in the standard care group, but this difference was not significant, probably because we did not have statistic power to find a difference for this variable. Moreover, we did not find differences in excessive gestational weight gain according to the IOM 2009 guidelines in both ITT and per protocol analyses. These findings contrast with the results of an intervention conducted by Ruiz et al. (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] that found women in the intervention group submitted to light- to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercises were less likely to gain weight above the IOM recommendations compared with those in the standard care group. Given the negative consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] that have been associated between excessive gestational weight gain and maternal-child health outcomes, gestational weight management strategies should be considered high priority.</p><p id="Par48">Regarding birth weight, a recent meta-analysis with 22 trials evaluated the effect of exercise interventions on birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. No association was found regarding the effect of exercise on average birth weight. Our results support these findings. The clinical importance of a small reduction in mean birth weight is questionable, and it may be more relevant if maternal exercise primarily decreased the number of newborns with macrosomia, which may reduce the risk of prolonged labor and fetal hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">High compliance in intervention studies with pregnant women remains a challenge. Only 86 women (40.4%) reached our criterion of adherence to the protocol. Stafne et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] found a similar result when reported that adherence to protocol (exercising 3 days per week or more at moderate to high intensity) in their study was 55% at follow-up at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation. Non-adherence to prescribed behavior changes can substantially diminish the long-term benefits of health promotion programs. In our study, we had a high number of dropouts. One of the main reasons was medical advice to discontinue exercise. Previous studies have shown that pregnant women do seek advice about physical activity; however only 28.1% reported to be encouraged from health providers in prenatal care to physical activity practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Pregnant women whose health providers discussed exercise were more likely to report exercise during pregnancy, especially during late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Given that physical activity advice during prenatal care may be a predictor of exercise during pregnancy, these professionals have an essential role in the encouragement and support of these women to be physically active during pregnancy. It is essential that health professionals are conscious of current recommendations and benefits of physical activities during pregnancy. It is important to explore and understand all PAbarriers and facilitators when designing antenatal PA interventions in order to uncover the reasons for non-adherence and non-engagement with the behaviour, as well as determining what type of intervention would be acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">This study did not support the benefits of exercise performed during pregnancy on preeclampsia, weight gain and gestational diabetes. The results of this RCT showed that an exercise program did not find adverse impact on maternal-child health. However, the results of our study should be interpreted with caution given lack of statistical power and low compliance. Although the effectiveness of physical exercise programs on improving maternal and neonatal outcomes has been studied, the impact of physical activity on preeclampsia and birth weight is lacking. High-quality RCTs are still necessary to clarify the optimal frequency, type, duration and intensity of physical exercise required for beneficial health outcomes during pregnancy. Additional research is needed, in particular, to study the effects of physical exercise on newborn&#x02019;s outcomes. This is an important area that should be explored further in future research. Studies on the effect of adherence strategies focusing in specific subgroups to enhance motivation for regular participation in exercise during pregnancy are also warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
