Primary end points were the nature, incidence, and severity of adverse events (AEs).

This supports the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of rituximab may be limited by the survival or re&#x02010;expansion of autoreactive B&#x02010;lineage cells supported by BLyS.

The study comprised a 7&#x02010;week rituximab treatment period, a 25&#x02010;week atacicept/placebo treatment period, and a 32&#x02010;week posttreatment followup period. In the rituximab period, all patients received two 1000&#x02010;mg doses of rituximab by intravenous infusion, 2 weeks apart (weeks 1 and 3). At week 7 (after 28 days without treatment), patients were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneous atacicept at a dose of 150 mg or placebo, once weekly for 25 weeks. Randomization was stratified by rheumatoid factor (RF) status (positive or negative) and country, and an interactive voice response system was used to allocate treatment kit numbers.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards and independent Ethics Committees at the participating institutions, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, and any local requirements.

AEs were common (driven mainly by injection&#x02010;site reactions and infections), were mostly mild or moderate, and occurred with a similar frequency in both the active treatment and placebo groups.</p><p>SAEs occurred in 8 patients during the study: 2 in the treatment period, 1 during the treatment and followup periods, and 5 during followup. The SAEs that occurred during followup were observed in patients who had received atacicept. There were, however, no notable trends in the types of SAEs that emerged, and all except one (focal demyelination/glioma) resolved. This patient developed a focal demyelination and demonstrated multifocal changes in the white matter on MRI, which did not progress over a 6&#x02010;month period, and symptoms did not progress over 4 years of followup.</p><p>The etiology of the white matter lesions identified by MRI in this patient is not clear, although the changes are consistent with a demyelinating process and ischemic changes. It should be noted that demyelination due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) following rituximab treatment in RA patients, leading to estimates of increased risk in the order of 1 per 25,000 patients treated, has been reported in the literature <xref rid="art39262-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. Rituximab&#x02010;induced depletion of B cells has been suggested to permit the reactivation of JC virus (JCV), which is responsible for PML <xref rid="art39262-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. However, the JCV status of the patients in the present study was not investigated. In a clinical trial of patients with multiple sclerosis, atacicept treatment was associated with exacerbation of the disease. However, there have been no new diagnoses of demyelinating processes reported in any other atacicept clinical trial. It is not possible to tell from this small pilot study whether atacicept contributed to the demyelination event in this patient. The investigator, however, considered the focal demyelination, suspected focal glioma, and multifocal changes in the white matter to be either unrelated or unlikely to be related to the study medication. RA itself was reported as an alternative explanation for this SAE.</p><p>Infection&#x02010;related AEs observed in this study were mostly infections that are commonly encountered, consistent with previous reports <xref rid="art39262-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. The infection rate was slightly higher than that previously reported to be associated with treatment with atacicept (44% in the present study versus 34&#x02013;35% in prior studies [15,20]), but was still lower than that in patients treated with rituximab alone (66.7%). Rituximab re&#x02010;treatment has been associated with a reported rate of infection of 50&#x02013;60% in clinical trials <xref rid="art39262-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. Thus, re&#x02010;treatment with rituximab may be contributing to the higher infection rate seen in patients also treated with atacicept. Importantly, no serious infections were reported among atacicept&#x02010;treated patients during the treatment period, despite the clear effect of atacicept on B cell levels established in other clinical trials of atacicept in RA patients; one event of severe gastroenteritis occurred 4 months after treatment in a patient who had recently visited Thailand.</p><p>The percentage of patients who withdrew due to AEs was twice as high with atacicept as with placebo. Injection&#x02010;site reactions with atacicept were more frequent than previously reported (72.2% in the present study versus 10&#x02013;11% in prior studies [19,20]), and the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was also higher in atacicept&#x02010;treated patients (50.0%) than in placebo&#x02010;treated patients (22.2%). The reasons for this remain unclear; the small sample size could have led to chance results, or rituximab could have increased hypersensitivity to atacicept.</p><p>As in other phase I and phase II trials <xref rid="art39262-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, atacicept was not associated with an increased rate of total infection, despite its Ig&#x02010;lowering effects. A small reduction in antibody titers was observed. The reduction in protective titers was, however, not greater than the reduction in total IgG levels. There was no apparent correlation between patients with infections and those with the lowest mean levels of each Ig subclass (data not shown).</p><p>Atacicept demonstrated marked biologic activity, as indicated by the decreases in the ESR, B cell subset counts, and concentrations of Ig subclasses and RF in atacicept&#x02010;treated patients compared to placebo&#x02010;treated patients. The magnitude and pattern of the decrease in total Ig levels following treatment with rituximab and atacicept were similar to those observed in previous RA trials with atacicept alone <xref rid="art39262-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. Consistent with those earlier studies, atacicept&#x02010;associated reductions in the ESR were greater than the reductions in the CRP level, which may be attributed to the reduction in total Ig levels associated with atacicept <xref rid="art39262-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. As expected, B cell subsets in the peripheral blood were completely depleted by rituximab, but there was no indication that atacicept delayed the recovery of B cell populations. In some cases, particularly for mature B cells, recovery was quicker following atacicept treatment compared to placebo treatment. Interpretation of these data is, however, limited by a high degree of interindividual variability, the small study size, very low starting numbers of lymphocyte cell populations (typically &#x0003c;10 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, with a resolution of 1 cell/mm<sup>3</sup>), and a between&#x02010;group difference in the proportion of patients who received rituximab re&#x02010;treatment during followup, which was numerically higher in the placebo group.</p><p>The mechanisms of action of rituximab and atacicept on B cell populations are understood to be complementary, suggesting a potential for additive or synergistic clinical benefit following their combination <xref rid="art39262-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. However, no treatment benefit, as measured by the ACR response rates and DAS28, was observed following the addition of atacicept to rituximab re&#x02010;treatment in this study. Published phase II studies of atacicept in RA have previously demonstrated only modest clinical effects despite considerable biologic activity <xref rid="art39262-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. The reasons for this disparity remain unclear. BLyS and APRIL may regulate both B cell and T cell function, and could have both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory activities in RA <xref rid="art39262-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. The possibility also exists that atacicept did not sufficiently block BLyS and APRIL locally in the synovium, leading to insufficient local reduction of B cells and plasma cells. In addition, it is possible that sequential therapy that starts with atacicept first, in order to mobilize memory B cells from niche compartments, followed by rituximab could have higher therapeutic benefit.</p><p>In this study, the rates of clinical response to rituximab were lower than those previously reported <xref rid="art39262-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="art39262-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Patients in other studies had not been previously treated with rituximab at baseline, and thus may have had a larger response than those being re&#x02010;treated in the present study. Patients in this study may have experienced some residual therapeutic effect, meaning that re&#x02010;treatment with rituximab did not lower the CRP level as much as initial treatment.</p><p>The number of patients who were re&#x02010;treated with rituximab was lower in the atacicept group compared to the placebo group; thus, there is a possibility that atacicept treatment was associated with a more persistent response. Indeed, this was the original hypothesis that led to this trial. Unfortunately, no other measured outcome provides independent support for this hypothesis, and so it remains an intriguing possibility, at best. The study limitations included the small numbers of patients in each group, and the short duration of this pilot study.</p><p>In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrated that administering atacicept following rituximab re&#x02010;treatment presented no new safety concerns and was associated with an AE profile consistent with that reported previously for atacicept in phase II studies. Atacicept exerted clear biologic effects, but no additional clinical benefit was observed. Any evidence of an effect of atacicept on delayed B cell re&#x02010;expansion following rituximab&#x02010;mediated depletion could not be evaluated, since there was virtually no recovery of B cells in the placebo group during the followup period. These findings, therefore, do not suggest that the combination of atacicept and rituximab should be pursued as a therapeutic option for patients with RA.</p></sec><sec id="art39262-sec-0022"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
