There is evidence to suggest that these exaggerated elevations in triglycerides are linked to impairment of endothelial function, characterized by an imbalance between the actions of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction has not been fully clarified, reduced nitric oxide (NO) and increased oxidative stress are important contributors to the reduction of the vasodilatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Endothelial dysfunction induced by PPL is considered an early and reversible predictor of atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As humans spend a considerable part of the day in a postprandial state, interventions that can reduce the magnitude and duration of this metabolic state may be beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><p id="Par8">Exercise training prior to high-fat meal ingestion has been shown to have an attenuating effect on postprandial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the same line, studies have reported that energy expenditure through prior exercise is related to the magnitude of this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Mestek et al. reported, however, that isocaloric sessions before a meal mitigate PPL independently of the intensity of the exercise session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By contrast, other studies showed that the magnitude of PPL was influenced by prior exercise intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, the effects of the intensity of the exercise undertaken on postprandial response remain contentious.</p><p id="Par9">With regard to postprandial endothelial function, evidence has shown that a single bout of exercise prior to HFM consumption improves fasting and postprandial endothelial function compared with a resting control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been reported that acute moderate- and high-intensity exercise has transient benefits for macrovascular endothelial function in both fasting and postprandial states, and that these effects may be due to the improvement in antioxidant status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the limited prior studies carried out to investigate the effects of exercise intensity have produced inconsistent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The aforementioned studies investigating the protective effects of exercise performed a few hours before consumption of an HFM on postprandial metabolism and endothelial function have focused on the acute effects of exercise. Thus, although a 12-week training program has been established as a protocol to assess the chronic effects of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the potential impact on postprandial metabolism and vascular function after HFM have not been previously investigated. A recent narrative review summarized the current literature on the possible contributions of medium- to long-term physical training to the reduction of the postprandial response, concluding that the data are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on cardio-metabolic health showed that performing even a short period (&#x0223c;4&#x000a0;min) of high-intensity exercise has greater benefits than moderate-intensity exercise in terms of cardiometabolic risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Considering that most adults do not meet the public health recommendations of at least 150&#x000a0;min per week of moderate-intensity exercise and also that habitual physical activity declines during middle age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], it is of special interest to identify how much high-intensity exercise is needed to optimize vascular function in adulthood.</p><p id="Par12">Thus, we Given the above, we hypothesized that medium-term exercise could attenuate the postprandial decrement in metabolism and endothelial function and that this effect would differ according to exercise intensity. On this basis, we aimed to determine the effects of a 12-week high-intensity training (HIT) or a moderate continuous training (MCT) program on postprandial metabolism and vascular function and arterial stiffness after HFM ingestion in healthy, inactive Latin-American adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par13">Details of the study design and methods of the primary HIT-Heart Study trial have been described elsewhere (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> ID: NCT02738385; April 14th, 2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Inter-assay reproducibility (coefficients of variation) was determined via ten replicate analyses of five plasma pools over 15&#x000a0;days and was shown to be 2.0, 3.2, 2.6 and 1.5% for total cholesterol, HDL-c, triglycerides and serum glucose, respectively.

Vascular function and arterial stiffness, as measured by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the augmentation index (AIx) were measured. FMD was measured as described in previous studies from our group in the Colombian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] using the guidelines reported by Atkinson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The same operator performed all Doppler ultrasound (Mindray M-9&#x000ae; DS USA; Mahwah, NJ) examinations using a 7.5-MHz linear array probe. Ultrasound imaging of the brachial artery was performed with the subjects in the supine position after 15&#x000a0;min of rest, with the arm abducted approximately 80&#x000b0; from the body and the forearm supinated. The ultrasound probe was positioned with a 60&#x000b0; insonation angle in a longitudinal plane at a site 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;cm proximal to the antecubital fossa to visualize the anterior and posterior lumen-intima interfaces, to measure diameter and central flow velocity (pulsed Doppler). After the baseline images were recorded, a blood pressure cuff, positioned on the arm, was inflated to 200&#x000a0;mmHg for 5&#x000a0;min; to assess FMD, images were acquired continuously for 3&#x000a0;min after cuff deflation, during the reactive hyperemia period. Brachial artery diameter recording was restarted at least 30&#x000a0;s before cuff deflation and continued for 3&#x000a0;min thereafter. The peak artery diameter and the time to reach this peak after cuff deflation were recorded. Images were recorded on a DVD for subsequent measurements by one observer blinded to the study design. FMD was calculated as the percent rise of peak diameter from the preceding baseline diameter and was measured every 1&#x000a0;min after deflation for 3&#x000a0;min. Normalized brachial artery FMD (FMDn) was calculated according to the allometric relationship between the baseline artery diameter and the peak diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The intra-session coefficient of variation was &#x02264;1% for the baseline diameter. Reliability was estimated by intra-class correlation coefficients based on four baseline measurements (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8 subjects), yielding values of 0.91 for baseline diameter and 0.83 for FMD (our own data). The technical error of measurement was 1.23% for baseline diameter, 1.77% for maximum diameter and 20% for %FMD.</p><p id="Par23">The PWV was measured by analyzing the oscillometric pressure curves registered from the upper arm. Patient data and the measured distance between the jugulum and the symphysis were registered in an arteriographic computer program (Arteriograph Software v.1.9.9.2; TensioMed, Budapest, Hungary). A tape measure was used to measure the distance between the jugulum and the symphysis, the aortic distance. The cuff was placed on the patient&#x02019;s upper arm and connected to the device. The algorithm measuring blood pressure in the arteriography device has been previously validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. PWV was calculated as the jugulum-to-symphysis distance (m) divided by one-half of the return time (return time/2) (s). For PWV measurements, the two recordings with the lowest standard deviations were chosen. The standard deviation was calculated on the basis of all heartbeats during a period of 8&#x02009;s.</p><p id="Par24">The AIx was calculated as the ratio of the difference between the systolic peaks of the first pulse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and second pulse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] relative to the central pulse pressure, expressed as a percentage [(pulse 2 - pulse 1/central pulse pressure)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100]. Thus, it provides the brachial/aortic AIx without applying a transfer function. The R value, used as an estimate of the measurement errors for the repeated measurements between two sessions, was low for the arteriograph (1.18&#x000a0;m&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par25">To retain the data of all randomly allocated participants, we performed an intention-to-treat analysis (all randomly assigned patients). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify data distribution normality. Once it was confirmed that the sample data satisfied the normality assumption, statistical analyses relevant to our main research interests were conducted. T-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables were used to investigate any possible differences in baseline characteristics between the two conditions (HIT and MCT). We used a generalized linear model to analyze the influence of the different training protocols on biochemical and vascular function outcomes with repeated measures [2 (group)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 (test time)]. The area under the curve (AUC), expressed in arbitrary units (au) via the trapezoidal method, was calculated and used to analyze the response to the training protocols. The effect of training on AUC measures was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. Significant differences in AUC from 0 to 240&#x000a0;min after the HFM following 12&#x000a0;weeks of HIT or MCT were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance. A criterion alpha level of <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

The main finding of this study is that a 12-week regimen of HIT reduces glucose concentrations and exerts greater post-HFM endothelial function than MCT, supporting the idea that the effect of chronic exercise on postprandial response is dependent on exercise intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Recent evidence has shown that acute exercise increases FMD following HFM consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that medium-term exercise training prevents the decline in FMD induced by PPL, supporting the protective effect of regular exercise on vascular function. This is clinically relevant since endothelial function is an independent risk factor of CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, the higher AUC values of FMD in the HIT group after HFM (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009) indicates that this regimen may provide major vascular benefits in inactive adults.</p><p id="Par34">In agreement with our results, previous studies focusing on the effect of acute exercise demonstrated that FMD remained greater after HFM consumption following a single bout of HIT as compared with MCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, although it is of special interest to calculate incremental AUC values drawn from hourly measurements up to 4&#x000a0;h using the trapezoid rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], most previous studies have not included these data. In contrast to our present findings, a recent study conducted in 11 physically active young men reported that FMD response did not differ between the two conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The differences in training status between this study population (physically active) and our study cohort (inactive) might explain the inconsistent findings, since it has been shown that FMD responses after HFM consumption may differ between active and inactive subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, based on our results and previous research, it can be hypothesized that exercise attenuates the negative effects of HFM consumption on endothelial cell function in an inactive population. Further studies investigating the mechano-sensory mechanisms contributing to the effect of exercise on vascular function as well as possible interactions among molecular pathways are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The mechanism by which chronic exercise training can modulate postprandial endothelial function is unclear. Regular exercise has been proposed to decrease PPL and therefore reduce postprandial oxidative stress by maintaining low lipoprotein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. An alternative mechanistic explanation is that regular exercise might increase antioxidant capacity, leading to maintenance of endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Indeed, a substantial increase in exercise intensity has been linked to greater protection of vascular function against oxidative stress, supporting the possibility that HIT might trigger larger vascular effects at the cellular and molecular levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Likewise, exercise might exert a positive effect on endothelial function by stimulating the production and bioavailability of NO, as physical activity induces the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), increases the capacity of the cellular antioxidant system and diminishes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that a single session of exercise increased circulating and intramuscular free radical levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which may lead to inactivation of NO with consequences for endothelium-mediated vasodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It seems that acute exercise mediates the oxidant-antioxidant balance in favor of antioxidants, resulting in the maintenance of vascular function, and a similar effect is observed from the co-ingestion of antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the effects of different intensities of exercise on postprandial FMD are related to changes in antioxidant status.</p><p id="Par36">We also found that medium-term HIT decreased the glucose response over the postprandial observation period by 10% compared with MCT (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008), indicating that the 7magnitude of postprandial glucose response was dependent on exercise intensity. This result contrasts with previous reports that failed to find differences between the two training protocols regarding postprandial glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, it should be noted that these studies only examined the effect of postprandial glucose level after acute exercise. Thus, it is possible that only medium or long-term training has a significant effect on postprandial glucose response.</p><p id="Par37">We found similar total cholesterol, HDL-c and triglyceride responses after HFM consumption in both training regimens, suggesting that medium-term exercise training might not play an important role in the postprandial decrement in lipid responses. In previous studies focusing on acute exercise, significant differences between HIT and MCT were found for triglycerides, but not for total cholesterol or HDL levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this context, results from preliminary studies have suggested that the positive effect of exercise training on PPL might be short lived, demonstrating variations in the effect sizes for exercise training performed within 24&#x000a0;h prior to HFM ingestion and for exercise training performed more than 24&#x000a0;h pre-prandial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that postprandial triglyceride response might be short lived, showing a relevant effect only after acute exercise.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par38">This study has some limitations. Due to the high sensitivity of endothelium to nutritional changes, it would be ideal to administer isocaloric meals to participants at least three days before the measurement of endothelial function. In this study, although diet was not controlled, a dietician provided an individualized iso-energetic nutrition intervention plan. Second, since endothelial function is well known to be affected by age and training status and our study cohort comprised healthy, inactive mature adults, our findings may not be generalizable to other populations with different characteristics. A final possible limitation is that we did not examine other factors such as antioxidant status, NO, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels that might ameliorate postprandial response, and this should be studied in future research.</p><p id="Par39">The main strength of our study is that, to our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial on the effect of exercise-training intensity on biochemical parameters and endothelial functional responses to HFM consumption in inactive adults from the Latin-American population. In addition, we provide measurements of these PPL responses at multiple time points to better describe their time course after chronic exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">In summary, the novel finding of this study was that medium-term supervised physical training may mitigate endothelial dysfunction and glucose response induced by PPL. Exercise intensity seems to play an important role in these protective effects, suggesting that HIT might be the more effective in reducing postprandial glucose levels and attenuating vascular impairments. Therefore, medium-term HIT is an effective strategy to reduce CVD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
