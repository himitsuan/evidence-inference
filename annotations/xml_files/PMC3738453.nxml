Energy utilization; VO<sub>2</sub> and RER at 80% maximal heart rate (MHR), was evaluated twice; the first test for baseline and the second for supplemented caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee (Instant freeze dried decaffeinated coffee; Expressor, Thailand) or no supplement (control). For biochemistry laboratories, glucose, lipid oxidation, caffeine, and total antioxidant capacity were analyzed before and after supplementation.

A ratio of more than 1.0 indicates anaerobic metabolism, and a normal RER ratio should be in the range of 0.82&#x02013;0.85. Source utilization for exercise is delivered from carbohydrate, fat, or protein, and the presents with a RER ratio such as 1.0 (100% carbohydrate), 0.7 (% 100 fat), and 0.8 (100% protein), therefore shifting the RER at less than 1.0 represents the fat or protein was more metabolized as well as carbohydrate. This study showed similar results of changes in both VO<sub>2</sub> and RER in the caffeine group by a significant increase of VO<sub>2</sub> level between the first and second test and significantly reduced RER from the first to second test, whereas, no significant difference was shown in the control and decaffeinated group.

This study evaluated the total antioxidant capacity in blood before and after the submaximal exercise test. The results showed a non-significant difference within the three groups.</p><p>This study rechecked the level of caffeine in all groups and results confirmed that caffeine supplementation increased the caffeine level when compared to the control and decaffeinated group. Previous to this study period, blood caffeine in all groups could be detected from regular daily supplement, as there are many plants, vegetables and some beverages like tea and milk chocolate that also contain caffeine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-nmi-4-2011-065">2</xref> However, in the control and decaffeinated group, the caffeine level was reduced or absent after exercise, which was opposite to the caffeine group.</p><p>Many studies have explained the mechanisms of caffeine in physical performance, such as activation of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and effects on muscle contraction and across the membranes of nerves and muscle cells that have more powerful effects on steps other than metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-nmi-4-2011-065">29</xref> and also primary action on the central nervous system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-nmi-4-2011-065">30</xref> In order to improve endurance performance, another possible caffeine mechanism is releasing beta-endorphin after caffeine supplement at 6 mg/kg of body weight during two hours cycling at 65% VO<sub>2</sub> max.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-nmi-4-2011-065">7</xref> Current evidence suggests that the combined supplement between caffeine and creatine will improve physical performance better than caffeine on its own. For example, the study of Lee and coworker (2011) showed the significant benefit of creatine loading before caffeine supplementation in a peak power test on a sprinter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-nmi-4-2011-065">31</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be concluded that a moderate dose of caffeine is a well described ergogenic aid in various commercial products, as coffee powder shows enhancing effects on physical performance by increased VO<sub>2</sub> consumption and altered source of energy by releasing glucose and lipid oxidation in blood circulation. Although this study was performed in a small group of sedentary men, we found some interesting in practical useful on supplement or nutrition for improve exercise capacity or physical performance in sedentary subjects. But it also needs more confirmation on the dose and type of exercise that may have influence on the results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</bold></p><p>LD was responsible for the study designs, overseeing data collection, biochemical work, statistical analysis, and preparation of the manuscript.
