After a warm-up consisting of several sets of 6 to 10 repetitions using a light load, each participant attempted a single repetition with a load believed to be approximately 90% of his maximum. If the attempt was successful, weight was added, depending on the ease with which the single repetition was completed. If the attempt was not successful, weight was removed from the bar, and the exercise was repeated. Participants rested for a minimum of 3 minutes between maximal attempts. This procedure continued until the participant was unable to complete a single repetition through the full range of motion. Each participant's 1RM was defined as the heaviest load at which the exercise could be performed in proper form and was usually achieved in 3 to 5 attempts. Muscle endurance capacity was measured by maximal repetition test of bench press with 40% 1RM based on recent 1RM test. More than 24h after 1RM tests, subjects performed a warm-up consisting of several sets of 6 to 10 repetitions using a light load, and performed maximal effort repetition tests on the bench press to determine the repetitions and work volumes. Attempts of 1RM and maximal repetition test that did not meet the range of motion criterion for each exercise, as determined by the researcher, were discarded. The subjects were required to lower the bar to their chest before initiating concentric movement. Their grip widths were measured and recorded for later use.

We found that push-up training induced similar increases in muscle thickness of the triceps and pectoralis major to the 40% 1RM bench press. Similar strength gains were also observed in both groups. In present study, three site of ultrasonography measurement were performed as the indicator of muscle hypertrophy, however, muscle thickness is not a direct measurement for indicating muscle hypertrophy.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p id="p0085">The relationship between low-intensity bodyweight training and muscle hypertrophy has not been previously reported. The main finding of the present study was that low-intensity bodyweight training induced muscle hypertrophy, with increased in muscle thickness of the pectoralis major (push-up: 18.3%, bench press: 19.4%) and triceps (push-up: 9.5%, bench press: 10.3%). These results are consistent with a previous study<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> reporting that resistance training at 40%1RM resulted in a 24% increase in muscle thickness in untrained young men. In the present study, a 19.4% increase in muscle thickness of pectoralis major was observed in the bench-press group after an 8-week training session. The percent change of muscle thickness in the bench-press group was similar to that previously reported for 8-week training periods in untrained young men.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> A recent study suggested that low-load (30% 1RM) was as effective as high-load training (80% 1RM) for increasing muscle protein synthesis and signaling such as mTOR, p70S6K, and ERE1/2 in acute response of resistance exercise to volitional failure, and that 10-week leg extension resistance training protocols involving 3 sets of low-load (30% 1RM) or high-load (80% 1RM) intensity, but not 1 set of high-load intensity, induced muscle hypertrophy.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The present study extends this observation by showing that low-load resistance training to failure involving either bench press or push-up is also effective for muscle hypertrophy.</p><p id="p0090">Bench-press exercise is performed in a supine position on the bench. By contrast, the push-up is performed in a prone position and involves greater latissimus dorsi muscle activation.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> However, Calatayud et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> reported comparable levels of muscle activation during push-up and bench press and comparable muscle strength gains after 8 weeks of training with either exercise. Our results further suggest that push-up training induces similar muscle hypertrophy to bench-press training in the pectoralis major and triceps.</p><p id="p0095">A previous study indicated that push-up training on a stable or unstable surface does not provide significant improvement in muscle strength or endurance in 8 weeks.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Since each group performed three sets of 10 repetitions, the authors speculated that low training volume is a possible explanation for the lack of a statistically significant difference. On other hand, in the study by Calatayud et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> investigated push-up with elastic-band resistance to achieve the same muscle activation as 6RM bench press and found that 5 weeks of push-up exercise with similar EMG activity to bench press was effective for muscle strength gain (percent change of 1RM: 13%). In our study, push-ups and bench press performed at a similar intensity of 40%1RM induced comparable strength gain. Since subjects in our study performed exercises to failure, sufficient training volume was achieved. In our study, the percent changes of 1RM in push-up and bench press were 5% and 8%, respectively. Although the strength increase was lower than that reported by Calatayud et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> push-up training without any resistive staffs is effective for strength gain.</p><p id="p0100">Although we observed a significant 8% increase in biceps muscle thickness in the bench-press group, biceps muscle hypertrophy has not been previously reported in bench-press training.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Since certified training experts supervised their training, they performed the bench press exercise with a standard technique. It is a very low possibility, but they might perform the bench press with a wide or narrow grip. It induced greater biceps muscle activation compared to the middle grip,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> which may have led to biceps hypertrophy, but not in push up group in our study.</p><p id="p0105">We did not observe an improvement in performance parameters such as endurance and power output performance. In endurance performance, we measured maximal repetition test for bench press using relative intensity such as 40% 1RM based on recent 1RM test in present study. Nevertheless, 1RM strength following low intensity strength training increase in both groups and intensity was higher in post-test than pre-test. However, bench press group has higher % change in muscle endurance than push up group, because of specific adaptation to imposed demands. Improvement in power output parameters requires high intensity, high-velocity resistance training, and/or plyometric training.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> By contrast, we investigated low-intensity exercise with controlled movement and speed. Several authors examining the activation patterns of active muscles during variants of the push-up have reported altered electromyography levels. In addition, it may be necessary to consider not only the load of the exercise but also movement speed, such as by using plyometric push-ups, for improvements in physical performance.</p><p id="p0110">The following limitations may have effects on interpreting the results of the present study. First, we could not controlled dietary intakes and physical activity level in present study. Second, we could not measured latissimus dorsi thickness as well and might be there any differences here between groups. Third, the lack of an electromyography analysis and assessment of subjects of recreational noncompetitive exercisers prevent a comparison of our results with previous studies such as that of Calatayud et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> who reported that in trained subjects, 6RM bench press and push-up comparable gains in muscle strength, but no difference in muscle function or performance between low-intensity and high-intensity resistance training. Future studies are necessary to ascertain the effects of push-up and bench press with similar intensity on muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in highly trained subjects.</p><p id="p0115">In conclusion, push-up and bench-press exercise at 40%1RM over 8 weeks are similarly effective for increasing muscle thickness and strength gain. The intensity of push-up can be altered with the use of push-up variations, such as with knees bent or changing hand or foot elevation, the exercise can be performed at 40&#x02212;75% of body weight,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and it can be performed at higher loads by using an elastic band or weight plate on the back.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> These data and our present results can be used to quantify the approximate load as a percentage of body mass for the purpose of quantifying load and
