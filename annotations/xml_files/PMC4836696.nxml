Excess weight is associated with a range of health risks, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, joint pain, cancer and impaired fertility [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The need for safe and effective therapies to promote weight loss is high.</p><p>Obesity and associated metabolic diseases can be impacted by the interplay between specific nutrients, the composition of the gut microbiome, and gut peptide release [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Obesity is associated with changes in the gut microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153151.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and modulation of the gut microbiota can be effective in reducing metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153151.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gut peptide release is stimulated by specific nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as by metabolic by-products of the microbiota such as short chain fatty acid [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These gut peptides, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), and oxyntomodulin, have been shown to have direct effects on food intake, insulin secretion, glucose control, gut barrier integrity, and energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153151.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several exogenous GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been approved as therapies for T2D, including exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and albiglutide [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; liraglutide has also been approved for the treatment of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Investigational work into the potential therapeutic benefits of other peptides is ongoing [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The intersection of these research areas relating to gut peptides and nutrients led to a key question: Would nutritional agents that stimulate gut peptide release combined with a GLP-1R agonist or metformin, which itself stimulates endogenous release of GLP-1 [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], enhance weight loss and improve glucose metabolism? GSK2890457 (GSK457) was developed as a mixture of nutritional agents to address this question.</p><p>The components of GSK457 were identified based on extensive preliminary nonclinical work using the high-fat fed diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. Sixteen nutritional agents were screened initially alone and in combination with a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, referred to here as an exendin-4 AlbudAb. Preference was given to agents that (i) are generally recognized as safe (GRAS status), (ii) have no known safety issues, and (iii) stimulate gut peptide release in nonclinical and/or clinical studies. The single nutritional agents, as well as dual, triple and quadruple combinations were tested in the DIO mouse with weight loss as the primary endpoint.</p><p>GSK457 is a mixture of four ingredients: oligofructosaccharide (OFS), apple pectin, blackcurrant extract (BCE), and oleic acid in a ratio of 5:5:2:3. Each of these GRAS components is found in small amounts in a normal diet and they are used as food ingredients. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s016">S1 Materials and Methods</xref> for further information.)</p><p>The objective of our studies was to investigate the effects of GSK457 on weight and glucose metabolism in mouse models and humans. Here we report the remarkable weight loss and glucose lowering effects of GSK457 when administered alone and in combination with the exendin-4 AlbudAb in the DIO and <italic>db/db</italic> mouse models, respectively. While rodent models are frequently used to predict the effect of nutritional modulation in humans, here we report the lack of clinical translation when GSK457 was administered in combination with liraglutide or metformin to subjects with T2D.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153151.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the CONSORT flow diagram for the study.</p><fig id="pone.0153151.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153151.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0153151.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Nonclinical Materials and Methods</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> studies were conducted to investigate the effects of GSK457 alone and in combination with a long-acting GLP-1R agonist using the DIO C57BL6NTac mouse model of obesity and the <italic>db/db</italic> mouse model of T2D.</p><p>In the nonclinical studies, the GLP-1 receptor agonist co-administered with GSK457 was an exendin-4 AlbudAb.

The metformin-liraglutide substitution design was employed because a pre-study feasibility assessment had indicated that it would not be possible to enroll sufficient subjects taking liraglutide as their usual T2D medication.</p><p>Part C enrolled subjects with T2D who were stable on metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153151.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Subjects who fulfilled the Screening requirements began a 1-week Run-in &#x0201c;procedures familiarization&#x0201d; Period as in Part B during which they remained on their usual dose of metformin. The Run-in Period was followed by a 4-week Stabilization Period on their usual twice daily metformin therapy, and then the subjects were randomized to a 6-week Treatment Period during which they remained on metformin and received either GSK457 or placebo (2:1 allocation, respectively). Metformin concentrations were measured on Day 1 and Day 42 of the Treatment Period. Metformin pharmacokinetic data from Part A indicated a reduction in metformin area under the curve (AUC) when it was administered at the same time as GSK457. As a result, the protocol was amended, and subjects in Part C were instructed to take each metformin dose 1 hour prior to GSK457.</p><p>In all three Parts, to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events subjects started by taking 15 g of GSK457 daily, in 2 divided doses, and were up&#x02212;titrated to 30g daily (Day 4) and then to a maximum dose of 40 g daily at Day 7. Subjects unable to tolerate doses of 30 g or 40 g were permitted to reduce their dose to tolerated levels, with a minimum tolerated dose of 15 g required to remain in the study. A unit dose of 5 g of GSK457 consisted of three capsules of oleic acid and a separate sachet of powder for each of the three powder compounds. The powders were mixed by the subject into 12 oz of flavored (Mio<sup>&#x02122;</sup> pomegranate/berry flavoring) water in a shaker bottle and consumed just prior to breakfast and dinner. The capsules could be taken with this drink or separately with water. The matching placebo consisted of starch and microcrystalline cellulose in identical sachets and capsules.</p><p>In Parts B and C, there were additional clinic visits on Days 7, 14, and 28 for safety evaluations, potential modification of dose (Days 7 and 14), and dispensing of study medications. Subjects monitored their capillary blood glucose levels twice a day using a wireless-enabled glucometer and daily weights were monitored using a wireless enabled weighing instrument (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s018">S3 Materials and Methods</xref> for more information). Subjects were fed standardized meals (~2300 kcal; ~60% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 20% protein) on the pharmacodynamic profiling days.</p><p>In Parts A-C, there was a follow&#x02212;up visit approximately 14 days after discharge from the unit on Day 43.</p><p>Investigators, subjects and staff (except for the unblinded pharmacist) were blinded to the allocation of study treatment. The GlaxoSmithKline clinical study team had unblinded access to the data during the course of the study. When in the clinic, subjects were dosed separately from each other by a staff member to minimize the potential for unblinding.

When we commenced our studies of nutritional agents, there was already precedent for the activity of non-digestible fibers [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], oleic acid [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153151.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and polyphenols [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Building on this background, GSK457 was developed following a systematic assessment of 16 nutritional agents known to have metabolic effects, using weight loss in the DIO mouse as the pharmacodynamic readout. In the DIO mouse weight loss model we observed synergy when GSK457 was combined with the long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4 AlbudAb (weight loss of 30.8% after 28 days). Synergy was also observed when <italic>db/db</italic> mice were administered GSK457 and the exendin-4 AlbudAb in combination (glucose was reduced by 217 mg/dL and HbA1c was reduced by1.2%). The glycemic improvement was not explained by weight loss because pair-fed animals lost more weight without reductions of HbA1c or glucose. There is no clear explanation for the greater weight-loss observed in pair-fed animals, although untreated pair-fed animals may have blunted glucose utilization in their tissues whereas the treated animals may have better restoration of glucose utilization, tempering weight loss in the treatment group.</p><p>A number of potential mechanisms of action have been proposed for the components of GSK457. OFS and apple pectin are non-digestible fibers that are metabolized by bacteria to form short chain fatty acids that can interact with luminal G-protein coupled receptors in the gut, including GPR41 and GPR43, to release GLP-1, GLP-2, PYY and other gut hormones [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The fibers also modify the composition of the gut microbiota, favoring species such as <italic>bifidobacteria</italic> and <italic>lactobacilli</italic> that have been associated with metabolic health [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects have been observed in nonclinical studies and these may be related to direct effects on the microbiota and indirect effects on gut permeability and endotoxin absorption [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The weight loss potential of OFS and apple pectin has been studied in humans [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the case of OFS, modest weight loss has been associated with increased levels of PYY and decreased levels of ghrelin [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Many beneficial effects have been ascribed to anthocyanins and polyphenols which are present at high levels in blackcurrant extract. For example, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, one of the primary anthocyanins in blackcurrant extract, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in nonclinical species [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our unpublished data also show that blackcurrant extract strongly stimulates the endogenous release of GLP-1. In addition, it may alter gut bacterial types (with changes of colonic short chain fatty acids), activate AMPK, up-regulate GLUT-4 and down-regulate RBP4, TNF&#x003b1; and MCP-1, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153151.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Oleic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid (18:1n9) that is the principal fatty acid of olive oil. It stimulates gut peptide release through direct interaction with long-chain fatty-acid receptors, including GPR40 and GPR120 [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153151.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is also a direct PPAR alpha ligand and is converted to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, an endogenous ligand in the liver [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, conversion to oleoylethanolamide creates the opportunity for agonism of GPR119, CB1 &#x00026; PPAR alpha receptors [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is not surprising that oleic acid is believed to confer the metabolic benefits seen with a Mediterranean diet.</p><p>The unprecedented synergy we observed with the GSK457/ long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist combination in the DIO and <italic>db/db</italic> mouse models was sufficiently compelling to justify testing in humans. In subjects with T2D taking liraglutide, GSK457 did not reduce weight, but it reduced mean glucose by a small amount of doubtful clinical significance. In subjects with T2D taking metformin, there was a small increase in weight in the GSK457 group, and a small reduction in mean glucose and HbA1c. The lack of translation of the nonclinical efficacy to the human subjects with T2D was disappointing and caused us to examine possible causes in detail. Of the potential confounders that we considered, the most important is likely to have been the fact that GSK457 was mixed in the food provided to the mice (15% or 10% w/w in chow), so that food intake would have ensured ingestion of GSK457, whereas the clinical formulation was complicated to prepare and not easy to consume. As we were not able to source a GMP-grade process to manufacture GSK457 as a convenient bar or chew, we resorted to providing three of the components of GSK457 in individual childproof sachets and the oleic acid in capsules. This meant that a subject needed to consume an artificially-flavored 12 oz drink and 12 capsules twice a day when taking the top dose of 40 g that was tested in this study. We were not able to confirm adherence by measuring components of GSK457 in blood because they occur commonly in food components that are part of a normal Western diet. To mitigate the risk of non-adherence, drug accountability was performed at clinic visits, weekly for the first two weeks of treatment and every other week for the remaining treatment period. Phone contact reinforcement was performed in weeks where there was no clinic visit. In addition, we tested the acceptability of GSK457 in Part A with healthy subjects before embarking on Parts B and C with T2D subjects. Throughout the study we did not receive feedback that subjects could not consume the GSK457 drink and/or capsules, but 1 subject in Part A and 1 in Part B did not escalate up to 40 g and remained on 30 g for the duration of the treatment period because of gastrointestinal adverse events. Other factors may also have played a role in the lack of translation. The mice were provided with a chow of consistent composition, with GSK457 added uniformly, but the food choices of our subjects over the 6 weeks of treatment would have varied significantly, even within the constraints of a diabetic diet. The genetic variability of the humans would also have been much greater than that of the mice strains we used. It is also important to note that the mice were housed in close proximity and this would have ensured consistency of the microbial species in the gut, whereas T2D patients are known to have highly variable gut bacterial populations [<xref rid="pone.0153151.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and some of these species may have been less susceptible to the effects of the components of GSK457.</p><p>There is some precedent for nutritional components such as pectin affecting the absorption of orally administered drugs (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s016">S1 Materials and Methods</xref> for further information). In the clinical study GSK457 appeared to alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin and liraglutide. As outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s031">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s032">S11</xref> Tables, metformin AUC(0&#x02212;10 h) and Cmax decreased by 32% and 34%, respectively, in healthy subjects administered GSK457. As a result, in Part C the metformin dose was taken 1 h before taking GSK457 or placebo. Inspection of the concentration-time profiles indicated that this temporal separation reduced the interaction considerably. Overall, GSK457 did not affect liraglutide plasma exposures in the T2D patients. However, when the data from 1 outlier were excluded, there appeared to be an increase in liraglutide AUC(0&#x02212;t) and Cmax by 28% and 22%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s035">S14 Table</xref>). We do not have an explanation why oral GSK457 affected the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered liraglutide, and this may simply reflect random variation in a small study population.</p><p>Despite the disappointing clinical glucose and weight results, it is worth noting that administration of GSK457 was associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared to the placebo group, with an inconsistent effect on heart rate. While these were not predefined efficacy parameters, the results suggest that the combination of nutritional agents in GSK457 may have beneficial cardiovascular effects.</p><p>This project employed a number of novel approaches for the early drug development of an anti-obesity and anti-diabetic medication. First, the deliberate focus on nutritional agents with GRAS status was intended to maximize the safety profile of the eventual medicine. Secondly, we selected GSK457 following the systematic combinatorial assessment of 16 nutritional agents, and this mixture was found to synergize with a long-acting GLP-1 agonist in the animal models. Thirdly, at the time we were designing the first-in-human study for GSK457 there were no regulatory precedents for developing a combination of GRAS ingredients to treat obese patients with T2D. Advice obtained at a pre-IND meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration and the agency&#x02019;s <italic>Guidance for Industry</italic>: <italic>Botanical Drug Products (2004)</italic> were used to guide the initial approach for human investigation. As a result, the first-in-human study was 6 weeks long and was supported by a single species (rat) 6-week Good Laboratory Practice general toxicity study, based on available nonclinical and clinical safety information in the literature for the individual agents. The subjects remained at home for the most part, with close supervision to ensure safety, and intermittent visits to the clinical unit.</p><p>In addition, we employed a wireless technology that allowed real-time monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels and weights while the subjects were at home. Each glucometer and weighing scale was connected to a wireless modem hub in the subjects&#x02019; homes, which transmitted data to a database managed by AMC Health that were viewable in real-time by the investigators, the GlaxoSmithKline study physician and clinical scientist. This bypassed errors that might result from recording of glucose and weight values by a subject. Examples of the fasting blood glucose and weight readings that were obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s014">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s015">S14</xref> Figs, respectively. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s014">S13 Fig</xref>, Panels A-D show data for individual T2D patients to illustrate how the fasting glucose values at home can be generally concordant with the laboratory values measured in the clinical unit with less (Panel A) or more (Panel B) daily variability. Panel C and D are examples where there is significant discordance between home and clinical unit values created by marked daily variation of fasting glucose. Panel E shows the mean glucose data from Part C for T2D subjects taking metformin and GSK457 or placebo. It illustrates well how the home monitoring of glucose can aid the interpretation of clinical trial data. In this case, the clinical unit laboratory data suggested a reduction of fasting plasma glucose during the first 2 weeks of treatment with GSK457, but the home monitoring capillary glucose values clearly show that the glucose changes during the treatment period were likely to be an artifact. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153151.s015">S14 Fig</xref> is also revealing in that it shows examples of concordance (Panels A and B) and discordance (Panels C and D) between the weights measured at home and in the clinical unit. The frequent monitoring of weight allows the characterization of weight-change trajectories for each subject and identifies data points that are likely to be artifacts (black dots).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The combination of four GRAS ingredients in GSK457 co-administered with an exendin-4 AlbudAb produced remarkable reductions of weight and blood glucose in mouse models, but only minor effects were observed in human subjects with T2D who were administered GSK457 with liraglutide or metformin.
