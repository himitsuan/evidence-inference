<bold>Background:</bold> Pregnant women who are infected with HIV are at high risk of passing on the virus to their unborn baby during pregnancy, labour, and breastfeeding. Around 15%&#x02013;30% of babies born to HIV-positive women will themselves become infected, if the woman avoids breast-feeding but does not use any other means of preventing the virus from being passed on. However, if a drug, zidovudine (AZT), is given during pregnancy the chance of HIV being passed on to a baby drops from around 23% to around 8%. In some settings it may not be realistic to give the standard course of zidovudine, from 28 weeks of pregnancy, because of its cost and complexity. A number of trials have therefore looked at whether standard-course and short-course zidovudine are equivalent at reducing the risk of passing on HIV from mother to baby. One trial, the Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial-1 (PHPT-1) found that the short treatment course was substantially less effective at preventing HIV from being passed on from mother to baby. Current international guidance therefore recommends starting zidovudine at 28 weeks of pregnancy. However, zidovudine does have several side effects, including anemia; it can also cause a drop in the levels of certain types of white blood cell, and is thought to be toxic to bone marrow. The researchers who had carried out the PHPT-1 trial therefore wanted to do a subsequent analysis of data from that trial to find out whether there were any differences in these safety outcomes between standard and short course zidovudine.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> In total 1,436 women were recruited into the trial and assigned to receive either zidovudine from 28 weeks of pregnancy until delivery (standard course; 769 women), or from 35 weeks to delivery (short course; 667). Blood tests were performed at 26, 32, and 35 weeks of pregnancy and then at delivery, and the main outcomes assessed in this secondary analysis were the hemoglobin levels (to check for anemia), and levels of white blood cells, including the levels of two particular types (neutrophils and lymphocytes). The researchers found that standard-course zidovudine resulted in a drop at 35 weeks in the levels of hemoglobin and white blood cells, relative to short-course zidovudine. However, by the time of delivery these levels had recovered and no significant differences could be observed between the two arms of the trial. Women receiving standard-course zidovudine were more likely to experience severe anemia, which although a rare event in both arms of the trial, could have serious outcomes.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The original trial from which these data were collected was a relatively large, randomized study and in which there was a low rate of loss to follow up. Although no formal sample size calculation was performed for the analyses presented here, the study probably had sufficient power to detect small differences in the outcomes assessed. A key limitation of this study is that the analyses presented here are a secondary exploration of data from the PHPT-1 trial and should therefore be seen as hypotheses to test in further studies, rather than as definitive conclusions.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> The analyses presented here add to the findings of the parent trial, PHPT-1, by providing additional data about the toxicity of zidovudine. Other trials have not clearly established whether there are differences between short- and standard-course zidovudine in terms of their toxicity. The findings support current guidelines recommending standard-course zidovudine therapy for HIV-positive pregnant women. It is also crucial that efforts are made to ensure women worldwide can get access to facilities for monitoring the status of their HIV infection, and then receive highly active antiretroviral therapy when it is needed.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Briand N, Lallemant M, Jourdain G, Techapalokul S, Tunthanathip P, et al.

Since the release of this result, prophylactic use of zidovudine has been recommended in all industrialized countries [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To reduce the costs and increase the feasibility of this intervention in developing countries, short-course zidovudine, starting at 36 wk of pregnancy, was evaluated [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, longer treatment durations proved more efficacious [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and since 2004, the World Health Organization has recommended zidovudine initiation at 28 wk of gestation or as soon as possible thereafter, in women who do not need treatment for their own health or when antiretroviral combinations are not available [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Perinatal zidovudine exposure is associated with transient anaemia and neutropenia [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and bone marrow toxicity of zidovudine, probably related to mitochondrial defects, remains a concern [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

All were exposed to zidovudine from 28 wk gestation (8/754 versus 0/656, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Among these women, two were transfused because of a haemorrhage (at delivery and at 7 d before delivery). One woman with a thalassemia trait received packed red cell transfusions at 45 and 37 d before delivery. The remaining five women were transfused at 0, 2, 4, 25 and 64 d before delivery because of anaemia, including one woman with a haemoglobin level of 4.6 g/dl who delivered a stillborn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretation</title><p>This study showed that women initiating zidovudine at 28 wk gestation had a transient decrease of haemoglobin level, leucocytes count, and absolute neutrophil count compared to women initiating zidovudine at 35 wk. However, by the time of delivery this initial decrease reversed in women randomized to the long regimen as compared to women randomized in the short regimen, except for haemoglobin levels, which remained lower by 0.2 (0.1 to 0.3) g/dl in women with longer exposure to zidovudine. No negative effect of zidovudine exposure could be detected on the lymphocyte count evolution from 26 wk of gestation to delivery.</p><p>This analysis confirms that the severity of haematological toxicity of zidovudine is associated with the duration of exposure. Indeed, at delivery, the percentages of grade 4 anaemia were higher in women randomized to the long regimen as compared with those randomized to the short regimen (0.9% versus 0.0%, respectively). Although adverse events such as severe anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia were uncommon, they should not be taken lightly because of their life-threatening potential. Yet the rate of women who were transfused was of the same magnitude as has been seen in other studies of HIV-uninfected women not receiving zidovudine [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. No woman stopped the study treatment because of haematological toxicity, although one woman exposed to zidovudine from 28 wk of gestation developed severe anaemia and delivered a stillborn. This woman presented at pre-entry biological parameters known to be associated with anaemia, such as low CD4 count (80 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) and high HIV RNA viral load (5.33 log copies/ml) [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Women in the study were provided with iron supplementation, according to the national recommendation [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, we had no information about adherence to this recommendation. As the duration of zidovudine exposure was assigned randomly, supplementation is likely to be balanced among the randomized groups in each site and should not have been a source of bias.</p><p>More than 90% of the laboratory results for haemoglobin level, leucocyte count, and neutrophil count were available at each visit, with no difference between the randomization arms. Using the complete data method, the sample size remained large enough to demonstrate small statistical differences, even if the clinical significance appears small. For the lymphocyte counts, however, only 33% of the laboratory results were available at 32 and 35 wk of gestation and at delivery. It is possible that the absence of significant difference in lymphocyte evolution between the two groups could be explained by a lack of power.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The observed evolution pattern of haematological parameters in women randomized to the short regimen was similar to the physiologic evolution generally described in pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast, in women randomized to the long regimen, the evolution of the haemoglobin, leucocytes, and neutrophils was significantly slowed down until 35 wk, followed by a clear catch-up phenomenon during the last weeks of pregnancy. It should be noted that, in the absence of a control group of women receiving no zidovudine during pregnancy, it is impossible to evaluate the actual impact of zidovudine from 35 wk of gestation until delivery. It is likely that, in the absence of zidovudine exposure, the values of haematological parameters at delivery would have been higher, and this may explain, in part, the apparent convergence of the two groups at delivery.</p><p>Interestingly, the 37.4% prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c;11 g/dl) at delivery, observed in our study was similar to recent national estimates of 38.6% in Thailand [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results on the potential toxicity of zidovudine during pregnancy cannot be directly compared with other studies because of the different durations of zidovudine exposure, haematological parameters considered, and overall study designs. In a placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of a short course zidovudine regimen from 36 wk gestation in Thailand, pregnant women exposed to zidovudine had a significantly lower mean haematocrit than unexposed women, 31.9% versus 33.0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03 [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our study, the mean haematocrit level at delivery was higher&#x02014;34.8% in women exposed to zidovudine from 35 wk (unpublished data). The absence of difference in the mean haemoglobin level at delivery in two other placebo-controlled trials may be explained by their relatively limited sample size [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>From 26 wk of gestation to delivery, CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, HIV RNA viral load higher than 50,000 copies/ml, and an advanced HIV clinical stage were independently associated with a negative evolution of the haematological parameters. Similar findings have already been reported [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], emphasising the need for systematic CD4 testing during pregnancy and access to highly active antiretroviral therapy for immunocompromised women [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that HIV, per se, may be associated with the development of anaemia, presumably because of direct effects of the virus on bone marrow suppression and reduction of erythropoietin production and response [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>The benefit of early zidovudine initiation, namely, its greater efficacy in reducing perinatal transmission [<xref rid="pctr-0020011-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], is not outweighed by significant disadvantages for the mother in terms of toxicity. As more and more women receive antiretroviral therapies during pregnancy, monitoring of the haematological effects of these therapies remains paramount to ensure their safety.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020011-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(27 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020011.sd001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020011-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><caption><p>(336 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020011.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020011-sd003"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>Statistical Analysis Plan</title><p>(22 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020011.sd003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the investigators who collaborated in the trial, Dr. Ren&#x000e9; Ecochard for his advice on the statistical analysis, Intira Collins for her editing of the manuscript, and Kanchana Than-in-at for administrative help.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="n103" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
