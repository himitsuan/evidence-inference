Preemptive analgesia has been defined as treatment that: (1) starts before surgery; (2) prevents the establishment of central sensitization caused by incisional injury (covers only the period of surgery) and (3) prevents the establishment of central sensitization caused by incisional and inflammatory injuries (covers the period of surgery and the initial post-operative period).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Prospective study design is a valid method for this kind of research work, so we have designed this study accordingly. There might be chances of biased results from patients as well as from investigator's side if they are aware of time period of consumption of diclofenac sodium but, in this study we have minimized all such bias by making patient, surgeon and investigator blinded and also with and with use of randomization of the patient was done to minimize bias using a software.</p><p>Diclofenac sodium is used as preemptive analgesic agent because of its easy ability, economic effective pain control and and relatively safe drug with minimal reported allergy. The plasma half-life of diclofenac sodium is also 1&#x02013;2 hours, so we can achieve ideal optimal concentration if we provide it in 1-hour preoperatively.</p><p>visual analogue scale (VAS) scale is an accepted method for assessment of post-operative pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Comfort level of the patients are also superior in experimental group than control group as shown with help of derived VAS score.</p><p>The mean scores of tenderness in our study at 1-hour post-operatively in the experimental group and control group are 1.86 and 2.16, respectively, with <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.099 which is less significant; however, the mean scores for 3 days post-operatively for the experimental group and control group are 3.5 and 5.1, respectively, with <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.001 which is highly significant. Score mean of tenderness on the 6<sup>th</sup> post-operative day for experimental group is 1.6 and for control group is 3.6 with <italic>P</italic> value of 0.001 which shows a highly significant difference. And for trismus mean score at 1-hour post-operatively for experimental group is 0.36 and control group 0.66 with <italic>P</italic> value of 0.02, which shows a significant difference. All other findings show no significance difference.</p><p>These achieved results are correlative to the previous studies. Ong, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] in 2004 conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study where 34 patients had each of their identical-impacted mandibular third molars removed under local anesthesia on two occasions. Throughout the 12-h investigation period, patients reported significantly lower pain intensity scores in the ketorolac pre-treated sides when compared with the post-treated sides. Aoki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] in 2006 compared the efficacy of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor meloxicam for treatment of postoperative oral surgical pain by assessing in a randomized-controlled trial. Patients undergoing unilateral mandibular 3<sup>rd</sup> molar extraction surgery were allocated to 3 groups, A, B and C. After oral premedication of meloxicam 10 mg in group A, ampiroxicam 27 mg in group B and placebo in group C., post-operative pain was evaluated at the clinic on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> postoperative day (POD) using a VAS and concluded that COX-2 inhibitor, meloxicam 10 mg, used for premedication reduced post-operative pain compared with control in oral surgery. Pozos-Guillen, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] in 2007 compared the efficacy of tramadol given before or immediately after surgical extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar under local anesthesia. In this prospective, randomized-controlled, double-blind pilot study, 3 groups of 20 patients each were included: tramadol preoperative, 100 mg intramuscularly (IM) 1 hour before surgery (group A); tramadol postoperative, 100 mg IM immediately after surgery (group B); and saline (group C). This study suggests the preemptive use of tramadol as an alternative for the acute pain treatment after the removal of an impacted mandibular third molar that is carried out under local anesthesia.</p><p>Whereas some of the studies show contradictory results from our study. Sisk, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] in 1990 conducted a clinical trial for comparison of preoperative and postoperative naproxen sodium for suppression of pain in dental surgery cases. In their trial, they had given naproxen sodium 550 mg 30 min postop in control group while in preemptive group naproxen sodium 550 mg 30 min preop was given. Results are not supportive of the use of preemptive analgesia. Kaczmarzyk, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] in 2010 conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial preemptive effect of ketoprofen on postoperative pain following third molar surgery. Ninety six patients were placed into three groups: pre-group (ketoprofen 60 min preoperatively); post-group (ketoprofen 60 min postoperatively); and no-group (placebo) and resulted that initial onset of pain was significantly delayed only in the post-group. Ketoprofen administered after third molar surgery provides more effective pain control than ketoprofen administered before the surgery or placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
