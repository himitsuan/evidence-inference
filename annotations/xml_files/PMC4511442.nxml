Automatic ventilator control and ventilation modes designed for weaning from mechanical ventilation can be particularly helpful, as 40 % of mechanical ventilation time is spent on this procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Owing to the complexity of the decision-making process for weaning, the use of computers has been increasingly favored to ensure that protocols are followed completely and safely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Automated weaning programs were developed to bring better control to this process and to make it faster and more secure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients&#x02019; information is entered into the program for monitoring, then, through the program&#x02019;s decision-making process defined by the weaning protocol, the computer suggests changes or maintenance of ventilator parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This happens through the direct inclusion of monitored data into the program by the ICU team, whereby the computer defines the action to be taken and the caregivers act accordingly, with the program dictating the protocol. This process can also occur automatically, through the so-called closed-loop ventilation system, when this software is integrated with a mechanical ventilator. The ventilator monitors the patient and, through an internal algorithm, changes ventilation parameters according to the ventilation program in a constant feedback ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In general, ventilation modes in closed loop target the lowest possible ventilatory support needed to properly ventilate the patient, which is why the most popular forms of closed-loop ventilation are those used for weaning from mechanical ventilation. Automated systems use closed-loop control to enable ventilators to perform basic and advanced functions while supporting respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>A recent meta-analysis showed that weaning with SmartCare&#x02122; (Dr&#x000e4;ger, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany) significantly decreases weaning time in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. SmartCare&#x02122; is a unique automated weaning system that measures selected respiratory variables, adapts ventilator output to individual patient needs by operationalizing predetermined algorithms and automatically conducting spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) when predetermined thresholds are met.</p><p>ICU weaning protocols driven by respiratory therapists and/or physiotherapists can also be effective in shortening weaning duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the adult ICU of Albert Einstein Hospital, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil, there is a weaning protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that consists of a daily assessment for the possibility of an SBT. The ICU SBT is performed in pressure support ventilation (PSV), which allows for better patient monitoring, a greater control of inspired oxygen fraction (F<sc>i</sc>O<sub>2</sub>) and the maintenance of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The SBT is performed as soon as the daily assessment indicates that a weaning trial is feasible. If the SBT is successful, the patient is extubated. Otherwise, patients return to the previous ventilation mode and another daily assessment of readiness for weaning is performed the next day (24-hour interval). If it succeeds, another SBT is attempted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that the weaning strategy with SmartCare&#x02122; ventilatory mode would be as effective as our respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven weaning protocol in the ICU patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare SmartCare&#x02122; ventilatory mode with our validated respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven weaning protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours.

All the patients were subjected to an SBT, which consists of an integrated assessment of the patients while they breathe spontaneously through PSV of 5&#x02013;7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and PEEP of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.

After the patients who failed an SBT were returned to the PSV ventilatory mode, they were then reevaluated to identify the causes of the failure. After 24 hours, the patients were reevaluated again, and, if they passed the daily assessment for eligibility to wean, a new SBT was performed. The duration of weaning (from randomization to extubation), the rate of extubation failure (need to return to invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 hours after extubation) and mechanical ventilation time (from intubation to extubation) were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Automatic weaning group (SmartCare&#x02122; group)</title><p>The patients were ventilated on CPAP/PSV mode (EVITA XL) using PSV mode.

The apnea parameters were then set for apnea ventilation: f of 15 breaths per minute, VT of 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and flow trigger sensitivity of 2 L/min. After these adjustments, the SmartCare&#x02122; mode was then initiated. The ventilator automatically adjusted pressure support at the minimum level while keeping the patient within a comfort zone. If the patient&#x02019;s condition developed satisfactorily, the ventilator attempted an SBT and sounded an alarm when the patient was ready for extubation.

There were six clinical complications in the SmartCare&#x02122; group. One involved a positive cuff leak test that indicated upper-airway edema which needed to be treated with corticosteroids. One patient had temporary hemodynamic instability that had to be treated before extubation. One patient had gastrointestinal bleeding. One patient had nausea impairing the extubation. One was a case of difficult airway that the attending physician determined required extubation by bronchoscopy. One was a patient who needed insertion of a femoral catheter (for dialytic procedure) just after the weaning process was started.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Reintubation rate, ventilator malfunction and clinical complications in the two weaning protocols</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3"/><th colspan="4">Weaning mode</th><th rowspan="3">

A recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] involving 496 participants (7 trials of time from randomization to extubation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed that weaning time using SmartCare&#x02122; was decreased compared with non-automated weaning (MD &#x02212;2.68 days; 95 % confidence interval [CI] &#x02212;3.99 to &#x02212;1.37; <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;0.0001) in the presence of substantial heterogeneity (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> =68 %; <italic>p</italic> =0.005). One possible explanation for the unexpected result of this trial that showed an increased weaning time in the SmartCare&#x02122; group is that weaning time in the meta-analysis was defined as the time from randomization to extubation (as determined by the authors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Weaning time as defined by authors can vary among studies as follows: (1) from the initiation of spontaneous breathing (CPAP), (2) from the initiation of an assisted mode of ventilation (e.g., pressure support, volume-assisted, Proportional Assist Ventilation Plus [PAV+; Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA], adaptive support ventilation, Automatic tube compensation), or (3) as the patient is ready to undergo an SBT. In this study, we analyzed critically ill patients ventilated for more than 24 hours who successfully passed through a daily assessment of weaning evaluation, after which the SBT and extubation were quicker in the respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven protocol. This finding may be attributable to more efficient management of the intercurrences and individual variability, as there were human brains behind the decisions. Another explanation for the prolonged weaning with SmartCare&#x02122; is that more clinical complications not related to the ventilatory mode itself occurred in this group, which may have delayed the patients&#x02019; extubation procedures.</p><p>If the start of a weaning trial is considered to be when the patient commences assisted ventilation, the weaning time would be increased compared with a patient who successfully passed a complete daily assessment for weaning evaluation. In terms of weaning duration, it took, on average, 60 and 110 minutes for the respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven weaning and SmartCare&#x02122; mode, respectively. Although this difference was significant, both values are within the ideal interval established in the literature for the performance of SBTs (30&#x02013;120 [18-20] minutes). In a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the pooled results of 7 studies (496 patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed that weaning time for SmartCare&#x02122; weaning groups was 4.57 (3.77) days vs. 7.56 (10.52) in non-automated groups. This much greater weaning time derived from the meta-analysis vs. minutes observed in the present study should represent a less sick ICU population or that our complete daily assessment for weaning is more complete and better selected the readiness for weaning and extubation. The low reintubation rate for this study (i.e., two cases in each arm [5.7 %]) reinforces the hypothesis that our patients recovered well from the respiratory failure and were in fact able to be extubated from the ventilator after the SBTs.</p><p>The results of this study show that total invasive mechanical ventilation times were similar for both weaning modes; average mechanical ventilation duration was approximately 4 days in both weaning modes, a shorter time than previously reported values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis, authors reported pooled data of 7 trials involving 520 participants and showed a significant reduction in total duration of mechanical ventilation of 1.8 days favoring SmartCare&#x02122; (MD: &#x02212;1.68 days; 95 % CI: &#x02212;3.33 to &#x02212;0.03; <italic>p</italic> =0.05) with substantial heterogeneity (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> =53 %; <italic>p</italic> =0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The mean mechanical ventilation time (pooled data from 7 studies, 520 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) was 8.34 (5.88) days for SmartCare&#x02122; versus 10.48 (8.25) days for non-automated weaning, showing that the condition of the patients in these seven polled studies was more severe than that of the patients in the present study.</p><p>We believe that the efficacy of this respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven weaning protocol derives from the structure and composition of the ICU professionals in our institution. The adult ICU of Albert Einstein Hospital has physiotherapists (physiotherapists in Brazil also act as respiratory therapists) 24 hours per day, with one physiotherapist for every six to eight patients. These therapists are highly trained in weaning protocols of mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The physiotherapist is able to watch patients closely, quickly identifying patients who are prepared for SBT through a daily assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in accordance with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement recommendations for the quality of care in ICUs. There are daily multidisciplinary rounds with clear goals for the assessment of the patients. Once all the patients&#x02019; goals have been met, there is a team discussion about each patient&#x02019;s progress, which also speeds up the process of weaning. Therefore, it is possible that automatic modes could be faster in a service with fewer physiotherapists.</p><p>It is worth noting the occurrence of no malfunction events related to the ventilator in the respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven weaning group, as well as three in the automatic mode, two of which were related to a malfunction of the capnography that prevented PSV from being decreased. After further inspection, these problems were found to be related to the EtCO<sub>2</sub> cable that connects the ventilator to the cuvette where EtCO<sub>2</sub> rate is measured. Following cable replacement, this problem was solved. Although previous studies with SmartCare&#x02122; have not reported this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the observation of this problem in two of six units used indicates that manufacturers should ensure that EtCO<sub>2</sub> cables are properly adapted. There was also one case where psychomotor agitation and tachypnea led to an unnecessary increase in PSV in the automatic weaning mode. A similar problem was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] where a child was not weaned in automatic mode, owing to pain and tachypnea. Although the influence of respiratory rate for PSV adjustment was less frequent with SmartCare&#x02122; mode than with previously studied automatic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], these findings indicate that automatic weaning may not be ideal for patients with tachypnea as a result of pain, fever or delirium, even when more parameters in addition to respiratory rate are monitored.</p><p>We acknowledge that there are some limitations of this study. First, the study included only 70 patients (35 in each mode)&#x02014;a small sample size, but sufficient for the detection of significant differences in weaning duration. Second, the study was conducted among adults; hence, it is not possible to generalize our findings with regard to other age groups. Further research should prove fruitful in this respect. Finally, we tested the SmartCare&#x02122; system after the patients successfully passed a complete daily assessment for weaning readiness, and this fact might have decreased the effectiveness of SmartCare&#x02122; performance during the weaning phase of invasive mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A respiratory physiotherapy&#x02013;driven weaning protocol can decrease weaning time compared with an automatic system, as it takes into account individual weaning difficulties.
