Despite the evident advancement in the domain, these goals are still unachievable. The occurrence of postoperative chronic pain is especially disturbing as it is felt by 0-43% of patients, 11% on average [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Postoperative pain is the consequence of tissue dissection and postoperative local inflammation. As a result, the surrounding nerves become damaged and nociceptive stimulation occurs. Surgeon's experience, local complications, synthetic material implantation are considered to be dominant causative factors. Inflammation appears with the ligation of the hernia sack, neurectomy, when a nerve gets captured into a suture or scar around the implant and with ischemic testicle. Sutures applied behind the periosteum of the pubic tubercle lead to chronic periostitis, another source of the chronic pain. Surgical access and the way implant is fixed are irrelevant [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Matyja <italic>et al</italic>. showed that tension-free technique does not influence the incidence of the postoperative pain [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Also the comparison of Lichtenstein and Desard technique did not reveal any significant differences in the early postoperative painful sensation [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The traditional method of penetrating mesh fixation in the groin has its flaws. Except for bleeding after femoral or epigastric vessels damage caused by a needle, sutures may cause tissue ischemia, muscle contracture and nerve damage. The change may be the source of postoperative and chronic pain. Remission of the chronic ailments after sutures are removed in the evidence of cause and effect reliance [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Attempts have been made to replace non-absorbable with absorbable sutures, but clinical trials did not show any significant differences [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, staples or tackers caused new dangers, but did not relieve pain [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are numerous articles on the prevention and pain occurrence after inguinal hernia repair in the literature. Reports concerning chronic pain after hernia repair are especially disturbing. Pain is diversely defined. In the following report, the British Pain Society definition was accepted: chronic pain is continuous pain, lasting over 12 weeks or &#x02013; in case of surgical procedures or damages &#x02013; it is pain occurring after tissues have healed. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), chronic pain is recognized when it occurs after the surgery and lasts minimum 2 months. This definition is criticized as it does not take into account changes occurring later on when the pain starts to decrease gradually e.g. due to the termination of inflammation. Such sequence of events may be expected in hernioplasty: after tissue structures have been strengthened by synthetic material. Those issues are recapped in the newest reports [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Apposition of tissues without excessive tension is a relatively new factor mentioned, which corresponds to the experience of the surgical team. Too energetic surgical maneuvers (the strength applied here amounts up to 20 N) causes micro damages of the surrounding tissue which activates painful sensations occurring regardless of other prophylactic treatment. Two groups of patients should be acknowledged in pain assessment: young people, professionally and physically active and middle-aged or older patients with limited physical activity. The risk of chronic pain occurrence in the 2<sup>nd</sup> group is significantly lower [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, the methods of implant fixation have been discussed during meetings. Penetrating (staplers/tackers) and adhesive (sealants) methods of fixation are compared and situations when an implant does not have to be fixed to the surrounding tissues are defined. The first indexed report dates back to 1984. Russian doctors, Shapkina <italic>et al</italic>. used cyanoacrylic sealant in surgery in children. One hundred and eight hernioplasties were performed with good results [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The next trials were performed a decade later by Farouk <italic>et al</italic>. who modified Lichtenstein method by fixing the mesh with cyanoacrylic adhesive in grown-up patients. No recurrences were observed in the 1<sup>st</sup> year after the surgery [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The results achieved using a fibrin sealant, created by mixing fibrinogen component with a thrombin solution, were presented for the first time by Canonico <italic>et al</italic>. The method was employed in patients with coagulation disturbances (1999), and next in healthy patients and professional athletes [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To determine a valid conclusion different methods of mesh fixation have to pass through all the phases of clinical trials. Having considered the importance of the issue and its practical implications on the one hand, and lack of reliable clinical information with regard to the usage of cyanoacrylic sealant (3 indexed randomised control trials &#x02013; RCTs), on the other hand, we started our own, maintaining the highest possible methodological standard prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial (both a physician and patient).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Fourty-one male patients with primary inguinal hernia, operated on using Lichtenstein technique from July 2008 to November 2010 were included in the trial in the Department of General and Endocrine Surgery, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz.

</p><p>Randomization was prepared with the use of software available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">http://www.randomization.com/</ext-link> (1<sup>st</sup> generator was employed). Information concerning mesh fixation was available in sealed envelopes in the operating room. During mesh fixation stage, randomly chosen envelope was opened and the information was discreetly passed to the surgeon so that the conscious patient would not be aware of the surgeon's proceedings. Data concerning mesh fixation ware gathered in a separate database, but were excluded from the surgical protocol, patient's history and release form. The way nerves were handled in the surgical field was described in each case (ilioinguinal nerve, hypogastric nerve and genital branch of genitofemoral nerve were always identified). Whether the nerve was left intact or excised was recorded in the database. Prolene (Ethicon) polypropylene mesh sized 15 cm &#x000d7; 7-10 cm was employed (its transverse size adapted to patient's anatomy). Glubran sealant (<italic>N</italic>-butyl -2-cyanoacrylate; GEM S.r.l., Viareggio, Italy) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Points of sealing approximated typical areas where sutures were placed, 1 mm was used each time. In the &#x0201c;suture&#x0201d; series, the mesh was fixed to the inguinal ligament with the continuous 2-0 polypropylene suture, and to the aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle with single 2-0 PDS sutures. Closing off the inguinal canal, sutures for the subcutaneous tissue and suturing the skin were identical in both groups. The procedures were performed by 4 surgeons (26, 10, 4 and 1 procedure). The method of anesthesia was not standardized. The patient decided in agreement with the anesthesiologist on the basis of the clinical situation. The procedures were performed under general, subarachnoid or local anesthesia (50: 50 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.25% bupivacaine). In the postoperative period, ketoprofen was administered and in case of contraindications &#x02013; tramadol. Doses of analgesics used were recorded. Patients were evaluated during follow-up appointments by a surgeon who did not know the method used and had no access to documentation. Patients had scheduled checkups, but in practice, with time they became less self-disciplined and the appointments got postponed. The initial tests took place 1 day before the procedure (they were marked as &#x02013;1), the first checkup on the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day. The actual median values for the subsequent follow-up appointments were: 10<sup>th</sup>, 32<sup>th</sup>, 78<sup>th</sup>, 202<sup>nd</sup> and 401<sup>st</sup> postoperative day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table I</xref>).

In the early postoperative period in patients with sealant used, painful ailments were relatively less intense (VAS scale, 2<sup>nd</sup> day); patients operated on in such way came back earlier to everyday activities. The differences appeared also on the 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, but they were statistically insignificant. Although, it is believed that uncomplicated inguinal hernia do not cause painful ailments, it is not supported by studies. In our own observations, patients felt pain of an average VAS value of 28 &#x000b1;19 mm, which corresponds to mild pain. These values are higher than quoted by Page <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; in their trial fewer patients with moderate and severe preoperative pain were included.

EHS congress in 2011 confirmed increasing interest in non-penetrating mesh fixation. The results of such procedures in inguinal and abdominal hernia repair were discussed.

They were synthesized in 1942 by Harry Coover in Kodak laboratories when he was searching for a super clean yielding material for rifle datives. After a few unsuccessful applications, Kodak created &#x0201c;Eastman #910&#x0201d; glue out of the product. In 1964, as a result of Kodak and Ethicon's studies, it was submitted to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an agent for closing wounds. Since 1966 the sealant was used in the Vietnam War. Used at the battle ground in the form of spray, it stopped bleeding very successfully. According to veterans of this war, it saved many lives. Otherwise, soldiers would have bled to death. It is ironic, but FDA forbade the use of the adhesive. It did not prevent its use during the war, though [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. FDA did not approve of the sealant because of skin irritation it caused and its reaction with water which released cyanoacetate and formaldehyde. Only 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate met the expectations; it caused less skin irritations and it bound the tissues better than previously synthesized compounds. In 1998, FDA approved this compound for wound closing, and in 2001 &#x02013; as antibacterial barrier. The product was introduced to the market as Dermabond. There are many cyanoacrylic adhesives available for different uses. The majority of them are non-absorbable, characterized by cytotoxicity and polymerization at high temperature. Some cyanoacrylic adhesives are used in the medical industry: <italic>N</italic>-butyl-1,2- cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl, B. Braun), 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate (Dermabond, Ethicon), <italic>N</italic>-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Indermil, Covidien) and <italic>N</italic>-hexyl-cyanoacrylate (Glubran 2, Ifabond, Fimed, France). Glubran 2 sealant used in the trial is characterized by fast polymerization, and the accompanying chemical reaction does not cause the temperature rise above 45&#x000b0;C. Its low viscosity facilitates application through a catheter. It is gradually absorbed, without an excessive foreign-body reaction. It is very effective; 1 ml is enough for bilateral hernia. Experimental investigations provide contradictory information about Glubran adhesive safety. Fortelny <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that tissue integration with a mesh was impaired in the area where the sealant was used. The adhesive induced local, excessive inflammation and its remains stiffened tissues &#x02013; the abdominal wall of a rat [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Losi <italic>et al</italic>. on the same experimental model observed mild inflammation with a small number of macrophage and well supplied with blood connective tissue around the adhesive and mesh filaments. Sealant remains were visible in the whole 5-month observation period [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The newest, still awaiting publication, results of Kukleta's research showed that after a year Optline LP mesh fixed in the rabbit's abdominal wall with histoacryl was faster integrated than one fixed with MonoPlus 3-0 sutures. After a year, the adhesive was absorbed completely and its local tolerance was assessed as good [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The clinical literature concerning cyanoacrylic adhesive in open hernia surgeries in grownups is rather scarce. There are 7 indexed publications altogether, and two of them pertain to laparoscopy [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The first prospective, randomized report comparing cyanoacrylic sealant with sutures was presented by Helbling <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. No evident differences in pain sensation were observed after 3 months with a slight tendency towards decrease in ailments in the adhesive group. Testini using Rytkow technique in 156 patients observed that chronic pain occurred only in 3.4% of the operated on with sutures; in the series with sealant (fibrin or cyanoacrylic) it did not occur at all [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In a Nowobilski <italic>et al</italic>. trial no fundamental differences were observed in the postoperative course within 4.7 months in patients operated on using Lichtenstein technique with sealant (Indermin, Loctite) and sutures [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The value of the report is decreased by the fact that authors do not write about randomization or control in patients. In a short report concerning the same series of patients (however with different numerical amount) there is information about 1 recurrent hernia in a sealant group [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A report by Paajanen <italic>et al</italic>. may be used to benchmark our own results, as they randomized Glubran (<italic>n</italic> = 151) and Dexon 3-0 (<italic>n</italic> = 151) fixation in a multicenter study. Procedures were performed on an outpatient basis, Optilene mesh was implanted, oblique hernia sac was dissected. During 1 year observation, hernia recurred twice in each group (1.4%). Chronic pain (VAS &#x02265; 2, over 3 months) in patients from both groups occurred with the similar frequency (sealant vs. sutures, 20% vs. 15% respectively). It was demonstrated that chronic pain depended on preoperative pain occurrence, patient's age and the length of the procedure; the method of mesh fixation was irrelevant [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The results of clinical assessment did not reveal fundamental differences between a sealant and sutures. With a corresponding definition of the chronic pain patient, our own results do not diverge from the quoted observations (22% of patients with chronic pain). Penetrating and adhesive fixation was compared more often in laparoscopic TAPP than in open surgeries. Three RCT and 5 controlled clinical trials were published. It was observed that adhesive fixation reduces recurrence (0.4% vs. 0.6%) and painful sensations (in 4 out 5 trials).</p><p>For example, Olmi <italic>et al</italic>. compared different techniques of fixation in a large series of patients. They showed the superiority of fibrin sealant over penetrating fixation [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Kukleta's clinical experience is also convincing. He performed 1337 transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) procedures using only Glubran 2 adhesive fixation [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Results of previous trials (however, mostly concerning TAPP) reveal that sealant fixation reduces the risk of chronic pain in comparison to staplers/tackers (grade of recommendation 1B). It is not without significance that biological and synthetic sealants are less expensive than devices for penetrating fixation. Our own research, carried out in a series of patients operated on through an anterior approach, did not reveal fundamental differences between adhesive and penetrating fixation. With the similar results of 16-month observation, it was demonstrated that adhesive mesh fixation may have positive influence on the early postoperative period.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
