It can be treated by arthroscopic hip surgery, including reshaping the hip, or with physiotherapist-led conservative care. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy with best conservative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>UK FASHIoN is a pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, done at 23 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. We enrolled patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome who presented at these hospitals. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old, had hip pain with radiographic features of cam or pincer morphology but no osteoarthritis, and were believed to be likely to benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible; only the most symptomatic hip was randomly assigned to treatment and followed-up. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy (an individualised, supervised, and progressive physiotherapist-led programme of conservative care). Randomisation was stratified by impingement type and recruiting centre and was done by research staff at each hospital, using a central telephone randomisation service. Patients and treating clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but researchers who collected the outcome assessments and analysed the results were masked. The primary outcome was hip-related quality of life, as measured by the patient-reported International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) 12 months after randomisation, and analysed in all eligible participants who were allocated to treatment (the intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN64081839, and is closed to recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between July 20, 2012, and July 15, 2016, we identified 648 eligible patients and recruited 348 participants: 171 participants were allocated to receive hip arthroscopy and 177 to receive personalised hip therapy. Three further patients were excluded from the trial after randomisation because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Follow-up at the primary outcome assessment was 92% (319 of 348 participants). At 12 months after randomisation, mean iHOT-33 scores had improved from 39&#x000b7;2 (SD 20&#x000b7;9) to 58&#x000b7;8 (27&#x000b7;2) for participants in the hip arthroscopy group, and from 35&#x000b7;6 (18&#x000b7;2) to 49&#x000b7;7 (25&#x000b7;5) in the personalised hip therapy group. In the primary analysis, the mean difference in iHOT-33 scores, adjusted for impingement type, sex, baseline iHOT-33 score, and centre, was 6&#x000b7;8 (95% CI 1&#x000b7;7&#x02013;12&#x000b7;0) in favour of hip arthroscopy (p=0&#x000b7;0093). This estimate of treatment effect exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (6&#x000b7;1 points). There were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [72%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy group) versus 102 events (in 88 [60%] of 146 patients) in the personalised hip therapy group, with muscle soreness being the most common of these (58 [42%] <italic>vs</italic> 69 [47%]). There were seven serious adverse events reported by participating hospitals. Five (83%) of six serious adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were related to treatment, and the one in the personalised hip therapy group was not. There were no treatment-related deaths, but one patient in the hip arthroscopy group developed a hip joint infection after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Hip arthroscopy and personalised hip therapy both improved hip-related quality of life for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Hip arthroscopy led to a greater improvement than did personalised hip therapy, and this difference was clinically significant. Further follow-up will reveal whether the clinical benefits of hip arthroscopy are maintained and whether it is cost effective in the long term.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute of Health Research.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a painful disorder of the hip that is caused by a premature contact (impingement) between the femur and acetabulum during hip movements.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This premature contact typically occurs as a result of certain hip shapes, such as cam or pincer morphology.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Cam morphology refers to a flattening or convexity at the femoral head neck junction, whereas pincer morphology refers to a focal or global over-coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome leads to progressive damage within the joint, including the acetabular labrum and articular cartilage,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and is associated with the development of osteoarthritis of the hip.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p id="para20"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para30"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para40">Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is a relatively common non-arthritic cause of hip pain in young adults. It is caused by symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and acetabular rim during hip motion, and this phenomenon is associated with certain hip shapes. Repeated impingement leads to damage to the articular cartilage or to acetabular labral tears, and it is these injuries that are thought to be painful. In the past decade, surgeons have developed arthroscopic (ie, keyhole) surgical techniques to treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. The rationale is that reshaping the hip and repairing cartilage and labral damage will prevent impingement and relieve symptoms. In 2013, we did a Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. We searched MEDLINE (from 1946 to Nov 19, 2013), Embase (1980 to Nov 19, 2013), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (issue 11, 2013), for randomised controlled trials of surgery compared with placebo treatment, non-operative treatment, or no treatment, in any language, in human adults with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. We found no high-quality evidence examining the effectiveness of surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Therefore, we chose to do a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with best conservative care.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial to show the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy in treating femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. We have shown that patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome have better hip-related quality of life at 12 months since randomisation with either hip arthroscopy or best conservative care (personalised hip therapy), and that this quality of life improves significantly more in patients treated hip arthroscopy, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference. Hip arthroscopy was also more expensive than was personalised hip therapy.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Over the past 15 years, increasing numbers of patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome have been treated with hip arthroscopy. This is the first study to show that hip arthroscopy is more clinically effective, at least in the short term, than best conservative care. Longer-term outcomes are required to establish whether this improvement is sustained and whether surgery is cost-effective.

Hip arthroscopy was done under general anaesthesia in a lateral or supine position. Arthroscopic portals were established in the central and peripheral compartments of the hip under radiographic guidance according to the surgeon's usual practice. Shape abnormalities and consequent labral and cartilage pathology were treated. Adequacy of bony reshaping was assessed by intraoperative image intensifier views or by arthroscopic visualisation of a satisfactory impingement free range of movement of the hip, or both. Patients were allowed home when they could walk safely with crutches (typically within 24 h). Patients were referred to outpatient physiotherapy services for a course of rehabilitation as per usual care for that surgeon. These post-operative physiotherapists were distinct from those providing conservative care, to avoid contamination between groups. Patients had MRI of their hip at least 6 weeks after surgery.</p><p id="para190">A panel of international experts assessed the fidelity of the surgery (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).

We did prespecified subgroup analyses for different impingement types (cam, pincer, and mixed) and for patients younger and older than 40 years. We added pairwise interaction terms between treatment group and both impingement type and age group to the mixed-effects model to test for important subgroup effects. In addition to the primary adjusted analysis, we also reported unadjusted differences between groups, and we assessed significance using <italic>t</italic> tests for normally distributed outcomes. We present treatment effect estimates from the adjusted mixed-effects model (primary analysis) with 95% CIs. All hypothesis testing was at the 5% level, with no adjustments for multiple testing. Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis of secondary outcomes followed the same modelling approach as for the primary outcome. All analyses were on a complete-case basis and where follow-up data were missing, the reasons for missing data were obtained and patterns were investigated to judge the plausibility of missingness assumptions. We did a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation techniques (imputation using chained equations) to assess the effect of missing data on the primary outcome. Finally, we did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the effect of variation in recovery time in the hip arthroscopy group.

This is a statistically significant difference that also exceeded the minimum clinically important difference for iHOT-33. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hip arthroscopy is more clinically effective than best conservative care.</p><p id="para370">There have been many observational studies showing benefit from hip arthroscopy; however, these studies generally did not have control groups for comparison, and are at high risk of bias.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Results from a Cochrane systematic review done by members of our group<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> showed that there had been no previous relevant randomised controlled trials.

This finding could either be because treatment for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome does not have an effect on health-related quality of life or because the measures we used are not sufficiently sensitive to detect the changes that occur. A further possibility is that the trial was not sufficiently powered to detect changes in health-related quality of life.</p><p id="para390">Adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were more frequent than in the personalised hip therapy group.

However, our economic models were only able to assess cost-effectiveness at 12 months from randomisation. This finding must also be set in the context of the high initial treatment costs of hip arthroscopy, the treatment timing (long delay in patients receiving hip arthroscopy, reducing the period of potential benefit during follow-up), and the period of economic inactivity during postoperative recovery (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). There could be long-term benefits from treatment that were not assessed in this economic analysis. We plan further follow-up points at 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, which will inform the lifetime cost-effectiveness of both surgery and personalised hip therapy, and whether treatment effects are maintained or if further treatments are required.

The large number of centres (n=23), surgeons (n=27), and physiotherapists (n=43) involved is a strength, which contributes to the generalisability of our findings. The comparator for this trial was personalised hip therapy, which we consider to be the best conservative care that can realistically be provided in the NHS for these patients.

A blinded allocation trial, with a placebo control, would have been better suited to measuring the underlying effect of surgery. In our trial, the research question was whether hip arthroscopy or best conservative care was the most effective treatment strategy, leading to an inevitable absence of blinding. Data collection and analysis were done without revealing treatment allocation. An unexpected difficulty was the frequent delay in delivery of surgery for those patients allocated to hip arthroscopy. We had anticipated that this delay would be less than 3 months in most patients because when we designed the trial, there was a strongly enforced NHS target to treat patients within 18 weeks from referral to surgery. In fact, during the study, this target was a challenge in many hospitals. Patients allocated to hip arthroscopy therefore often had longer times to treatment, and because the primary outcome was measured 12 months after randomisation, these patients were often still within a few months (and in some cases a few weeks) of their operation when we measured the primary outcome. Because of these delays, patients in the hip arthroscopy group had, on average, less time to recover before the primary outcome measurement than did patients in the personalised hip therapy group. We compared the outcome of hip arthroscopy participants who had surgery in the first 6 months after randomisation with those who had surgery in the second 6 months. There was no significant difference between these groups, suggesting that the systematic difference in time to treatment between groups does not account for the treatment effect. Our inferences about the effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with personalised hip therapy are limited to data collected 12 months after randomisation; long-term follow-up is required to establish if this effect is maintained and if further treatments are required.</p><p id="para430">The fact that not all surgery or personalised hip therapy was deemed to be of a high fidelity is also a reflection of the real-world setting in which this trial was done. Some surgery was not satisfactory, and some participants allocated to personalised hip therapy did not engage with it or complete it: our fidelity assessment showed high-fidelity treatment in 87% of patients receiving hip arthroscopy and 70% of patients receiving personalised hip therapy. However, these proportions are comparable with other studies and reflect the pragmatism of our trial.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> We took great effort to minimise crossover in our trial, using techniques developed in our feasibility study. No participants allocated to receive hip arthroscopy received personalised hip therapy; 14 participants allocated to personalised hip therapy subsequently changed their mind and decided to have surgery within 12 months. We do not believe that these crossovers can account for the results of this trial; indeed, we would expect such crossovers to dilute and so reduce our estimate of the real underlying effect of hip arthroscopy.</p><p id="para440">Personalised hip therapy is believed to work by improving muscle control, strength around the hip, and movement patterns, leading to the avoidance of hip impingement. Surgery is thought to work by reshaping the bone to prevent impingement and by treating painful injuries to articular cartilage and labrum. In our trial, the observed effect of hip arthroscopy over conservative care might be attributable to the surgical procedure, the placebo effect of surgery (given the unblinded nature of this trial), post-surgical rehabilitation, or a combination of these factors. The results of our subgroup analysis of patients with only cam morphology are suggestive of an increased treatment effect of hip arthroscopy compared with other shapes. This finding would support the idea that the removal of a cam shape has a specific therapeutic effect. The low number of patients with pincer or mixed cam and pincer morphology in this study means we are less certain about the influence of reshaping the acetabular rim. Ultimately, we do not fully understand the mechanism of benefit from hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy. Future research should focus on investigating these mechanisms further, and which patients would benefit most from hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy.</p><p id="para450">We have shown that offering hip arthroscopy to patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome led to better patient-assessed function 12 months after randomisation, compared with best conservative care. This improvement comes at a cost; our study does not show cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with conservative care within the first 12 months.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list

the trial. We are grateful to the members of the trial steering committee, data monitoring and safety committee, and members of the UK FASHIoN Study Group for their contributions to this study. UK FASHIoN was jointly sponsored by the University of Warwick and the University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. This work is supported by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the NIHR (feasibility and pilot trial grant number 10/41/02, full trial grant number 13/103/02). The UK Comprehensive Research Network also supported this trial. JLD is supported by the MRC ConDuCT Hub for Trials Methodology Research (MR/K025643/1), and the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) West at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, and is an NIHR Senior Investigator (NF-SI-0507-10213). SP is an NIHR Senior Investigator (NF-SI-0616-10103). NEF is an NIHR Senior Investigator, and was supported through an NIHR Research Professorship (NIHR-RP-011-015). This project benefited from facilities funded through Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform, with support from Advantage West Midlands and the Wolfson Foundation. The views expressed are those of the authors, and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, or the Department of Health.</p></sec></ack><ack><title>Contributors</title><p>DRG, PDHW, RH, NEF, CEH, JLD, AR, and SP did the feasibility and pilot trial and wrote the grant application for this trial. DRG was the chief investigator. NEF and PDHW led development of personalised hip therapy intervention, and NEF, JS, and EJD supported participating physiotherapists in its delivery. EJD and RH were responsible for administrative set-up and performance of the trial, and centre staff training. CEH and EJD were responsible for collating and analysing the radiological data. NRP and JG provided statistical input to design, performance, and analysis of the trial. SP and FA designed and did the health economic analysis. AR, MJ, and JLD did the qualitative research recruitment intervention. DRG, JG, and NRP had access to all study data. DRG drafted the final report; all of the FASHIoN investigators have been involved in revising the report, and all of the authors have seen and approved the final version. DRG is the guarantor for this study and decided to submit the manuscript.</p></ack><ack><title>Trial steering committee</title><p>Ashley Blom (chair), Richard Villar, Alan Girling, Jeremy Fry, David Ralph, Ceri Jones, and Graham Hewitt.</p></ack><ack><title>Data monitoring committee</title><p>Lee Shepstone (chair), Simon Donell, and Nicholas Mohtadi.</p></ack><ack><title>UK FASHIoN Study Group</title></ack><ack><title>Administrative staff: Siobhan Stevens, Elke Gemperle-Mannion, and Jaclyn Brown (Warwick Clinical Trials Unit).
