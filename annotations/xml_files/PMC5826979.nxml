Targeting information pertinent to this cohort via a frequently asked question (FAQ) format could improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>We identified and prioritized colorectal cancer information for men and women aged 35 to 74 years (study 1) and built a website containing FAQs ordered by age and gender. In study 2, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether targeted FAQs were more influential on intention to act on CRC risk than the same information accessed via a generic topic list.

Free-text responses were categorized as FAQs: the top 5 issues within each of the 6 cohorts were identified. Study 2 (N=240) compared the impact of presentation as targeted FAQ links to information with links presented as a generic list (LIST) and a CONTROL (no information) condition. We also tested preference for presentation of access to information as FAQ or LIST by adding a CHOICE condition (a self-selected choice of FAQs or a list of information topics).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Study 1 showed considerable consistency in information priorities among all 6 cohorts with 2 main concerns: treatment of CRC and risk factors. Some differences included a focus on general risk factors, excluding diet and lifestyle, in the younger cohort, and on the existence of a test for CRC in the older cohorts. Study 2 demonstrated that, although respondents preferred information access ordered by FAQs over a list, presentation in this format had limited impact on readiness to act on colorectal cancer risk compared with the list or a no-information control (<italic>P</italic>=.06). Both FAQ and LIST were evaluated as equally usable. Those aged 35 to 49 years rated the information less relevant to them and others in their age group, and information ordered by FAQs was rated, across all age groups and both sexes, as less relevant to people outside the age group targeted within the FAQs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>FAQs are preferred over a list as a strategy for presenting access to information about CRC. They may improve intention to act on risk, although further research is required.

Developing countries have the highest incidence, although only 46% of cases worldwide occur in developing countries [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Consequently, health providers need to develop engaging, efficacious, and cost-effective informational and educational communication strategies to decrease incidence through appropriate prevention and to assist patients, survivors, and their supporters. Developing an approach to providing the myriad of information materials that can address these needs, in a format that does not confuse the intended user, is challenging. Effective, acceptable, self-tailored engagement is likely to be best achieved by use of a well-designed, internet-delivered, interactive package targeted to the needs of different users.</p><p>Research suggests that Australians and health consumers in many other countries are happy to seek health information on the Web [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although estimates of internet access vary, and accuracy can be questioned, estimates suggest that on July 1, 2016, approximately 3.4 billion people, or 46% of the population of the world, had access to the internet at home [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; this is a 7.5% increase from 2015. In the Oceania region, which includes Australia, internet penetration was estimated at 73.2%, and, within Australia alone, it was estimated at 92.1% in June 2016 [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>US data from a nationwide survey of more than 3000 people suggest that 72% of American internet users looked on the Web for health information in 2012 [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2010, a survey by the British United Provident Association (BUPA), a leading medical health insurance company, indicated that approximately 80% of Australians &#x0201c;sometimes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;often&#x0201d; used the internet to &#x0201c;search for advice about health, medicines or medical conditions&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This result compared with a high of approximately 95% of BUPA members in Russia and a low of 61% in France.</p><p>Consistent with these findings are results from a study in which we surveyed 8762 Australians aged 50 to 74 years about their health-related internet use [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Approximately 82% reported having internet access and 61% of this group reported actively seeking health-related information on the Web. Demographic variables influenced access and use; younger, more educated people had greater access and women were more likely to search the internet for health information.</p><p>These findings suggest that different demographic groups might respond differently to health information available on the internet. Optimizing presentation format and content so that they appeal to the needs of diverse groups is a challenge. Research in cognitive psychology highlights the importance of cognitive fit with, for example, differential effectiveness for tables and figures, although the differences are moderated by task difficulty (eg, [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Research in cognition also indicates that the ability to process different sorts of information varies with age and sex (eg, [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]).</p><p>These observations indicate the importance of careful consideration of webpage format in the development of Web-based health information sites so that these accommodate subgroup preferences for information provision. Yardley et al [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] assessed user reactions to an internet-delivered, health care intervention by asking participants (n=21) to &#x0201c;think aloud&#x0201d; while viewing paper versions of draft webpages and asked another group (n=26) to do the same while viewing the prototype website developed based on initial feedback. This feedback, and best practice principles, resulted in information being structured so that quantity of text on any one page was minimized, individuals were able to review information seen as personally relevant, and were able to choose what they viewed. The authors concluded as follows: &#x0201c;&#x02026;our findings suggest that educational level may not be an insuperable barrier to appreciating web-based access to in-depth self-care information, <italic>provided the users can feel they have sufficient choice and control and can quickly gain access to the specific information they value"</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Strategies for achieving personalized health information provision on the Web require site developers to identify the information needs of those who will use the website before them accessing the site, and to create pages that are targeted to these needs and evaluated as usable and acceptable. The optimal structure for these pages remains to be determined, but there is some limited support for the use of frequently asked questions (FAQs). For example, Coleman et al [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared postings on a pancreatic cancer website maintained by Johns Hopkins Hospital before and after the addition of an FAQ module. Comparison of 597 postings recorded pre and post the upload of the FAQs module indicated that the upload was associated with a significant increase in the seeking of information.</p><p>If carefully constructed according to the information needs of different segments of the population, FAQs can offer targeting of information to cohorts based on broad demographic characteristics such as gender and age. Both of these variables have been linked with differences in help-seeking and other health behaviors (eg, [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) and highlight potential differences in information needs.</p></sec><sec><title>Project Aims</title><p>This paper describes results from 2 linked studies conducted in 2013.

The project was not prospectively entered into a trial registry because it was designed as a pilot and feasibility study to inform the development of a larger, population-based, randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of a Web-based informational intervention to influence colorectal cancer-preventive behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1: What Do People Who Vary by Age and Gender Want to Know About Bowel Cancer?</title><p>The first study identified the colorectal cancer information needs of population subgroups distinguished by age and sex.</p><sec><title>Study 1: Recruitment</title><p>A market research company was employed to recruit 600 men and women in South Australia who completed a Web-based survey in May 2013. The sample consisted of 300 males and females spread evenly between 3 age bands: 35 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and 60 to 74 years. Participants were paid an honorarium of AUD $50. Informed consent was assumed by the fact that participants completed the survey.</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1: Procedure</title><p>The following question was asked to each participant. &#x0201c;If someone said to you that colorectal cancer (also known as bowel cancer) is a leading cause of death in Australia, what would be [up to] five things you would like to know more about?&#x0201d; We included the alternative term of &#x0201c;bowel cancer&#x0201d; to align with recommendations that presentation of health information materials should allow for potentially low levels of health literacy and use plain language [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] rather than scientific terminology associated with what might be an unfamiliar topic [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1: Analysis</title><p>Responses to the question were extracted verbatim from the dataset. Where an item contained multiple concepts, they were separated and treated as individual responses. These were initially coded into 13 separate information categories. A second person reviewed the initial coding and indicated any disagreement. Disagreements were arbitrated by the second author. Coding agreement was high (98.3%). Questions within each category were totaled to enable comparison of frequency of each information need. Respondents were grouped by age band (35-49, 50-59, and 60-74 years) and sex for analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study 2: Impact of the Organizational Structure of the Information on Intention to Act on Colorectal Cancer Risk and Ratings of Website Acceptability and Relevance</title><p>The second study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing reactions to information access presented as FAQs versus a simple list.

Participants were randomized into 4 groups (30 males and 30 females in each). Randomization was conducted using the preallocated ID numbers, which were block randomized by the market research company. Participants were allocated to groups according to the ID number entered when they logged in. They were blind to interventions other than that to which they were assigned. The 4 groups were defined by the format of access to colorectal cancer information provision: (1) FAQs; (2) a list of information topics (hereafter called LIST); (3) a self-selected choice of FAQs or LIST (hereafter referred to as CHOICE); and (4) a control group that received no information (CONTROL). Participants in the control group were directed to the postintervention survey. As for study 1, we used the more common vernacular of &#x0201c;bowel&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;colorectal&#x0201d; cancer [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The FAQs website opened with a page entitled &#x0201c;Prevention of Bowel Cancer&#x0201d; and provided 6 icons that could be clicked on to &#x0201c;Get answers to some of the most Frequently Asked Questions by people in certain age groups.&#x0201d; Each icon included a picture of a man or woman selected to be representative of the age group together with words identifying gender and age (eg, &#x0201c;I am a woman aged 35-49&#x0201d;). Clicking on the icon took the participant to a page that provided a further link to information to satisfy the top information needs of this group as identified in study 1. This page started with the &#x0201c;five most frequently asked questions&#x0201d; for the specified cohort and associated links to answers and was followed below by links to &#x0201c;OTHER questions asked&#x02026;&#x0201d; This latter set of questions was also ordered by order of importance as identified in study 1.</p><p>The LIST website was also entitled &#x0201c;Prevention of Bowel Cancer.&#x0201d; It was followed by the statement, &#x0201c;The information I want about bowel cancer is&#x02026;&#x0201d; and a list of 10 links ordered according to the chronology of cancer diagnosis and treatment, with the exception of prevention being included at the end.</p><p>The CHOICE website included both the LIST of information links and the FAQs icons on the initial page with the instruction &#x0201c;Get answers to some of the most Frequently Asked Questions by people in certain age-groups, or view a list of categories of information about bowel cancer&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>). The location of the icons and the list was balanced so that half (n=30) of group 3 (CHOICE) respondents (n=60) viewed the icons on the right side of the screen and the list on the left, whereas the other half viewed the reverse order (subsequent analysis indicated that presentation of FAQs on the right or left of the screen had no impact on choice between LIST AND FAQs). Once a selection had been made, participants were treated as though they were assigned to the FAQs or LIST condition.</p><p>Hyperlinks to information displayed for each intervention group led to a single underlying library that contained material designed to address discrete topics as they were selected by the user. The selected material was displayed in an identical manner regardless of the intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Post Intervention</title><p>An endpoint survey followed the intervention immediately. Respondents were again asked about their readiness to act on their risk for colorectal cancer.

The critical task for effective information provision on the Web, thus, becomes identifying relevant and salient information to address the needs of diverse population groups and providing access to information in a structure and format that maximizes perceived relevance and likelihood of action.</p><p>Study 1 indicated significant consistency in areas of interest about colorectal cancer, regardless of sex and age. Treatment and risk factors were of interest to more than 50% of the study sample (54.3% (326/600) and 50.3% (302/600), respectively), regardless of sex and age, with resources for survivors and carers least frequently identified. Additionally, a large number of participants indicated an interest in survival statistics, an information topic not generally highlighted on websites. Our own review of information available to those impacted by cancer confirms that the focus is usually on the initial diagnosis and treatment stage of the cancer survivorship continuum, with a paucity of information relating to the later stages [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of the top 5 categories between groups suggested that prevention was of least interest to the oldest cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, interest in a test for bowel cancer was most frequently expressed by those in the oldest cohort. Furthermore, comparison between groups of their evaluation of the personal (and age-group) relevance of the websites confirmed least perceived relevance in the youngest cohort, although this group could see the relevance for others outside their age group. Together, these findings are consistent with an interpretation that suggests personal relevance is likely dictated by personal experience and life-stage. This result warrants further consideration, but it suggests that young people need to be encouraged to prioritize an understanding of cancer and cancer prevention early in life. Similarly, an interest in symptom identification was endorsed by all groups as a priority, with the exception of the younger male cohort. Other research has highlighted the less frequent participation in passive detection of cancer symptoms among young men (eg, [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]).</p><p>As noted, these findings are consistent with the well-documented gender and age differences in ratings of likelihood of using health services, for both psychological (eg, [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) and physical problems (eg, [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Additionally, stronger commitment to health by women is consistent with a stronger, documented utilization of the Web for health and a more positive assessment of that information by women [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of preference for access to information targeted by gender and age (FAQs) versus nontargeted information provision (LIST) provided some support for the potential utility of targeted FAQs, with those in the CHOICE group overwhelmingly more likely to self-select the FAQ format than a general list. This may be because the FAQ &#x0201c;buttons&#x0201d; were more visually appealing&#x02014;further work is required to deconstruct how people respond to information presented on a webpage and the relative importance of visual appeal, perceived relevance, and amount of information. Comparison of total scores on a measure of perceived usability and acceptability indicated that both FAQs and LIST information access routes were viewed as highly useable and acceptable. Subsequent analysis of ratings of relevance and likelihood of recommendation indicated that group, age, and gender had only a minor influence on these ratings; women rated the information they were exposed to as more relevant to people outside their age group than men, and younger people saw the information as less relevant to them and their peers.</p><p>Although there was no statistically significant difference between FAQ, LIST, or CONTROL groups on readiness to act on colorectal cancer risk at study end, a difference approaching significance (<italic>P</italic>=.06) suggests the need for further research. When viewed together with the data on preference for FAQs over LIST displayed by those responding to the choice condition, these findings suggest that FAQs may hold some promise as a strategy to facilitate interaction with information on the Web. Given the seeming ubiquity of their use on the Web, further identifying their impact on both intention to act and health behavior is important.</p><p>The importance of identifying optimum ways to provide credible and authentic cancer prevention and support advice on the Web is great, given the seeming ubiquity of internet use in the proactive search for information [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This has resulted in an argument for increased involvement of health professionals in the design, dissemination, and evaluation of information posted on websites [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Notwithstanding the importance of this aim, the impact of health messages identified by consumers on the Web will be impacted by their internet media literacy [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the strategies they use to interact with the information available on a website [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Findings from studies that have explored these strategies confirm the importance of user control of information flow [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The study has several limitations. Participants were self-selected insofar that they had registered with a market research company as willing to be approached to complete surveys, and so may not be representative of the general population. Intention to reduce risk of colorectal cancer, rather than actual behavior, was measured and, because this information was captured immediately following the intervention, we were unable to ascertain whether the effect was maintained over time and translated to action. Further research could usefully investigate whether the intervention resonated with participants if the survey was administered 1 month following the intervention and actual behavior was captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, few studies have examined whether the way in which access to health information is organized on the Web influences intended behavior or ratings of perceived relevance. Our results show some promising support for an organizational structure for cancer information access that uses age and gender as the organizing principle. These data are based on a small sample and reflect cross-sectional associations. Future research should examine how organization of access to information on the Web impacts on future health behavior as well as on endorsement and recommendation of a website to others. Further simplification of content and more complex and nuanced strategies for targeting (eg, by family health history, current health status, and other demographic variables) might achieve better outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Elizabeth Hart and Joe Miller for assisting with coding of participant responses.
