We aimed to assess whether tranexamic acid reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcome in adults with stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did an international, randomised placebo-controlled trial in adults with intracerebral haemorrhage from acute stroke units at 124 hospital sites in 12 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8 h infusion of 1 g tranexamic acid or a matching placebo, within 8 h of symptom onset. Randomisation was done centrally in real time via a secure website, with stratification by country and minimisation on key prognostic factors. Treatment allocation was concealed from patients, outcome assessors, and all other health-care workers involved in the trial. The primary outcome was functional status at day 90, measured by shift in the modified Rankin Scale, using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for stratification and minimisation criteria. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN93732214.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>We recruited 2325 participants between March 1, 2013, and Sept 30, 2017. 1161 patients received tranexamic acid and 1164 received placebo; the treatment groups were well balanced at baseline.

To identify further published, ongoing, and unpublished randomised controlled trials we scanned bibliographies of relevant articles and searched international registers of clinical trials in Nov 27, 2017. We searched for trials in all languages. The quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. We found two small randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid with a total of 54 participants, with no clear evidence of benefit or harm associated with tranexamic acid. Five further randomised controlled trials are ongoing.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para80">TICH-2 is, to our knowledge, the first large multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial of tranexamic acid in acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. It included an older population than in previous tranexamic acid trials after trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid was not associated with any significant improvement in functional outcome at 90 days, despite a significant reduction in the number of participants with haematoma expansion and fewer deaths by days 2 and 7 among those allocated tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid was safe, with fewer serious adverse events and no increase in thromboembolic events compared with placebo.</p><p id="para90"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para100">Although there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid in clinical practice for spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, the results do not exclude a possible small effect. The reductions in haematoma expansion and early deaths are promising, but larger randomised trials are needed to confirm or refute a clinically significant treatment effect. Future research should also investigate which subgroups of patients are most likely to benefit.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para110">Therefore, the Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Haemorrhage (TICH-2) trial tested the hypothesis that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces death and dependence when given within 8 h of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para120">TICH-2 was an international double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 3 trial. Participants were enrolled by investigators from acute stroke units at 124 hospital sites in 12 countries: Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. Ethics approval was obtained at each site and country before the start of the study. The trial was adopted in the UK by the National Institute Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network and registered as ISRCTN93732214.

A secure website was used to randomly assign all participants eligible for inclusion to receive tranexamic acid or matching placebo, with 1:1 allocation. The random allocation sequence was generated by the trial programmer. Randomisation was stratified by country, with minimisation for key prognostic factors: age, sex, time since onset, systolic blood pressure, stroke severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), presence of intraventricular haemorrhage, and known history of antiplatelet treatment use immediately before stroke onset.</p><p id="para160">Sharp Clinical Services (Crickhowell, UK) prepared individual masked treatment packs containing four 5 mL glass ampoules of tranexamic acid 500 mg or sodium chloride 0&#x000b7;9%, which were made identical in appearance by the addition of a heat shrink sleeve. Ampoules and the treatment pack were labelled with a unique pack number. Sharp Clinical Services stored the treatment packs and distributed them to pharmacies within trial sites using a web-based system of control. The pharmacy at each participating site received numbered supplies from Sharp Clinical Services. The packs were stored at room temperature and protected from excessive heat and freezing in a restricted access area (more detail is provided in the protocol). The randomisation system allocated each participant a unique number corresponding to a treatment pack containing either tranexamic acid or placebo. Treatment allocation was concealed from all staff and patients involved in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para170">The intervention, tranexamic acid, was given intravenously as a 1 g loading dose in 100 mL normal saline 0&#x000b7;9% infused over 10 min, followed by another 1 g in 250 mL normal saline 0&#x000b7;9%, which was infused over 8 h. The comparator was a matching placebo (normal saline 0&#x000b7;9%), administered with an identical regimen.</p><p id="para180">At randomisation, investigators recorded the participants' age, sex, and medical history, as well as their assessment of intracerebral haemorrhage location, intraventricular haemorrhage, and spot sign. Investigators assessed prestroke dependence with the mRS, and stroke severity using the NIHSS and Glasgow Coma Scale. Participants were reviewed at day 2, day 7, and on the day of death or hospital discharge, whichever came first, to gather information on clinical assessment (NIHSS), the process of care measures (eg, blood pressure lowering treatment, neurosurgical intervention), and discharge date and destination (eg, home or institution).</p><p id="para190">Adherence was assessed by examining the participant's drug chart and recording the trial treatment administered at day 2 (ie, whether all treatment was given, the time and date of the two doses, and any other comments). Adherence was verified by both central review of the drug chart and pharmacies recording returns of residual or unused trial medications.</p><p id="para200">Central assessors, who were trained and certified in administration of the mRS and masked to treatment allocation, did the final follow-up at 90 days by telephone from the coordinating centre in each country. If the participant or carer could not be contacted, they received a questionnaire covering the same outcome measures by post.</p><p id="para210">Brain imaging by CT was done as part of routine care before enrolment; a second research CT scan was done after 24 h of treatment to assess haematoma expansion. When multiple scans were done, the scan closest to 24 h after randomisation was used. Central independent expert assessors, who were masked to treatment assignment, assessed CT scans for the location of the intracerebral haemorrhage using a web-based adjudication system. Semi-automated segmentation of the intracerebral haemorrhage was done on Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-compliant images to give intracerebral haemorrhage volumes. The user-guided three-dimensional active contour tool<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> in the ITK-SNAP software (version 3.6) was used for segmentation and one of three assessors did manual editing as required. All assessments were masked to treatment assignment. Haematoma expansion was defined as an absolute increase of more than 6 mL or a relative growth of greater than 33%.</p><p id="para220">As part of standard routine care, participants received blood pressure lowering treatment, neurosurgery, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis as appropriate, in accordance with clinical guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="para230">The primary outcome was functional status at day 90, as assessed with the mRS, which was administered by telephone or postal questionnaire and masked to treatment allocation.

Although this finding could be due to chance, it is also compatible with the notion that patients with moderately sized haematomas might be more likely to benefit from tranexamic acid, and hence could be targeted for future studies, as has been postulated with recombinant factor VIIa.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p id="para480">The strengths of this study include its double-blinding, allocation concealment, low risk of bias, high adherence to treatment, and very few missing data on primary outcomes. Treatment groups were well balanced for baseline factors. The use of approved brief and proxy consent processes allowed the rapid enrolment of patients without the capacity to consent, which is important to avoid bias in acute stroke studies. Our inclusion criteria were deliberately broad to reflect the clinical population and to facilitate recruitment from multiple international sites. Nevertheless, most participants were recruited from the UK. The study had several other limitations. We did not collect screening logs so are unable to present data on eligibility. Wide inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population with more severe strokes, larger haematoma volumes, and a greater proportion of lobar haematomas and intraventricular haemorrhage than populations in other intracerebral haemorrhage trials,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> which could have diluted any potential treatment effect. Finally, despite efforts to ensure rapid treatment, most participants were enrolled more than 3 h after the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage, which could explain the absence of a significant interaction with time in the subgroup analysis.</p><p id="para490">Several smaller randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid in intracerebral haemorrhage are ongoing (STOP-MSU [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT03385928" id="interrefs10">NCT03385928</ext-link>], STOP-AUST [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01702636" id="interrefs20">NCT01702636</ext-link>], TRAIGE [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02625948" id="interrefs30">NCT02625948</ext-link>], TRANSACT [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT03044184" id="interrefs40">NCT03044184</ext-link>], and TICH-NOAC [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02866838" id="interrefs50">NCT02866838</ext-link>]; total enrolment is fewer than 1000 participants across the trials), and a meta-analysis of individual patient data is planned.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Future trials would need to enrol far more patients to allow the detection of a small treatment effect, or enrich their population with patients at greatest risk of haematoma expansion, primarily by treating patients earlier.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Although patients presenting early are at greater risk of haematoma expansion, they also have more severe strokes and larger haematoma volumes.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Identification of patients most likely to benefit from haemostatic therapy on the basis of factors other than time of onset has been suggested,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> but enrichment with the CTA spot sign has yet to be successful.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p><p id="para500">In summary, tranexamic acid did not affect functional status at day 90, although potential benefits were seen with reductions in haematoma expansion, early death, and serious adverse events. The observed effect size was smaller than anticipated and is compatible with a lack of efficacy or the presence of a smaller treatment effect than expected. Future research should investigate which subgroups of patients might benefit. Tranexamic acid is inexpensive, easy to administer, seems to be safe, and is widely available, so even a modest treatment effect could have an important impact on the global scale. Larger randomised trials are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van Asch</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Luitse</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rinkel</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Tweel</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Algra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Klijn</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence, case fatality, and functional outcome of intracerebral haemorrhage over time, according to age, sex, and ethnic origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>Lancet Neurol</source><volume>9</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>167</fpage><lpage>176</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20056489</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Heeley</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rapid blood-pressure lowering in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>368</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>2355</fpage><lpage>2365</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23713578</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>B&#x000f6;sel</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Options to restrict hematoma expansion after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage</article-title><source>Stroke</source><volume>41</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>402</fpage><lpage>409</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20044536</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brott</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Broderick</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kothari</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Early hemorrhage growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage</article-title><source>Stroke</source><volume>28</volume><year>1997</year><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8996478</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kazui</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Naritomi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawada</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamaguchi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Enlargement of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.
