Our findings confirm that PGA plus stent placement is more effective in preventing post-ESD esophageal stricture compared with stent placement alone in EC patients with early-stage disease.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common carcinomas with high mortality and has been identified as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Based on 2015 global cancer statistics, an estimated 455800 new EC cases and 400200 deaths occurred in 2012. In the United States, approximately 16940 new EC cases and 15690 deaths will be seen in 2017[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), performed as an endoscopic resection technique, has been widely utilized in the treatment of EC patients with early-stage disease, due to its minimal invasiveness and high rate of <italic>en bloc</italic> resection[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, more than 30% of EC patients after ESD still experience postoperative esophageal stricture, which is characterized by dysphagia, dramatically decreasing the quality of life[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>To prevent post-ESD esophageal stricture, various treatments have been implemented, such as polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet, stent placement, and esophageal balloon dilatation[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among these, PGA sheet, a biodegradable suture material, could be used to prevent post-ESD esophageal stricture because of its advantages of reinforcing suture and minimal scar contracture, although the limitation of instability between the PGA sheet and wound surface after long-term pasting still exists[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another popular method is stent placement, which is frequently used with covered self-expandable metal material, and has been verified to have curative effects on refractory stricture to some extent, although its complications, such as translocation and promotion of granulation tissue proliferation, still affect its clinical outcomes in EC patients[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although some studies on the applications of combinations of two or three treatments in the prevention of esophageal stricture after ESD have been performed, no study has explored the effect of the combination of PGA and stent placement in the prevention of post-ESD esophageal stricture[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of PGA plus stent placement compared with stent placement alone in the prevention of post-ESD esophageal stricture in early-stage EC patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 70 early-stage EC patients receiving ESD at Department of Gastroenterology, China PLA General Hospital from July 2016 to May 2017 were consecutively enrolled in this randomized controlled study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Circumferential range above 3/4; (2) Longitudinal length above 3 cm; (3) Lesion depth no more than M2; and (4) Tumor lesion could be completely removed. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients with coagulative dysfunction, hepatic failure, renal failure, or cardiopulmonary dysfunction; (2) Patients complicated with malignant hematological disease or other solid tumors; (3) Patients who had a previous history of esophagectomy or radiation therapy; (4) Patients who were unable to complete the ESD operation; (5) Pregnant or lactating women; (6) Patients who could not be followed regularly; and (7) Patients who refused to participate in this study.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of China PLA General Hospital (approval No. S2016-059-01), and all participants provided written informed consent. This study was registered on <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn">http://www.chictr.org.cn</uri> (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry conducted by World Health Organization; registration No. chictr-inr-16008709).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization code was generated by a statistician using the blocked randomization method with block length set as four because of the need for allocation balance between the two groups (1:1 ratio). The documents were subsequently sent and kept in Shanghai Qeejen Bio-tech Company (a medical and statistical service company). After screening, when a patient was eligible for the study, a call was made to the Qeejen Company, and a unique subject identification number was provided from the randomized module.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>After the randomization, patients were allocated to the PGA plus stent treatment group or stent treatment group at a 1:1 ratio. In the PGA plus stent group, the patients received PGA sheet-coated stent placement to prevent esophageal stricture post ESD operation; in the stent group, the patients received only stent placement to prevent esophageal stricture post ESD operation.</p></sec><sec><title>ESD procedure</title><p>After intravenous anesthesia, patients with tracheal intubation and oropharyngeal tube placement underwent endoscope (Olympus, Japan) insertion to the area of the tumor lesion. Subsequently, the lesion margins were stained with iodine, and the submucosa was labeled. Then, the lesion dissections were performed, and endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection was used for lesion stripping, followed by hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Combination of PGA membrane and stent</title><p>According to the ESD wound length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), the length of stent (Derman Science, China, 1.7 cm of diameter, stainless steel, silicone rubber membrane) was selected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), followed by PGA sheet selection (NEOVEIL, Japan, 100 mm &#x000d7; 100 mm &#x000d7; 0.15 mm) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Subsequently, the stent was coated with the PGA sheet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), and the covered place was designed to the ESD wound site after stent release. Then, this stent covered with a PGA sheet was mounted on the conveyer for the esophageal stent ring supporter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and F) and inserted under endoscopic observation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Combination of polyglycolic acid sheet and stent.

Subsequently, the guide wire was placed under the endoscope, and then the endoscope was pulled out and the conveyer was inserted for the esophageal stent ring supporter along with the guide wire for the stent placement. After stent placement, the endoscope was inserted again to observe the stent position. A chest X-ray was performed after the stent placement, and the stent position was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Stent removal</title><p>In the PGA plus stent group, the stent was removed by endoscopy at 4 wk, whereas in the stent group, the stent was removed at 8 wk after operation. Endoscopic evaluation of the ESD wound was performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>-C). The time to remove the stent between the two groups was different because PGA is a biodegradable suture material, which would be degraded after a period of time. According to a preliminary study with a small sample size, we found that when PGA plus stent placement was used to prevent post-ESD esophageal stricture in early-stage EC patients, the PGA was degraded at approximately 3 or 4 wk after ESD, and therefore, the previous clinical experiences suggested that removing PGA plus stent placement at 4 wk might be a good choice in EC patients.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The management of one of the study patients.

The secondary endpoints were as follows: time to esophageal stricture; location, length, and diameter of esophageal stricture; and balloon dilatation times for the esophageal stricture.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients were followed through clinic visits or telephone interviews. Each patient was asked if dysphagia or other symptoms occurred at each visit or call, and if distinct dysphagia was determined, endoscopy was performed to examine the esophageal stricture. Chest X-ray examination was performed every 2 wk to monitor the position of esophageal stent, and if a stent shifted more than 2 cm, endoscopy was performed to adjust the stent to the original place.</p></sec><sec><title>Balloon dilatation</title><p>All patients with esophageal stricture received endoscopic balloon dilation treatment (balloon diameter: 8 mm/10 mm/12 mm/15 mm, Boston Scientific, United States). The esophageal stricture section was repeatedly dilated until the endoscope could successfully pass through at each endoscopic examination, and balloon dilation was performed every week until the endoscope could pass through the section before dilation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, United States) and OFFICE 2010 (Microsoft, United States).

Subsequently, the remaining 70 patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two groups as follows: PGA plus stent group and stent group. In the PGA plus stent group, one case withdrew during the study due to a lesion depth &#x0003e; M2 post-ESD operation, and 34 (97%) cases completed the entire study. In the stent group, there were three total withdrawals; three patients with lesion depth more than M2 after ESD operation withdrew, and 32 (91%) cases completed the entire study. Ultimately, a total of 66 EC patients completed the final analysis. After the operation, the stent was removed by endoscopy at 4 wk in the PGA plus stent group, and it was removed at 8 wk in the stent group. During the study, stent displacement was adjusted by endoscopy. Chest X-ray examination was performed every 2 wk. Endoscopy was performed to check the esophageal stricture.

Recent data indicate that the appearance of several fibroblasts and the shrinking of the natural muscle layer are present in the formation of post-ESD esophageal stricture, which suggests that fiber proliferation, scar formation, and wound contracture might contribute to the formation of post-ESD esophageal stricture[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Stenting has been regarded as a useful way to prevent post-ESD esophageal stricture, although a high recurrence rate still exists in most patients after removing the stent, and some patients with long-term stent placement experience several complications, such as displacement and granulation tissue hyperplasia[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In clinical practice, stent insertion has been reported to decrease the dysphagia score and the mean diameter of esophageal stricture[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. PGA sheet, a polymer with a fiber mesh structure, could: (1) provide abundant cytoskeletons to support cell crawling during the repair process, and inhibit rejection reaction by its strong degradative function, thereby leading to a decreased risk of scar germination and stricture formation; and (2) carry cells and medicines to promote cell repair and wound healing. An interesting study revealed that PGA sheets could shield mucosal defects and prevent scarring, reducing postoperative adverse events in patients with colorectal ESD[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, some limitations of PGA sheets still exist, which are easy to fall off for long-term utilization[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, both stents and PGA can decrease the risk of esophageal stricture to some extent. However, there remain several limitations. No study on the effects of the combined application of PGA and stent has been reported. Our study compared the occurrence rate of post-ESD esophageal stricture between the PGA plus stent and stent groups and indicated that the percentage of post-ESD esophageal stricture in the PGA plus stent group was lower compared with the stent group. Balloon dilatation, which is one of the most common treatments for esophageal stricture, has been identified to have good short-term efficacy, whereas the long-term curative effect is still far from satisfactory. A previous study suggested that the average usage rate of balloon dilatation is estimated to be 16 times for post-ESD esophageal stricture[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The results of our study also found that the balloon dilatation times for esophageal stricture in the PGA plus stent group were less than those in the stent group [4 (2-5) <italic>vs</italic> 6 (1-14) times]. Therefore, these findings indicated that PGA plus stent placement could decrease the risk of esophageal stricture and the balloon dilatation times for esophageal stricture compared with stent placement alone. Possible explanations might be as follows: (1) The stent could provide radial force to fix the PGA sheet, thereby preventing the defluvium of the PGA sheet[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; and (2) The PGA sheet could increase the friction between the stent and wound surface, reducing stent displacement, and also provide cytoskeleton and carry medicine to accelerate cell repair and wound healing. Therefore, the interaction of the PGA sheet with the stent could decrease the occurrence rate of post-ESD esophageal stricture[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, seven patients still reported the formation of esophageal stricture in the PGA plus stent group. This occurrence might be explained by the fact that during the process of wound repair, epithelial cells usually crawl from the edge of the wound to the central area. Because of the long-term repair, the PGA sheet might be degraded to result in frameless support, leading to its defluvium and increasing the occurrence rate of esophageal stricture in the central area (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>-D). As to the predictive value, the results of the present study showed that PGA plus stent placement could be an independent factor to predict a lower possibility of esophageal stricture occurrence. The possible reasons are that the stent contributes to fixing the PGA sheet and the PGA sheet increases the friction to reduce stent displacement, thereby preventing the occurrence of post-ESD esophageal stricture[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although there is no report on the effects of PGA plus stent in the prevention of post-ESD esophageal stricture in EC patients, further studies investigating other combined treatments, such as PGA plus stent plus corticosteroids, are greatly needed. Furthermore, the results of our study also found that shorter length (<italic>P</italic> = 0.080) and diameter (<italic>P</italic> = 0.061) were observed in the PGA plus stent group compared with the stent group, which suggests that the interaction of PGA and stent might decrease the severity of the degree of esophageal stricture.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>The endoscopic submucosal dissection wound before and after the polyglycolic acid sheet plus stent placement.

Although glucocorticoid injection is a good way to decrease the occurrence of systemic adverse reactions, it still leads to several complications in EC patients after ESD, including perforation, bleeding, and mediastinal abscess[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, a PGA sheet infiltrated with a glucocorticoid (triamcinolone acetonide) might decrease the occurrence of post-ESD esophageal stricture while reducing adverse reactions. Furthermore, to optimize the methods to prevent esophageal stricture, we explored the combined application of PGA, stent, and glucocorticoid in three EC patients after ESD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>-C). After stent removal, no formation of esophageal stricture occurred and good effectiveness was achieved during a 3 mo follow-up (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref> and E). However, further study with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period is necessary.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>The management of one of the study patients.
