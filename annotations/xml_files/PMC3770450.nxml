However, the effect of massage therapy on bone metabolism in adults has only scarcely been explored.</p><p>Thai Traditional massage exerts pressure on the body in a rhythmic fashion. The massage performer uses the outstretched heels of both hands to exert pressure on the body of the subject approximately once every 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;seconds for 2&#x000a0;hours. It is likely that the physical load from Thai traditional massage may induce strain in the skeleton and affect bone, similar to other means of applying mechanical load. We have demonstrated in a previous study that Thai traditional massage results in an acute anabolic effect on bone, as assessed by biochemical markers of bone turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is unclear if a longer term of massage therapy would result in similar effects. Toward this end, a randomized crossover study was employed to investigate the skeletal effect of Thai traditional massage by examining the changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A randomized crossover design was used.

After a 2-week washout period, subjects were switched to the other arm of intervention for 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Thai traditional massage was performed by a single masseuse throughout the study. Subjects were requested to change into comfortable, loose-fitting clothes and to lie flat on a firm mattress on the floor. The procedure consisted of the masseuse applying firm, rhythmic pressure over the volunteer&#x02019;s body through the heels of her hands.

Despite its common utilization, studies showing evidence of the beneficial effects of massage therapy are still limited. Thai traditional massage has been shown to reduce pain and muscle tension in patients with scapulocostal syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, in a preliminary study on the acute effects of Thai traditional massage on biochemical markers of bone turnover, we demonstrated that a single 2-hour session can acutely increase serum P1NP, a marker of bone formation by 4.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Using a randomized crossover design we demonstrated in the present study that two sessions per week of Thai traditional massage for 4&#x000a0;weeks resulted in a higher increase in P1NP, particularly in older individuals with smaller body built. The magnitude of change in P1NP from Thai traditional massage was comparable to the change in serum alkaline phosphatase in a study using vibration platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] but was much less than that achieved with parathyroid hormone, a potent bone formation agent used in the treatment of osteoporosis, which usually reaches 100% or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Osteocalcin did not change significantly in the present study despite the changes in P1NP. Studies with bone forming agents such as parathyroid hormone and sclerostin monoclonal antibody have shown that osteocalcin is a less sensitive marker in response to treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is of note that the effect of Thai traditional massage on bone formation was more apparent in postmenopausal women of older age. While the improvement in the marker of bone formation cannot readily be extrapolated to an enhancement of bone mass or reduced fracture risk, our finding at least suggests that Thai traditional massage is likely to be beneficial to bone, particularly in women of advancing age among whom osteoporosis is a common health problem.</p><p>The effect of massage on bone metabolism in adults has scarcely been explored. However, a number of studies have investigated the influence of massage on the alteration of bone growth, particularly during the postnatal period. For example, massage in the early postnatal period was found to promote lean mass and bone growth in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In humans, when combined with physical activity, massage during the peri-neonatal period improves bone formation without changes in bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our findings are in keeping with those in infants, where massage therapy results in an increase in serum P1NP but not CTX.</p><p>It is well established that mechanical load affects bone cells. The strain characteristics that determine skeletal responses include strain magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], strain frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and strain rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There appears to be an inverse relationship between strain magnitude and frequency for inducing osteogenic effects. Low-magnitude mechanical load needs to be applied at high frequency in order to have an effect equivalent to high-magnitude mechanical load at lower frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, the duration and cycle number of the loading are other factors related to the increase in osteoblast proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We showed in the present study that body height was inversely related to the increased in P1NP after Thai traditional massage. It is likely that this is partly because of tall postmenopausal women received less repetitive cyclic numbers of massage per body surface area than shorter women during the same period. In line with our previous study, we demonstrated in the present study that external periodic mechanical loading applied through Thai traditional massage is likely to have an anabolic effect on bone; this suggests that Thai traditional massage could be another option for enhancing bone health through mechanical loading.</p><p>Besides its direct effect on bone through mechanical loading, it is conceivable that Thai traditional massage may affect bone indirectly through the central nervous system. The adipokine leptin inhibits bone formation through a central nervous system delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Mechanical tactile stimulation reduces stress hormones and improves bone mineralization in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, a study using functional MRI has shown that types of massage can influence brain cortical areas differently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To what extent the effect of Thai traditional massage is due to its effect on stress hormones and the central nervous system is unknown. One of the other possible mechanisms involves ghrelin. It has been shown that ghrelin enhances bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and that massage therapy in infants increases circulating ghrelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of limitations in the present study. The sample size is relatively small and may not be able to detect small effects on bone resorption. Moreover, although the current results are consistent with those of our previous study and of other studies in infants, it is still unclear if the increase in bone formation as reflected by bone markers will result in higher bone mass or reduced fractures. It is of note that only a single masseur performed the Thai traditional massage throughout the study. The result may not be readily generalized to other masseurs. Further studies, which include multiple practitioners, to confirm our results, as well as to investigate the effect of Thai traditional massage on bone mass or fractures, are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrated that Thai traditional massage results in an increase in bone formation as assessed by serum P1NP, particularly in postmenopausal women who are older and have a smaller body build.
