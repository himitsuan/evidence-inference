PRP contains growth factors, chemokine factors, cytokine and adhesive proteins that have both mitogenic and chemotactic properties. However, evidence for the effectiveness of PRP therapy is not very conclusive and results are inconsistent. Several other approaches have numerous side effects. GFC contain more or less consistent level of natural growth factors and hence provide consistent results without any side effect.</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Facial folds are the results of aging process. Studies showed that in aged and wrinkled skin, there is an accumulation of altered elastic fibres and degradation and degeneration of collagen in the dermis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Nasolabial folds and crow feet are the first sign of facial aging. Age related changes on the face are like facial bone loss, facial soft tissue loss, dermal dystrophy, loss of subcutaneous tissue, redistribution of fat and dermal thickening that contribute to the facial folds.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There are several factors that causes age-related changes such as exposure to sunlight, nutritional habits, and hereditary factors that result in degeneration of elastic fibres, degradation of collagen and collapse of fibroblast that loses skin elasticity and resilience.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Correction of facial folds and restoration to its original shape is a key approach to rejuvenation and enhancement of facial appearance. Several surgical and non-surgical treatment modalities have been reported and currently being used regularly in the aesthetic clinics with numerous side effects. It is therefore necessary that soft tissue augmentation need safe, reliable and long-lasting alternative.</p><p>Recently, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is being used in a wide variety of clinical application.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, evidence for the effectiveness of PRP therapy is not very conclusive. Several factors like platelet concentration, growth factor levels, activation process, and time of application are severely affecting the results.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It has been observed that growth factor derived from platelets has a dose&#x02013;response relationship in proliferation of fibroblast and the production of Type-I collagen. Higher concentration of platelets inhibits the proliferation, whereas lower concentration did not show optimum results, hence different growth factor concentration may have an impact on the results that can be obtained <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Here we have developed autologous growth factor concentrate (GFC) from the fixed number of platelets and evaluated for its safety and efficacy for nasolabial folds and compared with conventional PRP in a split face clinical study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>For this study, two clinical sites in Mumbai, India and one clinical site in Madrid, Spain were selected. This study was designed and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local institutional ethics committee (IEC). Written informed consent from all the patients was obtained before participation in this study and they were informed about experimental protocol and being advised about the risks of treatment. Clinical study in India was registered with clinical trial registry of India (CTRI) no CTRI/2012/05/002627 and US clinical trial registry NCT 01644461.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was divided into two groups. In group I, total 20 subjects were enrolled with nasolabial folds and all of them received 2.5 ml of single dose of GFC on each side of the face, whereas in group II, 60 subjects were enrolled with nasolabial folds and received 2.5 ml of single dose of GFC on the right side of the face and 2.5 ml of PRP on the left side of the face as a comparator.</p><p>All subjects with nasolabial wrinkle with grade of 3&#x02013;4 were recruited during April&#x02013;June 2012 and followed them for 3 months till October 2012 at two clinical centers of Mumbai and one clinical center of Madrid, Spain. Extended post study follow-up of 6 and 12 months was carried out in January 2013 and June 2013, respectively.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were that the patient with either sex and should be aged between 35 and 65 years with grade 3 or 4 on folds severity rating scale (WSRS) (1&#x02013;5) on clinical evaluation. They must be willing to refrain from any other treatment of facial folds during the entire study.</p><p>Patients not included in the study were already undergoing aesthetic facial treatment 6 weeks prior to enrolment, patient with hematopoietic disorders or known bleeding disorders such as platelet dysfunction syndrome, thrombocytopenia or hypo-fibrinogenemia.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Isolation of GFC</title><p>Thirty-four milliliters of whole blood from each patient was drawn in vacutainer (Hindustan Syringe and Medical Devices, Faridabad, India) containing acid citrate dextrose (ACD) as anti-coagulant. Along with this 5 ml of blood was drawn in EDTA vacutainer and 5 ml was drawn in plain vacutainer for serum for patient screening. Entire collection kit with collected whole blood is kept in transport box maintained at a temperature of 20&#x02013;22<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C and transported to the central processing laboratory within 24 hours of collection. Tubes were barcoded and sent for quality testing. Blood samples were tested for complete blood count (CBC) and infectious disease markers like human immunodeficiency virus 1, 2 (HIV1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) by rapid tests before processing for GFC.</p><p>Entire process was carried out in centralized Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)-approved clean room. ACD vacutainer containing whole blood was centrifuged at 380 gravitational forces (<italic>g</italic>) for 15 minutes. The upper layer of plasma that is rich in platelets was removed in another sterile centrifuge tube leaving behind buffy coat in the middle and packed red blood cells at the bottom. PRP was centrifuged again at 2700 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. Supernatant containing platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was then removed and collected in other sterile centrifuge tube for subsequent use. Platelet-rich pellet at the bottom was then suspended in 5 ml of plasma to make platelet-rich suspension. Total platelets in the platelet-rich suspension was adjusted to 625 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> platelets/ml as a therapeutic dose for lateral epicondylitis using an automated cell counting machine (Coulter) and diluted accordingly using PPP.</p><p>The platelet-rich suspension containing 625 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> platelets/ml was then processed in GMP clean suits for isolation of growth factors.

Prior to the treatment affected skin was cleaned with antiseptic and followed by sterile saline. In order to carry out comparative analysis, digital photographs were collected for each patient. A topical anesthetic cream was applied on the skin for 45 minutes. Face was again cleaned with sterile saline. The patient was seated in the inclined position in dental chair. A 28&#x02013;30 gauge needle attached to 1 ml hypodermic syringe was used. Skin was stretched tightly before injecting the needle in the dermis. The needle was inserted into the dermis at an approximately 30<sup>&#x000b0;</sup> angle, parallel to the length of nasolabial folds or other folds. GFC was injected either by linear threading or fanning at the base of folds. 2.5 ml of GFC was injected at each side of nasolabial folds in group I patients, whereas 2.5 ml GFC and 2.5 ml of PRP was distributed on the right and left side of the face for facial folds in group II patients.</p><p>Patients were followed up for every month for the improvement up to 3 months.

This showed that both the treatments modalities are good in its way, but GFC was superior in clinical outcome compared to PRP.</p><p>Multiplex ELISA analysis demonstrated that autologous GFC contains several signaling proteins like non-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, adhesive proteins and basal proteins. The presence of such signaling proteins was reported to have favorable effects on fibroblast proliferation, cell migration and regulation of MMP and neo-collagen synthesis. We have shown that level of prominent growth factors from 625 million platelets/ml was significantly higher than calcium-activated PRP when compared with earlier reported literature.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>We have observed that GFC or PRP was found to be less effective if given to the patient above 60 years of age. It may be because of inheriting low level of growth factors in the platelets derived from the older patients (data not shown). Studies showed that GFC derived from older donors increased activity of senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase and hence supported the notion that aging is associated with systemic feedback mechanism that conversely influences cell intrinsic aging programs. Perhaps, cell intrinsic age-associated epigenetic modifications of the fibroblasts might be influenced by systemic factors and may be ineffective or less effective when treated with their own growth factors.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Perhaps in older patients higher concentration of GFC may be required for effective results.</p><p>Mechanism of action of GFC is not well studied, however, we hypothesized that TGF-&#x003b2;, EGF and bFGF are the most important growth factors and affect most aspect of tissue repair like initiation, proliferation and differentiation of dermal cells.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] GFC increases level of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 and corrects the ratio of MMP and TIMP that helps in removal of damaged collagen and stimulation of de novo collagen synthesis that may compensate for the defect that arises due to nasolabial folds and other facial folds.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Newly synthesize collagen may improve the structural integrity of the dermal ECM and stimulate fibroblast to produce more collagen.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We have also seen very high level of chemokine factors in GFC like growth-regulated oncogene-&#x003b1; (GRO-&#x003b1;) and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). These factors might be helping in mobilizing endogenous stem cells for regeneration and remodeling the tissue.</p><p>For optimum clinical results in facial wrinkle, it is likely a function of many variables that includes platelet concentration, volume of injection and severity of condition. There is no clear definition and recommendation for the fold increase of platelet concentration over baseline for optimum clinical outcome. In PRP, platelet concentration is significantly variable from patient to patient. Lower concentration of platelets may not yield optimal clinical outcome whereas higher concentration may be inhibitory for cell proliferation. The GFC prepared in this study was derived from fixed number of platelets (625 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> per ml) and therefore variation in the platelet concentration was eliminated in a larger extent. This platelet concentration was identified as a therapeutic dose after analyzing various platelet concentrations under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions using the skin fibroblast proliferation assay.</p><p>There are several current therapies for facial folds in practice including topical retinoic acid, Botulinum toxic type-A, fillers, collagen injection, and laser resurfacing and PRP. Each therapy has their limitations and side effects. We are presenting for the first time the effect of growth factors derived from the autologous platelets in the form of GFC for facial rejuvenation. In the present study, we have shown that the single injection of GFC significantly improves facial folds. These observations proved that GFC can be used as a standalone treatment for facial folds.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that a single application of GFC improves facial folds which touted it as a possible alternative as a standalone treatment. The treatment is safe and simple and there is no down time. Hence as a standalone treatment GFC should be studied for long term implications as well as on a larger population.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p><bold>What is new?</bold></p><p>Growth factor concentrate (GFC) contains consistent level of growth factors derived from the known number of the platelets for therapeutic purpose. GFC is free from cells, cell membranes and exogenous reagents and chemicals. Single application of GFC improves nasolabial fold correction which touted it as a possible alternative as a standalone treatment.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Beer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Overview of facial aging</article-title><source>Facial Plast Surg</source><year>2009</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>281</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20024868</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Glogau</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Aesthetic and anatomic analysis of the aging skin</article-title><source>Semin Cutan Med Surg</source><year>1996</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>134</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8948530</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jacovella</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Calcium hydroxylapatite facial filler (Radiesse): Indications, technique and results</article-title><source>Clin Plast Surg</source><year>2006</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>511</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17085220</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Imayama</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Takeuchi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hori</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Takema</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakaino</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Ultraviolet-B irradiation deforms the configuration of elastic fibres during the induction of actinic elastosis in rats</article-title><source>J Dermatol Sci</source><year>1994</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>32</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8193082</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Imokawa</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Takema</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Yorimoto</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsukahara</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawai</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Imayama</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Degree of ultraviolet-induced tortuosity of elastic fibres in rat skin is age dependent</article-title><source>J Invest Dermatol</source><year>1995</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>254</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7636309</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Takema</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Imokawa</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of UVA and UVB irradiation on the viscoelastic properties of hairless mouse skin <italic>in vivo</italic>
