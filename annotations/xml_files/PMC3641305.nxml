With supervision by The Stop TB Strategy, the World Health Organization (WHO) has pursued standardized treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most effective treatment has been a standard 6-month four-drug regimen for the initial treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, several drug-related adverse reactions can result in discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There can also be considerable morbidity, even mortality, particularly with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These events incur substantial additional costs because of the increased frequency of outpatient visits, laboratory tests, and hospitalization in more serious instances. Alternative agents can have greater problems with toxicity and are often less effective, and treatment could be prolonged despite attendant challenges to ensure compliance. As a result, the risk of treatment failure and relapse would become even higher. Therefore, individualized drug management using four standard drugs to minimize the incidence of adverse drug reactions is an unmet need in the present clinical circumstances.</p><p>Isoniazid (INH), a key drug of the currently recommended regimen for patients with tuberculosis, is metabolized by genetically polymorphic <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The rate of elimination of INH is trimodally distributed in accordance with NAT2 metabolic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; NAT2 activity status is genetically controlled and basically depends on the number of active alleles (<italic>NAT2*4</italic> and <italic>*12</italic>). Previous findings indicate that a genetic polymorphism is associated with large interindividual differences in the toxicity and efficacy of INH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Slow acetylators, patients without any active alleles, develop hepatotoxicity more often than rapid acetylators, patients with two active alleles, during treatment for tuberculosis with the standard regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, rapid acetylators are prone to treatment failure with the standard regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], probably due to insufficient exposure to INH. These observations imply that current dosage of INH recommended internationally is too much for slow acetylators and insufficient for rapid acetylators. Thus, we should assume that pharmacogenetically stratified treatment has the potential to avoid unfavorable outcomes with improvements in the cure rate.</p><p>Before the start of a prospective clinical trial with the <italic>NAT2</italic> genotype-guided regimen, dose-finding pharmacokinetic studies were independently carried out in Europe and Japan to expect appropriate clinical dosages of INH for each <italic>NAT2</italic> genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Based on pharmacokinetic parameters estimated from these dose-finding studies, a genotype-based dosage for the present study was determined as follows; half the standard INH dose for slow acetylators, 1.5 times the standard dose for rapid acetylators, and the standard dose for intermediate acetylators.</p><p>Here, we report outcomes of a randomized controlled trial for pharmacogenetics-based tuberculosis therapy (RT-PGTT) conducted in Japan (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 00298870). The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether stratified medicine based on the <italic>NAT2</italic> gene polymorphism could improve the tolerability and efficacy of multidrug therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis with INH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed as a multicenter, two-treatment, parallel group, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) controlled trial, comparing NAT2 genotype-guided and standard dosing of isoniazid in the intensive phase of the 6-month four-drug standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis.

A blood sample was drawn to determine serum concentrations of ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, creatinine, &#x003b3;-glutamyltranspeptidase, albumin, C-reactive protein, and glucose, a full blood count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Sputum and blood samples were collected from all the patients to analyze the items above at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 during the intensive phase, and then monthly during the continuation phase for 6&#x000a0;months.

In brief, hepatocellular injury was defined as a more than two-fold increase in the upper limit of the normal (ULN) concentration of ALT alone or a serum ALT ratio/ALP ratio greater than 5, where the ALT ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;ALT value/ULN of ALT, and ALP ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;ALP value/ULN of ALP. Cholestatic injury was defined as an increase above two-fold of the upper limit of the normal range of ALP or a serum ALT ratio/ALP ratio less than 2. Mixed injury was defined as a serum ALT ratio/ALP ratio of between 2 and 5. Causality assessments showed a relationship to the INH administration if the total score was more than grade 3, i.e. &#x02018;possible&#x02019;.</p><p>Early treatment failure was defined as a combined surrogate endpoint: (1) a positive sputum culture at the 8th week examination, or (2) no sign of improvement in the chest radiograph at 8&#x000a0;weeks for patients with a negative sputum culture at baseline. Secondary outcome measure was defined by the other adverse events during the 8&#x000a0;weeks of the intensive phase of the anti-tuberculosis therapy.</p><p>All outcomes were determined by the members of a separate central end point adjudication committee who used standard definitions and were unaware of treatment allocation and <italic>NAT2</italic> genotypes.

Six single nucleotide polymorphisms in the <italic>NAT2</italic> gene were analyzed: 190C to T (<italic>NAT2*19</italic>), 191&#x000a0;G to A (<italic>NAT2*14</italic>), 341&#x000a0;T to C (<italic>NAT2*5</italic>), 481C to T, 590&#x000a0;G to A (<italic>NAT2*6</italic>), and 857&#x000a0;G to A (<italic>NAT2*7</italic>). Detections were separately duplicated for quality control of genotyping. In brief, the three mutations 481C to T, 590&#x000a0;G to A and 857&#x000a0;G to A were detected by a PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) method as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

To achieve a power of 0.8 with an alpha of 0.05, we aimed to enroll 22 slow acetylators and 156 evaluable rapid acetylators in the trial. According to our calculations, a maximum sample size of 360 patients would be needed to test this hypothesis, allowing for a 15&#x000a0;% dropout rate, with frequencies of rapid, intermediate and slow acetylators estimated at 0.50, 0.42 and 0.08, respectively. A group sequential analysis would be performed if 16 slow acetylators were assessable. The enrollment would be stopped when <italic>p</italic> values regarding INH-DILI in slow acetylators were less than O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming type stopping boundary determined by Lan-DeMets approach. Then, the trial would be finalized early because of ethical considerations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analyses were based on the intention-to-treat approach, including all assessable randomized patients.

Categorical data were compared using the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>2 test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test as appropriate and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used for multivariate analyses. Continuous variables are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD) or 25&#x000a0;%, 50&#x000a0;% and 75&#x000a0;% percentiles as applicable and were analyzed by ANOVA with posthoc and the Student-<italic>t</italic> test (for parametric variables) and the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (for non-parametric variables). The Lan-DeMets alpha spending function was employed for major outcomes.

The <italic>new</italic> dosing regimen significantly reduced the incidences of INH-DILI and early treatment failure, compared to the conventional standardized regimen. The slow acetylators assigned to the PGx-treatment, who were administered a lower dose of INH than the STD-treatment, developed no INH-related liver injury, but achieved clinical improvements within 8&#x000a0;weeks. On the other hand, the rapid acetylators in the PGx-treatment, receiving a higher dose of INH, achieved a 25&#x000a0;% higher rate of clinical improvement by the 8th week than those in the STD-treatment, with an incidence of INH-related liver injury of less than 5&#x000a0;%. The absolute risk reduction in the combined population of rapid and slow acetylators was 31&#x000a0;% with respect to unfavorable events, i.e., INH-DILI or early treatment failure.</p><p><italic>NAT2</italic> genotypic status has been focused on as a genomic biomarker for individualized medicine to preempt INH-related unfavorable events. In fact, INH-induced hepatotoxicity has been studied enthusiastically worldwide since we reported its association with slow acetylator genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In accordance with previous observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the present randomized clinical trial has confirmed that slow acetylators are prone to INH-DILI by conventional standard treatment with the relative risk of 4.5 (95&#x000a0;% CI, 1.3&#x02013;15.3). Importantly, the present trial has clearly demonstrated that the incidence of INH-DILI was strikingly decreased by the <italic>NAT2</italic>-guided dosing stratification of INH. These results suggest that <italic>NAT2</italic>-guided dosing for slow acetylators would contribute to the preemptive discontinuation of anti-tuberculous drugs, thereby reducing the incidence of treatment failure and/or relapse of tuberculosis.</p><p>It has also been discussed that rapid acetylators are prone to treatment failure during anti-tuberculosis therapy based on INH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Consistent with this, we showed that the risk of treatment failure was higher in genotypic rapid acetylators, treated with the conventional dosage of INH, in the present study. Accumulating evidence has revealed the mechanisms of treatment failure with the four-drug standard regimen. Patients with low INH plasma concentrations have a propensity for treatment failure or early relapse of tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that the cumulative antibacterial effect of INH is associated with the area under the INH concentration versus time curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In combination therapy for tuberculosis, the main population of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is susceptible to INH, while pyrazinamide is effective against slower growing bacilli in acidic milieus, and rifampicin against nonreplicating bacilli. During the first 2 to 5&#x000a0;days of the multidrug therapy, the bactericidal activity is derived mainly from INH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This bactericidal activity ceases due to the emergence of an INH-resistant population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], resulting in treatment failure. In the present study, NAT2 genotype-guided dosing stratification of INH obviously improves therapeutic efficacy against INH-sensitive tuberculosis during the first 8&#x000a0;weeks, although the PGx-treatment could not start until a couple of days after the first dose. This fact strongly indicates that appropriate dose adjustment of INH at the beginning of therapy is important to avoid treatment failure and the relapse of tuberculosis, especially for patients infected with <italic>M. tubeculusosis</italic> sensitive to INH.</p><p>Of note, the success rate for anti-tuberculosis treatment has been lower in Japan than in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although a Japanese authority, JATA, has been propelling WHO-recommended programs, and has changed the standard INH dose from 400&#x02013;450&#x000a0;mg to 300&#x000a0;mg, the treatment&#x02013;success rate has not been improved in Japan. Global Health Observatory Data reported that smear-positive tuberculosis treatment-success rates were 52&#x000a0;% in Japan and 69&#x02013;95&#x000a0;% in Europe in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The lower success rate in the Japanese population might be explained by an interethnic difference in <italic>NAT2</italic> genotype frequencies. The frequency of rapid acetylator genotypes in the Japanese population (approx. 50&#x000a0;%) is much higher than that in Caucasians (approx. 5&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Taken together, the dose of INH used in conventional treatment is insufficient for more than a third of Japanese with <italic>NAT2*4/*4</italic> in achieving a satisfactory treatment-success rate. <italic>NAT2</italic> genotype-guided dosing stratification would improve early treatment success rates against tuberculosis, especially in highly-positive excretion levels of bacilli, if the high dose of INH was applied from the first prescription exclusively to rapid acetylators.</p><p>In conclusion, the present pharmacogenetics clinical trial with a PROBE-design demonstrated that <italic>NAT2</italic> genotype-guided dosing stratification of INH could improve treatment outcomes in patients with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Half of the conventional standard dose for slow acetylators reduced INH-DILI and did not reduce therapeutic efficacy. For rapid acetylators, 1.5 times the conventional standard dose of INH reduced early treatment failures without an increase in the incidence of INH-DILI. We propose here that the pharmacotherapy against tuberculosis with INH should be individually designed by stratification based on <italic>NAT2</italic> genetic information in order to achieve the greatest success outcome for each patient.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Junichi Azuma and Masako Ohno contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic></bold><italic>:</italic> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 00298870</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We express gratitude to all the patients who voluntarily contributed to the trial.
