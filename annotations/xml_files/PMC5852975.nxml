The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and preliminary effects of an online educational program in a cohort of adolescent and young adults with SLE with and without a social media (SM) experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Adolescents and young adults with SLE participated weekly for 8 sessions on a web-based educational program about SLE created specifically for this project. Subjects were randomized to respond to questions at the end of each weekly module in a journal or on a SM forum with other SLE subjects. Patients were surveyed prior to initiating the study, (T0) and 6&#x000a0;weeks after completion of the sessions (T1). Medication adherence for hydroxychloroquine, utilizing the medication possession ratio (MPR), was compared for the 3 months preceding T0 and for the 3&#x000a0;months following T1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Twenty-seven of the 37 subjects (73%) enrolled completed the study, including the two required sets of surveys. Reasons for being lost to follow up included being too busy, forgetting, and/or not seeing email reminders. Medication adherence improved in all subjects (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The percentage of the SM intervention group that was adherent (MPR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;80%) significantly improved from 50% to 92% (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.03), while the control group did not. Secondary outcome measures that improved, only in the SM group, included self-efficacy, sense of agency (SOA), sense of community (SOC), and empowerment. There was a strong correlation between empowerment with SOA and SOC and in turn a strong correlation with SOA and SOC with MPR, providing a possible explanation for why social media participation helped to improve medication adherence. Subjective reporting of medication adherence was not reliably correlated to MPR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This pilot study has demonstrated feasibility for the use of an online educational SLE website, recruitment, and measurement of chosen outcome measures.

Self-management skills are vital to the physical and emotional health of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Self-management can be defined as &#x0201c;the individual&#x02019;s ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, and physical and psychological consequences and life style changes inherent in living with chronic illness&#x0201d;. One of the key components of self-management is medication adherence. Non-adherence with medications in patients with systemic lupus has been noted to be as poor as 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Success in disease control can be significantly impacted by such non-adherence. Poor medication compliance is associated with higher SLE disease activity scores and higher SLE disease activity in turn has been demonstrated to be significantly associated with a decline in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Much attention has been paid to how to improve self-management skills in adults, but less is known about how to target adolescents, an age group with a complex set of emotional and developmental needs.</p><p id="Par19">The World Health Organization has described empowerment as a &#x0201c;prerequisite for health&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;proactive partnership and patient self-care strategy to improve health outcomes and quality of life among the chronically ill&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the context of health care, empowerment refers to encouraging people to participate as equal and active partners in decisions about their disease. Patient empowerment aims to improve self-efficacy, promote lifestyle changes, and help to shift the disease management from health professionals to the individual. Self-efficacy theory refers to a person&#x02019;s belief in his/her capacity to successfully modify his/her health care related behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Web-based interventions can improve empowerment and the effects of these interventions may remain for prolonged periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The theoretical mechanism for improved empowerment using social media stems from the rewards of posting and reading posts. Posting activities build a sense of agency (SOA), while reading others&#x02019; posts build relatedness and a heightened sense of community (SOC). SOA is the feeling that one has a competent, confident, and assertive voice. SOC is the feeling that members 1) have a sense of belonging to a community, 2) matter to each other, and 3) have needs that will be met via a commitment to be with one another. Together, the SOA and SOC are known to influence a person&#x02019;s sense of empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Using the internet as a delivery system for information and support provides many advantages, especially for adolescents. The internet, including online forums, allows people with similar experiences and/or interests to interact. It is not limited by physical distance or schedules and allows adolescents to share information that they otherwise may not feel comfortable sharing in person. Effects of interactive health communication that have been demonstrated include improved disease knowledge, clinical outcomes, self-efficacy, and feelings of being socially supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This study examines the feasibility of recruitment for a trial examining the effect of participation in an online educational website for adolescents and young adults with SLE, with and without social media participation. The study also gathers pilot data to determine changes in secondary outcomes including medication adherence and potential associations of this improvement if present.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Educational website</title><p id="Par21">A publically available website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.facinglupustogether.com">www.facinglupustogether.com</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] was created specifically for the purposes of this study.

In order to have an appropriate age distribution between groups, subjects were first identified to be in a younger (13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years) or older (18&#x02013;23&#x000a0;years) age group. Members of the two age groups were then randomized consecutively either to the control group or the social media (SM) experimental group. All participants completed online Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] surveys prior to starting the study (T0) and also 6&#x000a0;weeks after completing the 8-week study (T1). All outcome measures and subject information, except for the medication possession ratio, were measured via responses on the two electronic surveys at T0 and T1. For any participants who did not complete the assigned surveys, the research nurse reached out to them via email and/or telephone to complete the required information. This research protocol was approved by the Penn State Hershey Medical Center Institutional Review Board and all participants/ legal guardians signed written informed consent/assent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study intervention</title><p id="Par24">The intervention phase was 8 weeks in duration. Participants visited the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://facinglupustogether.com">Facinglupustogether.com</ext-link> website and participated in consecutive weekly online educational modules. At the end of each module there were open-ended questions pertaining to the subject of each module. The control group answered the questions in writing in the provided journals. The journals were then sent back to the research team after completion of the 8-week intervention. The SM group answered the questions on an online social media forum with other SM participants. SM participants were encouraged to provide feedback or questions about the material or personal questions that arose in response to each module. A pediatric rheumatologist monitored the SM site every day throughout the study period. Personal messages between participants were not permitted; instead all discussions were encouraged for the entire SM group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Demographic information</title><p id="Par25">Information pertaining to age, self-reported race, gender, SLE disease duration, and SLE disease activity was recorded. SLE disease activity was measured with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) at T0. The SLAQ is a validated self-assessment of disease activity that can be scored via a patient questionnaire without a physical examination or lab assessment. Scores can range from 0 to 44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par26">The primary outcomes of interest were measures of feasibility including recruitment, compliance, and drop out proportions.</p><p id="Par27">The secondary outcomes of interest included adherence to prescribed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Initially we planned to examine adherence to all medications, but there was much variability in the medications prescribed without enough of any one medication, besides, HCQ, to be able to examine differences between subjects. The majority of the subjects were prescribed HCQ, so we examined adherence to HCQ alone for the primary outcome measure, and in all subjects for the secondary outcome measures. Adherence was measured by 1) medication possession ratio (MPR) and 2) the medication adherence self-report inventory (MASRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. MPR is a widely accepted objective measure of medication adherence in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The MPR is reported as a percentage calculated as: (total prescription days of supply/ (last prescription date &#x02013; the first prescription date)). For example, if a patient only filled a one-month prescription twice during 6&#x000a0;months, so only had 60&#x000a0;days of medications available during the 6&#x000a0;months, the MPR would be 33%. The MPR data was obtained by the research team by phone, with subject&#x02019;s permission, from the patient&#x02019;s pharmacy and was calculated for T0 and T1. In order to capture adequate data to calculate the MPR, refill data was acquired for 3 months prior to the beginning of the study (MPR T0) and for 3 months after T1 (MPR T1). A MPR of &#x02265;0.8 is generally accepted as good compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The MASRI is a 6-item Likert Scale questionnaire which has been validated in patients with SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The MASRI was calculated from REDCap questionnaires at T0 and T1.</p><p id="Par28">Additional secondary outcomes of interest included measures of stress, self-efficacy, quality of life, SOA, SOC, and empowerment. Stress was measured by the Perceived Severity of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Self-efficacy was measured using the Children&#x02019;s Arthritis Self-Efficacy scale (CASE), an 11-item Likert scale measure which has been validated in children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and was modified slightly for SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Quality of life was assessed using the validated Simple Measure of the Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters (SMILEY) index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Sense of agency (SOA) was measured via three Likert scale questions aimed to tap three core concepts of agency: <italic>competence</italic> (&#x0201c;Blogging&#x02026; makes me feel I have control over my own voice&#x0201d;<italic>)</italic>, <italic>assertiveness</italic> (&#x0201c;&#x02026;enables me to assert myself&#x0201d;), and <italic>confidence</italic> (&#x0201c;&#x02026;makes me feel I have a distinct voice&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Sense of community (SOC) was measured using a 22-item scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. SOC consists of feelings of belonging to the community, having influence on, and being influenced by, the community, being supported by the community while also supporting them; and feelings of shared emotional connection. Empowerment was assessed using a validated quantitative Likert scale tool that measured 1) &#x0201c;empowering outcomes&#x0201d; (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

In the disease management of children, family empowerment has been shown to improve objective measures of disease control, such as pulmonary function tests in patients with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Parents were allowed to see the online educational modules in our study, but were encouraged not to participate in their children&#x02019;s experience so we could be sure outcomes were based solely on the part of the subject. Future studies could include both child and parent involvement.</p><p id="Par43">Assessments of medication adherence and self-management skills are certainly easier using self-reported measures. In our cohort, the self-reported adherence of the group was correlated only moderately with objective adherence measurement (the MPR). The percent of subjects with a self-report of being adherent (&#x02265; 80%) at T0 was 77% for the entire group as compared to the objective measure of adherence (the MPR) of 54%. Self-reported adherence is not always consistent with, and usually lower than, objective measures of adherence as demonstrated in both adults and children in a variety of medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This information suggests that objective measures of adherence, such as the MPR, should be utilized in children and young adults with SLE, instead of self-reported compliance.</p><p id="Par44">Limitations of this study include the small sample size as well as that we measured medication adherence only to HCQ. Our initial goal was to examine adherence to all medications, but given the low total number of participants, it was not possible to compare adherence rates of different medications among the participants. Medication adherence has previously been shown to differ between drugs taken by adult SLE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We plan to examine adherence rates to all SLE specific medications, including corticosteroids in our larger future study.</p><p id="Par45">Future studies could utilize creative methods to remind participants to complete the study, such as texts and push notifications via cell phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The SMILEY index was developed for children &#x02264; age 18. We did not predict that our mean age would be as high as it was and we will limit recruitment to less than 18&#x000a0;years of age in the larger multi-site trial. Other measures used in the study have not been validated in children, including the SLAQ score. Future studies utilizing a self-reported SLAQ to assess disease activity may be more appropriately completed by the parents of subjects &#x0003c;age 18&#x000a0;years. We also plan to ask participants in the future if there were any significant disease flares during the study period, need for high dose steroids, hospitalizations, etc. that could affect the SLAQ score or other outcome measures.</p><p id="Par46">The use of the MPR to assess medication adherence hinges on the assumption that subjects are taking a medication that they have filled. While this is a limitation, MPR is one of the most widely accepted methods of medication adherence that does not require pill counts or measuring drug levels (38). It is possible that the MPR at T1 may have been increased because patients/ families were more aware of the need to fill them. This potential bias would not explain any intergroup differences between the control and SM groups though.</p><p id="Par47">Overall, the results of this study provide evidence for the feasibility of a large multi-site study examining the effect of a Web-based educational intervention with social media support in adolescents and young adults with SLE. We plan to develop a sustainable model in which these patients can gain self-management skills utilizing online education and peer support from social media. Future studies will focus on empowerment, sense of agency and sense of community as key concepts impacting the effect of these interventions on this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a larger multi-site trial examining the effects of online education and social media support to improve medication adherence in young adults with SLE. All subjects had a significant improvement in medication adherence that was augmented if they also had social media support. Empowerment, sense of agency and sense of community appear to play key roles in the possible mechanisms of this improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
