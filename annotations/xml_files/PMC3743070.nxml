BAY 94-8862 is a highly selective and strongly potent non-steroidal MRA. We investigated its safety and tolerability in patients with HFrEF associated with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>This randomized, controlled, phase II trial consisted of two parts. In part A, the safety and tolerability of oral BAY 94-8862 [2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily (q.d.)] was assessed in 65 patients with HFrEF and mild CKD. In part B, BAY 94-8862 (2.5, 5, or 10 mg q.d., or 5 mg twice daily) was compared with placebo and open-label spironolactone (25 or 50 mg/day) in 392 patients with HFrEF and moderate CKD. BAY 94-8862 was associated with significantly smaller mean increases in serum potassium concentration than spironolactone (0.04&#x02013;0.30 and 0.45 mmol/L, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001&#x02013;0.0107) and lower incidences of hyperkalaemia (5.3 and 12.7%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.048) and WRF. BAY 94-8862 decreased the levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), amino-terminal proBNP, and albuminuria at least as much as spironolactone. Adverse events related to BAY 94-8862 were infrequent and mostly mild.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with HFrEF and moderate CKD, BAY 94-8862 5&#x02013;10 mg/day was at least as effective as spironolactone 25 or 50 mg/day in decreasing biomarkers of haemodynamic stress, but it was associated with lower incidences of hyperkalaemia and WRF.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aldosterone</kwd><kwd>Antagonist</kwd><kwd>Chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>Heart failure</kwd><kwd>Mineralocorticoid receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><related-article id="d35e345" related-article-type="article-reference" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1093/eurheartj/eht235"><bold>See page 2426 for the editorial comment on this article (doi:10.1093/eurheartj/eht235)</bold></related-article></p><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), as well as total mortality, in patients with chronic HF and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C2">2</xref></sup> However, despite their proven benefits in large-scale, prospective, double-blind, randomized trials and recommendations for their use included in international guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C4">4</xref></sup> they remain under-utilized, in large part owing to the risk of hyperkalaemia and renal dysfunction.</p><p>BAY 94-8662 is a next-generation non-steroidal MRA that has shown improved selectivity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) over other steroid hormone receptors compared with spironolactone and improved affinity for the MR compared with eplerenone in pre-clinical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C5">5</xref></sup> In comparative studies using pre-clinical models of hypertension-driven HF and renal dysfunction, BAY 94-8862 has been found to confer more pronounced cardiorenal end-organ protection than the steroidal MRAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C7">7</xref></sup> The minerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study (ARTS) was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of BAY 94-8862 in patients with HFrEF and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to select doses for further study in phase III clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>ARTS was a multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, phase II study, with double-blind placebo and open-label spironolactone comparator arms, conducted in patients with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction, &#x02264;40%) and mild or moderate CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula, 60 to &#x0003c;90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively] at 55 centres in 10 countries worldwide.

The timing of the primary endpoint assessment was based on observations from the PEARL-HF trial, in which serum potassium concentrations increased in the first 7 days after treatment initialization or up-titration of spironolactone and remained nearly stable thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C9">9</xref></sup> The effect of oral BAY 94-8862 on serum potassium concentration was also compared with that of oral open-label spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg q.d. up-titrated to 50 mg q.d. as a secondary objective. Other secondary objectives were the safety and tolerability of BAY 94-8862 and its effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and levels of serum aldosterone, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and amino-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), eGFR, and albuminuria measured at visit 4 (day 15 &#x000b1; 1, i.e. before dose up-titration in the spironolactone group) and visit 7 (day 29 &#x000b1; 2).

BAY 94-8862 at doses of 5 and 10 mg q.d. decreased the levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, and albuminuria to at least the same, if not a greater degree than spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d. Of particular interest is the finding that although these doses of BAY 94-8862 raised serum potassium concentrations as expected, this increase and the incidence of hyperkalaemia associated with these doses were significantly smaller than those recorded for the spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d. group. Furthermore, decreases in eGFR were smaller and the incidence of worsening of renal function was lower in all groups of patients receiving BAY 94-8862 than in those receiving spironolactone.</p><p>Interestingly, the reduction in SBP and the rise in serum aldosterone levels in patients receiving BAY 94-8862 5 and 10 mg q.d. were smaller than observed in patients receiving spironolactone, which could be an additional benefit for patients with HFrEF whose blood pressure is already well controlled by baseline medications (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C11">11</xref></sup> or whose blood pressure is low due to worsening HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C4">4</xref></sup> In other populations, such as those with resistant hypertension, the greater blood pressure-lowering effect of spironolactone would be an advantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C12">12</xref></sup> The SBP, BNP, and NT-proBNP findings of the present study are consistent with the findings of a head-to-head comparison of BAY 94-8862 and eplerenone in a pre-clinical model of hypertension-driven HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C6">6</xref></sup></p><p>The incidence of adverse events related to study drug was low, with the highest proportion of serious adverse events considered to be drug-related occurring in the spironolactone group. Worsening of renal function was reported as an adverse event in 38% of patients treated with spironolactone, whereas the frequencies in the BAY 94-8862 groups were comparable with the event rate in the placebo group. Analysis of pooled data from part B of the study showed that the incidence of hyperkalaemia was significantly higher in the spironolactone group than in the BAY 94-8862 groups. Of interest, the incidences of adverse and serious adverse events even at the highest doses of BAY 94&#x02013;8662, 5 and 10 mg q.d., were less than those observed with spironolactone. The effect of eplerenone was not studied in ARTS, and is difficult to predict because of the general lack of direct comparative data for spironolactone and eplerenone in populations with HF. BAY 94-8862 will be compared with eplerenone in a separate clinical trial (ARTS-HF; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01807221).</p><p>The trend towards a greater reduction in BNP and NT-proBNP levels with BAY 94-8862 5 mg b.i.d. and 10 mg q.d. compared with spironolactone 25 or 50 mg suggests that BAY 94-8862 may exert greater effects on cardiac function and haemodynamic stress at these doses than spironolactone. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that the concentrations of spironolactone and eplerenone in renal tissue are at least six-fold and three-fold higher, respectively, than in the myocardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C13">13</xref></sup> In contrast, BAY 94-8862 distributes equally to the kidney and the heart in rats (unpublished data). This suggests that BAY 94-8862 may have cardiac effects even at relatively low dosages and may in part explain the lower incidence of hyperkalaemia with BAY 94-8862 compared with spironolactone. Furthermore, pre-clinical observations have demonstrated that BAY 94-8862 has more pronounced cardiac and renal anti-remodelling effects than the steroidal MRA eplerenone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C14">14</xref></sup></p><p>The plasma half-life of BAY 94-8862 is &#x0223c;2 h in healthy humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C15">15</xref></sup> compared with &#x0003e;12 h for spironolactone in healthy volunteers (&#x0003e;24 h in patients with HF) owing to the generation of active metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C13">13</xref></sup> Although the half-life of BAY 94-8862 is relatively short, there does not seem to be any advantage in twice-daily administration in the present study. The relatively long duration of action of BAY 94-8862 despite its relatively short plasma half-life is similar to that of eplerenone, which has a plasma half-life of 4&#x02013;6 h in patients with HF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C13">13</xref></sup> but is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for HF at doses of 25 or 50 mg q.d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C17">17</xref></sup> The duration of the effect of an MRA may depend on the biological half-life of the MR in producing its downstream effects in different tissues, such as sodium retention in the kidney or stimulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression, rather than the plasma elimination half-life of the MRA itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT187C13">13</xref></sup> Moreover, the effects of an MRA on pharmacological downstream targets in the kidney, such as the epithelial sodium channel (for sodium excretion) and the renal outer medullary potassium channel (for potassium retention), may take place over longer time frames.</p><p>As a consequence of receptor blockade by an antagonist, the serum concentrations of the receptor ligand are expected to rise. The magnitude of this rise is usually associated with the degree of receptor blockade. In ARTS, serum concentrations of the MR ligand aldosterone increased as expected in all BAY 94-8862 groups, and to a greater extent in the spironolactone group. Levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, and albuminuria were reduced by BAY 94-8862 5 and 10 mg q.d. to at least the same degree as spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d., despite the lower compensatory rises in aldosterone induced by BAY 94-8862. The finding that spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d. resulted in a greater increase in serum aldosterone levels than any dose of BAY 94-8862 may have several reasons (all of which will require further investigation), including: differences in plasma half-life; the effect of the differences in serum potassium concentration on the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland; and differences in the tissue distribution of the non-steroidal MRA BAY 94-8862 and the steroidal MRA spironolactone.</p><p>BAY 94-8862 is highly selective and has a high affinity for the MR, whereas spironolactone also has a high affinity for the MR but is less selective. This accounts for the well-known anti-androgenic and progestonal side effects of spironolactone, which limit patient adherence to therapy. However, the number of patients in this study and the duration of their exposure to BAY 94-8862 are inadequate to provide any definitive information on the relative incidence of these side effects in patients receiving BAY 94-8862.</p><p>Further pre-clinical and clinical studies will be required to gain greater insight into the reasons for the apparent differences in cardiac and renal efficacy of BAY 94-8862 5 and 10 mg q.d. compared with spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d. However, the results of the present study suggest that, in comparison with the steroidal MRA spironolactone 25 or 50 mg q.d., the non-steroidal MRA BAY 94-8862 5 and 10 mg q.d. may be at least as effective in reducing ventricular remodelling (reflected by a decrease in BNP and NT-proBNP levels), despite exerting less effect on SBP, serum potassium levels, and eGFR, as well as being associated with lower incidences of hyperkalaemia and renal adverse events in patients with HFrEF and moderate CKD. The results of the present study provide a strong impetus for further clinical evaluation of BAY 94-8862 in patients with HFrEF and concomitant CKD.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurheartj/eht187/-/DC1">Supplementary material is available at <italic>European Heart Journal</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Bayer Pharma AG.</funding-source> Editorial work (by C.C. of Oxford PharmaGenesis&#x02122; Ltd) was funded by <funding-source>Bayer Pharma AG</funding-source>.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> B.P. has received consulting fees from Amorcyte, Aurasence, Bayer, BG-Medicine, Cytopherx, Gambro, Lilly, Mesoblast, Novartis, Pfizer, scTherapeutics, Sticares InterACT, and Takeda; stock options from Aurasence, BG-Medicine, and scTherapeutics; and travel support from Bayer, Gambro, Mesoblast, and Pfizer.
