Meeting specific physical criteria of 100% relative humidity (RH) and temperature of 37<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C are the basic interventional requirements to administer oxygen for the newborns through a nasal cannula.

Despite the increasing number of cases treated with corticosteroids before birth and the administration of surfactants aiming to reduce RDS, the incidence of BPD in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) newborns showed no significant change during the last decade. Although in the pathogenesis of BPD, genetic inheritance is responsible for the half of the affiliations, other important factors such as chorioamnionitis, hyperoxia, pulmonary edema, nosocomial infection, and respiratory management&#x02013;induced injury are considered major influencing factors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>At the moment, establishing a continuous positive pressure (CPAP) through the airways of an RDS-affiliated newborn together with the administration of surfactant is the cobblestone and the most common intervention for these newborns, especially the ones with extremely low birth weight (ELBW).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nasal cannula, which was first used to administer supplemental oxygen (low-flow therapy) on a large scale, also showed the capability for the administration of CPAP through high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as it developed. Needless to say, apart from meeting specific physical criteria, a relative humidity (RH) of 100% and a temperature of 37<sup>o</sup>C are the basic requirements of this intervention.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The application of HHHFNC in the neonatal intensive care unit has developed significantly during the last decade due to the fact that not only is this system capable of providing a specific percentage of the respiratory oxygen, but it can also administer noninvasive respiratory support of constant-flow CPAP without the need for any further equipment.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>When the respiratory disease is accompanied by increasing respiratory work, supportive mechanisms of HHHFNC are specifically categorized as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Dead space ventilation in the nasopharyngeal space: High-flow therapy (HFT) may eventually enhance alveolar ventilation by decreasing the dead space through establishing washout in the nasopharyngeal space by gas insufflations (GI), which in turn increases the minute ventilation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A decrease in respiratory work: This is the result of providing some level of splinting in the nasopharynx, which has a significant ability of compliance. When HFT produces GIs beyond demand flow in the nasopharynx, it avoids the retraction of the nasopharynx wall in inspiration and with the lowering of resistance in this space, the respiratory work also decreases in inspiration. Moreover, in expiration, the expiratory flows face resistance in the nsaopharynx (due to the jet caused by the nasal cannula), and are redirected to the oropharynx, which eventually decreases the expiratory work because of the occurrence of the Coanda effect in the behavior of the gas.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing the maximum humidity and temperature: To establish optimal gas exchange with the consumption of energy, the airways increase the temperature and RH of the inhaled gases to 37<sup>o</sup>C and 100%, respectively, while the HFT systems block the waste of energy in the airways by establishing these conditions and eventually improving the mechanics of the lungs.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>It should be noted that the similar effects of CPAP on respiratory management are also considered in the description of HFT effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The most vital characteristic of HFT is establishing maximum optimal heating and humidifying for inhaled gases, due to the fact that the ability of the airways, which normally increase the temperature of the gas to 37<sup>o</sup>C and RH to 95-100% in the second and third subsegmental divisions, is dramatically limited and if these criteria are not met, loss of humidity in the airway epithelium, bleeding, inflammation, infection, surfactant degradation, and finally alveolar collapse are inevitable. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a kind of HFT system called Vapotherm 2000i (Vapotherm Inc., Stevensville, MD, USA) which is designed on the basis of semipermeability membranes that are arranged compressively in a kind of cartridge. Sterilized water is pumped into the cartridge while heated, and gas is also pumped with a high pressure into the compressed membranes of the cartridge, and the gas which is extracted from the cartridge enters the airways of the newborn.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was done as a prospective randomized clinical trial on newborns with a weight of 1,000 to 1,500 g as they were recovering from RDS in the neonatal intensive care unit of Beheshti Hospital affiliated to Esfahan Medical University from September 2011 to August 2012.</p><p>Newborns receiving surfactants due to affiliation with RDS and whose oxygen saturation was equal or more than 90% under nasal CPAP (nCPAP) with continuous distending pressure (CDP) = 4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003c;30% during the last four hours and those who still needed oxygen supplement after disconnection from nCPAP were included in the study; the exclusion criteria for this study was if there was a congenital malformation, prenatal asphyxia apgar score of 0 to 3 at min 5, or umbilical cord pH less than 7, and bicarbonate level of the umbilical cord was reported to be less than 12), or nasal mucosa erythema.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The newborns were randomly put in one of the two groups of MR850 or PMH7000 after they were eligible to be disconnected from nCPAP, and HHHFNC respiratory support was administered for them.

Although a few studies have been done on the application of the MR850 system, no study has been found to challenge the PMH7000 humidification system.</p><p>In a study done in 2005 in the neonatal intensive care unit of the McKay-Dee hospital, Woodhead <italic>et al</italic>. included 30 newborns who met the criteria of extubation. The newborns in the first group (n = 15) were treated with Vapotherm 2000i respiratory support for the first 24 hours, whereas the newborns in the second group (n = 15) were treated with nasal cannula (standard high flow/SHF) as respiratory intervention. During the next 24 hours, the respiratory intervention method for the treatment of the newborns was exchanged between the two groups. This study significantly revealed that when the newborns were treated with Vapotherm 2000i system, their respiratory work was reduced, and the nasal mucosa had a more normal condition; however, respiratory rate and incidence of reintubation after the establishment of Vapotherm 2000i system showed a statically insignificant decrease compared to SHF.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In a study done by Waugh <italic>et al</italic>., two systems of HFT, Vapotherm 2000i and Salter Labs, were evaluated based on the humidity level and the temperature of the flow at 5, 10, and 15 L per minute. In the Salter Labs system, the humidifying mechanism is designed based on bubble humidification and active humidification is not applied. The capabilities of the two systems were tested with a digital thermo hygrometer (Mannix, Lynbrook, New York), and the results showed that at a flow of 5 L per minute, the RH for Vapotherm 2000i was 99.9% and the same criterion for the Salter Labs system was estimated to be 78.7%, whereas the temperature for the Vapotherm 2000i system was 36.5 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x000b0;C and the same for the Salter Labs system was estimated 23 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C. For higher flows, the capabilities of the Salter Labs system decreased dramatically, whereas the Vapotherm 2000i system maintained the temperature of 37.1 &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C and RH of 99.9% even at a flow of 40 L per minute.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This study revealed that the capabilities of the MR850 and PMH7000 systems in humidifying and heating the inhalation gas were more than the those of the Salter Labs system; however, these systems did not turn out to exceed the high capabilities of the Vapotherm 2000i system.</p><p>In another study by Walsh <italic>et al</italic>., RH was evaluated with a digital thermo hygrometer (Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) in both humidifier systems, that is, Vapotherm 2000i and MR850 (produced by Fisher &#x00026; Paykel) for the flows of 1 to 8 L per minute, whereas temperature and humidity environment were 22&#x000b0;C and 12%, respectively. The MR850 humidification system is designed based on active humidification. In this study, RH was estimated as an average of 95.75% for MR850 and 98.75% for Vapotherm 2000i which showed a statistically significant difference by the <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.015). In a parallel study done by the same group at flows of 15 to 35 L per minute, Aquanox (Smiths Medical, Kent, UK) and Vapotherm 2000i humidification systems were compared and the resulting RH was 98.5 and 98%, respectively, which showed no statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.667).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>According to technical characteristics, it was noted that the average temperature in the MR850 system was equal to 38.54 &#x000b1; 1.13&#x000b0;C, whereas the average temperature in the PMH7000 system was estimated to be 36.53 &#x000b1; 1.93&#x000b0;C. This difference was not only statistically significant, but it also justified the significant and noticeable difference in the average RH in both systems (RH was equal to 91.59 &#x000b1; 8.77% in the MR850 system compared to 99.74 &#x000b1; 0.66% in the PMH7000 system).</p><p>Although the need to administer invasive mechanical ventilation, nCPAP, and incidence of CLD decreased in the PMH7000 system, the difference was not statistically significant. The nasal trauma showed to be reduced in the PMH7000 group as well, but the difference was not significant. Now the question is whether we can achieve HFT with a nasal cannula in lower temperatures in which RH of 100% is more easily achieved.</p><p>There seems to be a need for more comprehensive clinical trials to answer the question raised in this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict
