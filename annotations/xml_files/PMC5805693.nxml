A simplified meal bolus approach with a dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) closed-loop system (DH-CLS) has been tested; yet, the impact of categorization errors with this strategy is unknown. The objective was to compare, in a randomized controlled inpatient trial, DH-CLS with the simplified meal bolus approach for two different meals properly categorized or overestimated. We tested, in patients with T1D, the simplified strategy with two standardized breakfasts (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10 per meal) adequately categorized or overestimated: (1) 75&#x02009;g and (2) 45&#x02009;g of carbohydrate. No difference was observed for percentage of time &#x0003c;4.0&#x02009;mmol/L over a 4-hour post-meal period (primary outcome; median [IQR]: 0[0&#x02013;0] vs. 0[0&#x02013;0] for both comparisons, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.47 and 0.31 for the 75&#x02009;g and 45&#x02009;g meals, respectively). Despite higher meal insulin boluses with overestimation for both meals (9.2 [8.2&#x02013;9.6] vs. 8.1 [7.3&#x02013;9.1] U and 8.4 [7.2&#x02013;10.4] vs. 4.8 [3.7&#x02013;5.6] U; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), mean glycemia, percentage of time in target range and glucagon infusion did not differ.

These results suggest that the DH-CLS with a simplified meal bolus calculation is probably able to avoid hypoglycemia in the event of meal size misclassification.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The closed-loop delivery systems for glucose control in type 1 diabetes could ease some burden associated with treatment for type 1 diabetes patients. Compared to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, these systems are improving glucose control and reducing the risk of&#x000a0;hypoglycemia significantly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Yet, even in the context of closed-loop delivery, postprandial glucose control remains a challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. With intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes, patients need to estimate the carbohydrate content of their meals and determine the proper insulin bolus based on their insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In a closed-loop strategy, the subcutaneous infusion rate is modulated based on recommendations generated by an algorithm and relying on continuous glucose monitoring sensor readings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. With this strategy, several attempts have been made to alleviate entirely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or simplify meal insulin boluses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We have developed a simplified meal bolus strategy for the closed-loop delivery system based on a semi-quantitative assessment of the meal carbohydrate content. In this strategy, patients choose a meal category between three options (regular, large or very large corresponding respectively to 30&#x02013;60&#x02009;g, 60&#x02013;90&#x02009;g and &#x0003e;90&#x02009;g of carbohydrate) and receive a meal bolus based on a fixed carbohydrate factor for each category (35&#x02009;g, 65&#x02009;g and 95&#x02009;g, respectively), multiplied by their individual insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In previous studies, this strategy yielded similar mean glucose and time spent in target range compared to the carbohydrate-matched boluses; yet, adjustments remained needed to mitigate the risk of&#x000a0;hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This strategy thus has the potential to reduce the burden associated with precise carbohydrate counting, which is challenging for patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, without degrading glucose control. However, errors in carbohydrate counting are frequent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and with this simplified semi-quantitative strategy, misclassification of the meal could result in a large overestimation or underestimation of the meal bolus. It is thus important to establish the potential safety of this simplified meal bolus approach in the context of meal misclassification.</p><p id="Par3">The main objective of the present study is to examine the impact of overestimating a meal insulin bolus (erroneous categorization) in the context of dual-hormone closed-loop delivery with a simplified meal bolus strategy in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. Dual-hormone closed-loop delivery was chosen to limit the potential hypoglycemia risk associated with overestimation of meal insulin&#x000a0;boluses. This study is a single-blind, randomized, two-way, cross-over study to compare 1) Dual-hormone closed-loop delivery with a simplified meal insulin bolus strategy and an adequately estimated (proper categorization) meal size bolus, 2) Dual-hormone closed-loop delivery with a simplified meal insulin bolus strategy and with an overestimated (erroneous categorization) meal size bolus. Two meal scenarios were tested in clinical settings during two consecutive clinical trials: 1) a 75&#x02009;g of carbohydrate meal either adequately estimated (bolus for 65&#x02009;g of carbohydrate) or overestimated (bolus for 95&#x02009;g of carbohydrate) and 2) a 45&#x02009;g of carbohydrate meal either adequately estimated (bolus for 35&#x02009;g of carbohydrate) or overestimated (bolus for 65&#x02009;g of carbohydrate). We hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop delivery with overestimated meal size insulin bolus will not increase time below 4.0&#x02009;mmol/L compared to dual-hormone closed-loop delivery with an adequately estimated meal size insulin bolus. Furthermore, to provide additional insight into the clinical outcomes related to the simplified meal bolus strategy, we simulated <italic>in silico</italic> similar scenarios along with a 105&#x02009;g of carbohydrate meal with an underestimated, adequately estimated, and overestimated insulin bolus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Among the twenty-one participants included and randomized in this study for the clinical trials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), twenty (ten per meal) completed both interventions and were included in the analysis.

The results of the clinical trials indicate that despite increasing meal insulin boluses, overestimation of the meal category did not result in increased time spent in hypoglycemia. However, a few late postprandial hypoglycemic episodes requiring treatment were observed with meal bolus overestimation. Virtual studies yielded the same conclusions and offered the possibility to explore consequences of meal underestimation. This study suggests that dual-hormone closed-loop delivery&#x000a0;combined with a simplified meal bolus strategy using three meal categories can safely handle, in most cases, overestimation or underestimation of meal size leading respectively to larger or smaller insulin boluses.</p><p id="Par11">To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the impact of meal size classification errors in the context of dual-hormone closed-loop delivery. Chase <italic>et al</italic>. have previously shown that whether the bolus was omitted, administered with the meal, before the meal, or overestimated (by 30%), the safety of the single-hormone closed-loop delivery was preserved, and postprandial hyperglycemia was reduced in the context of overestimated bolus with the closed-loop delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A study conducted in children and adolescents also found that single-hormone closed-loop delivery could compensate for an underestimated meal bolus (75% of the dose needed to cover the carbohydrate content of the meal) and improve mean blood glucose compared to usual care, without increasing hypoglycemia risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In the present study, a reduced postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing time below 4.0&#x02009;mmol/L in the case of meal bolus overestimation was&#x000a0;observed.</p><p id="Par12">Simplifying meal bolus calculation could possibly improve quality of life for patients with type 1 diabetes by lessening the burden related to the need of precise carbohydrate counting; yet, it is important not to degrade post-meal glucose control in the process. It is also crucial not to increase the risk of hypoglycemia, an important burden for patients with type 1 diabetes, which impedes glycemic control and impairs quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Considering real-life carbohydrate counting errors are around 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, it is to be expected that mismatches might occur between the meal category selected by patients and the category associated with the exact meal carbohydrate content. With the simplified meal bolus strategy, such a mismatch would result in a larger discrepancy in meal bolus due to the 30&#x02009;g of carbohydrate increment between each category. Examining the impact of such errors on the risk of hypoglycemia was thus important to ensure potential safety of this approach. The algorithm used in the present study has a security limit implemented which prevents a meal bolus to be larger than 21% of the participant&#x02019;s average total daily insulin dose. This limit may have played a role in the prevention of hypoglycemia, especially for large meals where the limit can be reached more rapidly. The same 21% limit for the insulin bolus was also implemented in the virtual trials. In the 75&#x02009;g of carbohydrate meal in the present study, the bolus limit was reached in seven out of ten patients, with the bolus being identical for overestimation and adequate estimation in three patients. The mean boluses remained significantly different even though the magnitude of the difference was attenuated. This limit did not impact the bolus difference in the smaller meals with 45&#x02009;g of carbohydrate. Reduced meal boluses compared to estimated boluses strictly based on carbohydrate content of the meals and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios has been used previously in the context of DH-CLS glucose control and has led to decreased time in hypoglycemia and comparable mean sensor glucose for DH-CLS delivery compared to conventional therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Despite the insulin bolus differences for both studies&#x000a0;(75 g and 45 g of carbohydrate meals), mean sensor glucose and time in target range did not differ during the 4-h postprandial period when the meal was properly categorized or overestimated.

This could possibly be explained, in part, by the elevated starting&#x000a0;(pre-meal) glucose (between 7.3 and 9.0&#x02009;mmol/L) which can be typically observed in the morning combined with the lower insulin sensitivity at the breakfast meal which makes it a more difficult meal to control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">This study was conducted using dual-hormone closed-loop delivery to limit the hypoglycemia risk associated with overestimation. The glucagon delivery in the clinical trials was similar between adequately or overestimated meals, for both the large and the regular meals. Its infusion in the late postprandial period for both meals may, however, have played a role in the hypoglycemia prevention. Several studies are suggesting an added benefit of glucagon incorporation in closed-loop delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>; yet subgroups of patients or some situations may benefit more from its addition. The use of a simplified meal bolus strategy is possibly best accompanied with glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia risk, especially during the late postprandial phase, but investigating this strategy in the context of single-hormone closed-loop delivery would be of interest.</p><p id="Par15">With actual available technologies, fully automated closed-loop delivery with no meal bolus or announcement has been consistently associated with significant postprandial hyperglycemic excursions and late postprandial hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. On the other hand, with a hybrid closed-loop delivery with a carbohydrate-matched insulin bolus, postprandial glucose control remains suboptimal, mostly due to post-meal hyperglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, the need for precise carbohydrate counting is a limitation of hybrid closed-loop delivery from the perspective of relieving the patients from daily tasks. A simplified meal bolus strategy has potential benefits: 1) evaluating the meal size in terms of carbohydrate categorization is simpler than the current carbohydrate counting strategy and 2) simplified partial bolus can still be individualized for each patient and for each meal or time period. This strategy has been shown to be promising in outpatient settings despite the need for adjustments to limit hypoglycemia risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A similar strategy is also used with dual-hormone closed-loop system by Russell <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In their strategy, patients select a meal type (breakfast, lunch or dinner) and size (typical, more than usual, less than typical or a small bite), and a meal-priming bolus is administered. The merits of their strategy for glucose control have been demonstrated in two large automated outpatient trials in children and adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Again, the safety of such strategies in the context of misclassification is essential to improve glucose control adequately.</p><p id="Par16">We acknowledge some limitations in this study. First, it was conducted on a single&#x000a0;meal, at breakfast. Breakfast is typically more difficult to control and results would need to be validated in outpatient studies with various meals and conditions e.g. optimal pre-meal glucose value, different time of the day or macronutrient content, etc. Also, the C-Peptide response was not measured in the present study. Although some cases on residual C-Peptide response have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, decline in endogenous insulin secretion is seen with increasing disease duration and the clinical impact of these detectable, but very low, C-Peptide values remain questionable. We are also unable to evaluate whether our conclusions can be generalized to other artificial pancreas systems, especially the single-hormone closed-loop delivery systems, as well as algorithms that are not integrating a maximum meal bolus dose. Yet, these results provide helpful insights on the potential of the dual-hormone closed-loop delivery to safely handle inadequately estimated meal boluses. It is unlikely, but it&#x000a0;remains possible, that more hypoglycemic episodes would occur in the case of meal carbohydrate content size overestimation with larger sample size. A strength of this study is the complementary <italic>in silico</italic> testing which confirmed our findings from the clinical trials and provided the opportunity to test additional scenarios.

Participants were instructed how to install and use the continuous glucose monitoring systems (Dexcom G4 Platinum, Dexcom) or they could also set an appointment with study personnel for installation. They were instructed to calibrate sensors at least twice, and maximum four times daily using capillary blood glucose values.</p><p id="Par21">Interventions were undertaken one to five days after sensor insertion. Subjects were admitted at IRCM at 7:00&#x02009;am and were asked to fast from the previous night (midnight). If a correction bolus or a hypoglycemia correction (food or carbohydrate intake) was performed by patients within the four hours preceding the test, the test was reported or delayed depending on the magnitude of treatment or correction. Upon arrival, patients&#x02019; pumps were substituted with the study pump and a second pump containing glucagon was installed. During the interventions, variable subcutaneous insulin (patient&#x02019;s usual insulin: Lispro, Aspart or Glulisine) and glucagon (Eli Lilly) infusion rates were used to regulate postprandial glucose levels using two infusion pumps (Accu-Check Combo, Roche). Glucagon was reconstituted according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Capillary blood glucose was measured to calibrate the sensor.

Subjects were offered a choice between two menus (Appendix A), but consumed the same meal on both interventions. During the intervention, patients were allowed to do sedentary activities only (reading, watching television, playing video games, etc.). They were also allowed coffee or tea, but their consumption had to be replicated during the second intervention. The intervention ended at 1:00&#x02009;pm.

The simplified bolus strategy is based on the estimated meal size (regular, large or very large) and the closed-loop delivery system gives the remaining insulin needed based on the sensor readings. Prandial boluses are calculated as individualized insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios multiplied by a fixed carbohydrate factor depending on the category. A regular meal is defined as 30 to 60&#x02009;g of carbohydrate, with a bolus for 35&#x02009;g. A large meal is defined as 60 to 90&#x02009;g of carbohydrate, with a bolus for 65&#x02009;g. A very large meal is defined as more than 90&#x02009;g, with a bolus for 95&#x02009;g. Patients thus have to select a category for their meal rather than count the exact amount of carbohydrates. For the purpose of this study, the meal category was entered by study personnel based on the randomized sequence (adequate estimation or overestimation): for the 75&#x02009;g of carbohydrate meal, a bolus for 65&#x02009;g (adequate estimation: large meal) or 95&#x02009;g (overestimation: very large meal) was provided and for the 45&#x02009;g of carbohydrate meal, a bolus for 35&#x02009;g (adequate estimation: regular meal) or 65&#x02009;g (overestimation: large meal) was provided.

Secondary endpoints were also calculated for the 4-hour period following the meal and included; mean sensor glucose, percentage of time for which sensor glucose was in the target range (4.00&#x02013;10.00&#x02009;mmol/L), percentage of time spent above the target range, peak and time to peak sensor glucose, insulin bolus, total amount of insulin delivered, and the total amount of glucagon delivered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par25">The effect of the interventions on the continuous outcomes was estimated using a multivariate linear mixed effect model (LMEM) with the intervention (2 levels), treatment sequence, period, and starting glucose level entered as fixed effects, and subject nested within sequence as random effect.
