It must be underlined that in patients studied here, metabolic acidosis was corrected by bicarbonate supplementation. One could speculate that the marked decrease in muscle protein degradation observed after the LPD could have been hindered by uncorrected acidosis.</p><p id="p0165">Preservation of muscle protein synthesis is a necessary component of the &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d; to a low protein intake.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In our study, muscle protein synthesis was unaffected by a 0.55-g/kg LPD, showing that changes occurring in muscle at this protein intake are truly adaptive. However, it is unclear which protein intake levels may be safe for skeletal muscle, even in healthy subjects. Hursel <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> observed that a 10% to 12% decrease in whole-body protein synthesis and degradation took place during the adaptation to a low (0.4 g/kg) versus high (2.4 g/kg) protein intake; however, the 0.4-g/kg protein diet did not lower fractional muscle protein synthesis. These data suggest that muscle protein synthesis in some healthy young individuals may be unexpectedly maintained at very low protein intakes. However, if not supplemented, a 0.45-g/kg day is not sufficient to maintain protein synthesis and muscle mass in elderly subjects,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> who now constitute a large majority of patients with CKD in many countries.</p><p id="p0170">As a next step, we studied how muscle protein metabolism adapts to a 0.45-g/kg per day protein, supplemented with 0.1 g/kg EAA and KA, as compared with a 0.55-g/kg LPD. In keeping with previous studies,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> we observed that the sVLPD was not associated with changes in body weight and composition; however, in terms of muscle protein kinetics, this diet was associated with a lower net muscle catabolism, as compared with the LPD.</p><p id="p0175">The already low muscle protein degradation rates attained during an LPD were not further reduced by the sVLPD, suggesting that adaptation to a more restricted protein intake cannot be attained by further restraining protein degradation. In our study, the decrease in net protein catabolism by the sVLPD was likely an effect of increased efficiency of protein turnover and preservation of muscle protein synthesis, as compared with the LPD. These effects are in keeping with studies showing that higher protein quality intake better stimulates muscle protein anabolism and protein synthesis.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Leucine, in particular, has been identified as the key factor stimulating the post-prandial rise in muscle protein synthesis.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Recently, autophagy and apoptosis have been shown to be reduced when an LPD was supplemented with leucine and KA, as compared with an LPD, in rodents with CKD.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the persistent suppression of protein degradation and the decrease in net protein balance under the sVLPD was, at least in part, a carryover effect of previous LPD treatment. In this regard, a significant carryover effect of exposure to an LPD before the treatment period appears unlikely, because protein metabolism fluctuates largely during the day in response to nutrient ingestion and the effects of dietary protein on protein turnover are very fast and reversible.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> In addition, the effects of the sVLPD on net protein balance were reversed during the washout LPD period.</p><p id="p0180">It is commonly retained that whole-body measurements of protein turnover are not a sensitive metabolic indicator of adequacy of protein intake.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> In our study, although muscle protein metabolism showed to be extremely sensitive to the level of protein intake, extramuscle tissue seemed to be scarcely affected. Because splanchnic organs account for as much as 40% to 50% of whole-body protein degradation, one could assume that protein turnover in these tissues is less sensitive to protein intake than in skeletal muscle. This is also reflected by the finding that liver albumin synthesis is scarcely influenced by protein intakes varying from 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg, if calorie intake is adequate.<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p><p id="p0185">A possible limitation of our study is that patients studied here were selected for good compliance to protein-restricted diets. Therefore, the results of our study cannot be extended to patients who are not adherent to dietary treatment. Wasting may develop if not all aspects of the protein-restricted diet are properly implemented or followed or when dietary intake is involuntarily reduced during intercurrent illnesses. In addition, we studied the response to reduced protein intake only in the basal, postabsorptive state. Previous studies have shown that neutral body N balance on an sVLPD can be attained by reduction of whole-body leucine oxidation and postprandial inhibition of protein degradation.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, our study is the first to address the issue of the adaptation of muscle protein turnover to LPDs. Further studies are needed to explore the response of muscle protein turnover to feeding different diets in patients with CKD. A recent observation in older, otherwise healthy subjects shows that the habituation to an LPD (0.7 g/kg) compared with a high protein diet (1.5 g/kg) augments the postprandial availability of dietary protein-derived AAs in the circulation and does not lower basal muscle protein synthesis rates after ingestion of protein.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> However, no information is available for patients with CKD.</p><p id="p0190">Another possible limitation of this study is that both methods we used to measure muscle mass, anthropometry and bioimpedance, are influenced by the hydration status. Therefore, it is still possible that during the study subtle changes in muscle mass may have occurred and passed unnoticed.</p><p id="p0195">In conclusion, we used phenylalanine turnover methodology to examine how uncomplicated, moderately severe CKD affects the ability of patients to adapt to dietary protein restriction in skeletal muscle. Our study demonstrates that both LPD and sVLPD significantly affect forearm protein metabolism. Overall, the results of this study indicate skeletal muscle protein metabolism adaptation to restrained protein intake can be obtained via combined responses of reduced protein degradation and increased efficiency of AA recycling.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0200">All the authors declared no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1a"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Piccirillo</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Demontis</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanisms of muscle growth and atrophy in mammals and</article-title><source>Drosophila.
