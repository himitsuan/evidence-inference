Successful interventions depend on adherence to treatment, lifestyle change and on the maintenance of the therapeutic support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several authors highlighted the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the management of obesity in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Internet-based weight management programs have the potential for being an effective option since they allow ongoing contact between the adolescent and the health care provider, which has been associated to a greater adherence to behavioural changes and to an improvement of maintenance of weight lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Literature has shown that internet-based weight management programs are effective in body mass index (BMI) reduction, physical activity increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], increased adherence to behavioural change and maintenance of weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A previous non randomized study with the Next.Step program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], an e-therapeutic program which aims to promote weight management skills and the adoption of health-promoting lifestyles in overweight adolescents, showed an increase in health responsibility. However, it was mentioned by then that there was need for additional studies in order to understand whether the internet (in general) and the Next.Step (in particular) could be considered as effective communication channels for inducing behavioural change in overweight adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the current study analyzed the effectiveness of the Next.Step program compared to a standard intervention, in what concerns a set of anthropometric and psychosocial variables. We considered the anthropometric variables (BMI and percentage of fat mass) and quality of life as primary endpoints. Data on health responsibility, positive perspective of life, self-efficacy/adherence to behaviour change and perception of benefits from the intervention (secondary endpoints) were used to evaluate additional effects of the intervention. We hypothesized that the Next.Step program would be more effective on the promotion of weight management than the standard intervention, expecting that anthropometric and psychosocial variables would be positively influenced by the program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The sample comprised 80 adolescents (40/40: experimental/control groups), aged between 12 and 18 (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.6; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.88), 52.9&#x000a0;% females.</p><p>Sample size was calculated according to the power analysis, with BMI, quality of life, treatment adherence and lifestyle used as starting points.

Height was measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm, without shoes, with the participant back to the stadiometer, in the Frankfurt position and after an expiratory phase (height stadiometer, SECA 217, Hamburg, Germany). Body weight and body composition (bioelectrical impedance scale InBody 230, Seoul, Korea). Body weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg, in the anthropometric position (with the palms turned into thighs), with the subjects wearing as few clothes as possible, and without shoes or socks. BMI was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters [BMI&#x02009;=&#x02009;weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m)]. Subjects were classified into overweight (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;85<sup>th</sup> percentile) according to the age- and sex-specific percentiles proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Self-efficacy/adherence behavior and perceived benefits</title><p>Adolescents reported on their self-efficacy/adherence behavior to weight control using the Adherence to Weight Control Questionnaire (AWCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The AWCQ is a screening tool that includes 36 items, rated on a 1&#x02013;5 Likert scale (&#x0201c;Do not agree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Totally agree&#x0201d;), organized in two scales: Treatment adherence to weight control and Risk of non-adherence to weight control. The former scale includes four subscales: Self-efficacy/adherence behavior (SEA); Parents and providers&#x02019; influence; School and Friends&#x02019; influence; and Perceived benefits (PB). In this study, we have only used the SEA and the PB dimensions as we were mostly interested in internal/individual sources of behavioral influence. The SEA dimension includes 12 items such as &#x02018;<italic>I accomplish the treatment even if I&#x02019;m not in the mood</italic>&#x02019;. This dimension represents the perception of self-ability and commitment to organize and perform a particular health behavior, i.e., self-confidence in successfully engaging in the weight management program, intention to carry out the treatment and ability to identify the specific strategies to succeed. The PB dimension includes four items (e.g., &#x02018;<italic>I want to lose weight to be healthier</italic>&#x02019;) related to perceptions of the positive or reinforcing consequences of engaging in the weight management program.</p><p>In the previous validation study with a sample of Portuguese adolescents with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the SEA and PB dimensions have shown good internal consistency (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.89 and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.77, respectively), similar to the ones found in the current study (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.84; <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.75, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Quality of life (QoL)</title><p>Adolescents completed the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which assesses obesity-specific quality of life. The IWQOL-Lite is a 31-item questionnaire scored on five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). This instrument assesses four dimensions: Body self-esteem; Social life; Physical comfort; and Relation with the family. Engel and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found a good value of internal consistency for the total score.

The ALP-R2 includes 36 items rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). This instrument assesses seven dimensions: Health responsibility (HR), Physical activity, Nutrition, Interpersonal relationships, Spiritual health, Positive life perspective (PLP), and Stress management. In this study, we have only focused on the PLP and HR dimensions. PLP dimension includes four items (e.g., &#x02018;<italic>I&#x02019;m excited about the future</italic>&#x02019;) and HR dimension includes six items (e.g., &#x02018;<italic>I usually ask questions about how to improve my health to my doctor/nurse&#x02019;</italic>). We opted to focus only on these two dimensions because we were essentially interested in internal/individual sources of behavioral change.</p><p>Sousa et al.

All eligible adolescents with appointments between 2014 April 1 and 2015 January 31 were included in the study. Adolescents were assigned to the control or experimental groups by alternating patients sequentially. Participants were required to be overweight, aged between 12 and 18, willing to participate in the study and have internet access at least once a week. Exclusion criteria were the presence of severe psychopathology, pregnancy or having been proposed for bariatric surgery. The control group followed the clinical standard intervention, including individual appointments with the paediatrician, dietician and exercise physiologist every 3&#x000a0;months. In addition to the standard intervention, the experimental group was invited to access the e-therapeutic platform, which includes a set of resources, such as educational resources (videos, brochures, menus, weekly tips, access to other links), self-monitoring (food, weight and physical activity records), social support (chats, discussion forums and personalized messages), interactive training and motivational tools (personal goals planning, treatment progression registry, positive reinforcement) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The intervention length was 12&#x000a0;weeks and was based on a case management methodology. So, the program had the direct support of an interdisciplinary team (including paediatrician, nutritionist, exercise physiologist, and psychologist) who intervened when requested by the case manager (nurse). Full presentation of the platform features can be found in detail in the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon.

The results showed that, at 0&#x000a0;months, the control group mean score (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.20; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10) was higher than the experimental group mean score (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.93; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09); and, at 3&#x000a0;months, the control group mean score (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.08; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.07) was lower than the experimental group mean score (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.18; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.09).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mean scores of &#x02018;positive perspective of life&#x02019; for experimental and control groups across time (baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40608_2016_94_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we analyzed the initial effectiveness of an e-therapeutic program (Next.Step) when compared to a standard intervention, regarding the BMI, percentage of fat mass and QoL (primary endpoints), and health responsibility, positive perspective of life, self-efficacy and adherence to behaviour change, and perception of benefits from the intervention (secondary endpoints).</p><p>Our results provide little support for the hypothesis that the Next.Step program is more effective than the standard intervention in the promotion of weight management. In fact, the adolescents who joined the Next.Step program did not show any differences regarding the primary endpoints compared to the control group, which supports the results of the preliminary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, in contrast with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], our findings do not suggest that internet-based weight management programs do promote health responsibility, self-efficacy/adherence to behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The lack of significant differences regarding the primary endpoints might be related to the reduced time of intervention. It is also possible that the lack of improvement in the experimental group regarding the identified variables is due to limited exposure to the resources/materials relevant for the intervention, despite the fact that all participants have periodically received both automatic and personalized reminder messages sent through the platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, if a control group without any intervention at all had been used, maybe we would have found more significant differences between the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Despite there was no change in the primary outcomes (body mass index and percentage of fat mass), our findings suggest that the adolescents who joined the Next.Step program showed a significant increase in the indices of positive perspective of life and of perception of benefits of the intervention. Although these variables are secondary outcomes, they have been pointed out as most influential on weight management. For example, a recent qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] identified positivity, i.e., the generation of positive emotions, as a relevant feature of a ICT effective weight management program.</p><p>This study has several limitations that must be underlined: (i) only one self-reported measure was used to assess each psychosocial variable, so it is questionable whether the findings can be generalized to other measures; (ii) bias associated to self-reported questionnaires (e.g., social desirability); (iii) the absence of a follow-up to evaluate the maintenance of the behavioral change; (iv) the absence of data collection regarding the access frequency to the e-platform.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our findings provide little support for the effectiveness of internet-based weight management programs as an add-on to the standard intervention. However, it showed improvement in secondary outcomes that have been identified as relevant for an effective weight management.</p><p>For a better understanding of the power of internet-based weight management programs, these findings should be carefully examined in future studies including a wider set of measures and a long-run follow-up.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>This research involves human participants and an informed consent was signed by all the participants and their parents.
