Although the pathological hallmark of MS is represented by the focal demyelinating lesions, there is compelling evidence suggesting that focal demyelinating lesions are only one part of MS pathology and that diffuse tissue damage also occurs throughout the whole central nervous system.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This is mostly driven by a constant and relentless neurodegeneration leading to the accumulation of brain atrophy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Neuroimaging studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived methods to assess brain volume loss (BVL) in MS as a reliable measure of diffuse tissue damage.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> They have shown that BVL occurs since the earliest stages of MS, accumulates throughout the course of MS, and appears to be correlated with physical disability and cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In addition, some recent studies have shown that BVL can be reduced in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) under specific pharmacological treatments.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Against this background, we performed an exploratory analysis on the CLAdRIbine Tablets treating multiple sclerosis orallY (CLARITY) study.

This is in line with other RMS trials that have also shown significant BV reductions with disease-modifying therapies<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and provides further evidence of the need for treatments that target not only focal inflammation but also the diffuse brain tissue damage and neurodegeneration that occur over the course of MS.</p><p>Since anti-inflammatory drugs used for the treatment of MS have often been associated with a paradoxical acceleration of BVL following the initiation of therapy (i.e. pseudoatrophy),<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> we excluded here PBVC data from the first 6&#x02009;months of the study. Indeed, PBVC data clearly showed a pronounced pseudoatrophy effect after therapy initiation. In line with this, no treatment effect on PBVC was shown in the subgroup of patients who presented with gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline, a finding similar to that reported in MS patients treated with other anti-inflammatory agents.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this context, it must be stressed that the assumption that pseudoatrophy occurs only during the first months of therapy is not necessarily valid, as the time course of pseudoatrophy is not completely understood.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Indeed, there is the possibility that the accelerated BVL associated with the suppression of inflammation can continue even beyond 1&#x02009;year.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This may explain the relatively small treatment effect found in our study, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of cladribine, as reflected by slowing of BVL between months 6 and 24, is still being underestimated and that the 2-year placebo-controlled observation period might not be long enough to fully evaluate this effect.</p><p>In this study, we also assessed PBVC/year rates to be able to compare them to previously reported data.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Both treatment arms of this study (0.56% and 0.57% for 3.5 and 5.25&#x02009;mg/kg, respectively) were comparable to the PBVC/year rate (0.52%) reported in a recent longitudinal analysis of MRI data which used identical methodology (i.e., SIENA) and provided a 95% specificity in discriminating patients with MS from healthy controls and to have a prognostic value for discriminating patients who would develop disability progression in a long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Another important finding of this exploratory analysis is the close correlation between PBVC/year and disability progression, with the highest probability of remaining free from disability progression observed in patients who showed the least brain atrophy and vice versa. These findings also add to what is known about the benefits of cladribine tablets treatment seen in clinical trials: the risk of disability progression was significantly lower in the two groups treated with cladribine tablets compared with placebo.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The results of the present analysis suggest that the benefits of cladribine tablets in RMS patients may include significant reduction in the neurodegeneration associated with MS clinical progression.</p><p>We therefore conclude that cladribine tablets given annually for 2&#x02009;years in short-duration courses in patients with RMS in the CLARITY study significantly reduced brain atrophy in comparison with placebo treatment, with residual rates in treated patients being close to the physiological rates. Furthermore, the brain atrophy reduction was closely associated with a lower risk of disability progression, suggesting that, in addition to the effects on focal demyelination,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1352458517690269" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> treatment with cladribine tablets can target diffuse brain tissue damage and neurodegeneration in patients with RMS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank patients and their families, investigators, coinvestigators, and the study teams at each of the participating centers and at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: N.D.S. has received honoraria from Schering, Biogen Idec, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Novartis, Genzyme Corporation, Roche, and Merck for consulting services, speaking, and travel support.
