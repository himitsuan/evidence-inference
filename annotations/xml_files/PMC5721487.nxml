The prevalent symptoms are nasal congestion and ocular complications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Immunoglobulin E has an essential role in allergic responses so that the initial response was initiated by an IgE-related allergic process.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This process leads to release of mediators of inflammation such as histamine, neutral proteases, chemotactic factor, and acid hydrolases from basophils and mast cells.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] AR has two forms including seasonal and perennial forms. Symptoms of seasonal AR which usually caused by allergic sensitivity to airborne mold spores or pollens from grass, trees, and weeds can occur in spring, summer, and early fall. People with perennial AR experience symptoms year-round. It is generally caused by dust mites, pet hair or dander, cockroaches, or mold. Underlying or hidden food allergies rarely cause perennial nasal symptoms. About 20% of AR cases are seasonal, and 40% are perennial types. Other 40% of patients have a combination of these two types.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Due to the high prevalence of AR, it affects community as impaired quality of life and related diseases such as atopy and asthma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In various studies, it is reported that this disease is developing whole around the world;[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] although AR is not a fatal disease, it often leads to change and loss of quality of patients&#x02019; life. The patients suffer from different problems such as impairment of behavior, learning, and memory. They are susceptible to more serious side effects such as asthma and sinusitis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Annually, the loss of 2 million workdays and 2&#x02013;5 billion dollars in health costs are the most important complications of the disease in America.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There are several available procedures for the treatment of AR. The common treatments include intranasal corticosteroids, oral and topical antihistamines, decongestants, intranasal cromolyn, intranasal anticholinergic, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. These procedures reduce the symptoms of disease temporarily and have low therapeutic effect. On the other hand, long-term use of these agents is associated with side effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] According to this problem and high prevalence of AR as well as tendency to medicinal plants, the development and finding of new herbal drugs for the treatment of this disease are beneficial.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There are many successful experiments in the literature about medicinal plants such as the effects of <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and <italic>Petasites hybridus</italic>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] on AR symptoms in the randomized clinical trial studies. Furthermore, it was investigated that some polyherbal formulations such as Biminne, a Chinese herbal formulation[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Aller-7 a capsule from a standardized extract of seven Indian medicinal plants[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] improved AR symptoms.</p><p>Furthermore traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TM/CAM) are good sources to find new suggestions, in particular, herbal remedies for evaluating in current medicine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The use of TM/CAM in Western medicine has highly increased in recent decades. Many treating methods of TM/CAM, such as herbal remedies, are mainstream or traditional in many parts of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that most of the world's people regularly using TM,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] such as traditional Chinese medicine Regarding these issues, despite advances in conventional therapy, a great number of patients with AR are tending to complementary medicine for relief. The lifetime prevalence of TM/CAM use in patients with AR ranges from 27% to 46%, and many of the patients who have not yet used TM/CAM, intend to do so in the future.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Persian Medicine (PM) or Traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM) is one of such traditional systems of medicine. PM has the sum total of all the knowledge and practices administered in prevention, diagnosis, and elimination in Persia in ancient and medieval times.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There are more than thousands of manuscripts in PM; it can be as treasure for researchers in this field as well as good advantage to develop the scientific and universal medicine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p><italic>Nepeta bracteata</italic> Benth.
