Voluven&#x000ae; and Venofundin&#x000ae; are two new generation HES solutions with different origin and physico-chemical properties.

The coagulation profile of the two starches was compared using thrombelastography (TEG&#x000ae;).</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Aretaieio Hospital Institutional Review Board and was conducted at Aretaieio Hospital, Department of Anesthesiology, Athens, Greece from April 2007 to October 2008. During this period, consecutive patients who were admitted to the surgery ward and underwent preanesthetic evaluation for elective major abdominal surgery were assessed for eligibility to be included in the study. Fifty two patients scheduled for gastrectomy, pancreatic surgery or colorectal surgery gave written informed consent to participate in this prospective randomized double blinded study. Exclusion criteria were physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#x0003e;III, haemoglobin &#x0003c;10 g/dl, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction in the last 6 months, unstable angina, renal or hepatic dysfunction, coagulation disorders or oral anticoagulant medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 24 h preoperatively, acetylsalicylic acid with in 5 days preoperatively, need for intraoperative administration of heparin, diabetes insipidus, chronic intake of corticosteroids, body weight more than 100 kg, pregnancy or lactation and allergy to starch. Low molecular weight heparin as standard prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis was given the evening before the operation (12 or more hours preoperatively). Patients were randomly assigned to the Voluven&#x000ae; (n=26) or the Venofundin&#x000ae; (n=26) group by the use of sealed envelopes describing the group of assignment.</p><p>After positioning on the operating table, standard monitoring was applied to all patients (ECG, heart rate, pulse oximeter, blood pressure measurement (Datex-Ohmeda S/5&#x02122; Anaesthesia Monitor, Helsinki, Finland). The infusion of a Ringer's lactate (RL) solution was started at a rate 10 ml/kg/h, with further adjustments according to patient's needs. All patients received intravenously 10 mg of metoclopramide, 50 mg of ranitidine, 1-2 mg of midazolam and 50-100 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl. After establishing arterial blood pressure measurement via radial artery and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring via the right internal jugular vein, the first blood sample was withdrawn and analyzed in the thombelastograph (TEG&#x000ae; 5000 Thrombelastograph&#x000ae; Hemostasis System, Haemoscope Corporation, Niles). An infusion of Voluven&#x000ae; or Venofundin&#x000ae; was then started at a basic rate of 500 ml/h, which was continuously adjusted so as the CVP to be maintained between 8 and 12 mmHg. The infusion of 30 ml/kg colloid solution was accomplished intraoperatively or shortly postoperatively.</p><p>Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental 4-5 mg/kg. Cis-atracurium 0.15 mg/kg was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Sevoflurane 1-2 per cent end-tidal concentration in a nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture (FiO<sub>2</sub>: 0.4) along with incremental doses of cis-atracurium, fentanyl and morphine were administered to maintain anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocarbia (ETCO<sub>2</sub> between 35-40 mm Hg). A urinary catheter and an oesophageal thermistor were inserted for urine output and core temperature monitoring, respectively. Air warming blankets and fluid warmers were used to prevent hypothermia. When the administration of 30 ml/kg HES was accomplished, a second blood sample was obtained and analyzed in the thrombelastograph. All blood samples were collected from the right internal jugular vein catheter after discarding the dead space.</p><p>Immediately after sampling, 1 ml of native whole blood was added to a kaolin vial (TEG&#x000ae; Hemostasis Analyzer Kaolin, Haemoscpe Corporation, Niles IL, USA) and mixed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Subsequently, 360 &#x003bc;l of the blood/kaolin mixture were pipetted into disposable plastic cups (Disposable Cups and Pins, TEG&#x000ae; Hemostasis Analyzer) placed into the TEG&#x000ae; cupwells. All measurements were performed at 37&#x000b0;C by an investigator blinded to the colloid used. Reaction time (R, normal range 4-8 min), kinetic time (K, normal range 0-4 min ), &#x003b1;-angle (&#x003b1;, normal range 47-74&#x000b0;), maximum amplitude (MA, normal range 54-72 mm) and coagulation index (CI, normal range -3 to +3) were recorded.</p><p>Colloid and crystalloid infusion rates were adjusted in order to maintain normovolemia and haemodynamic stability. In case of reduction of urine output below 0.5 ml/kg/h or systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg despite adequate intravascular volume replacement as guided by CVP, dopamine was added at 3-10 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. In case of severe haemodynamic instability phenylephrine was administered, dose titrated according to needs. The patients were transfused with red blood cells (RBC), if Hb &#x0003c;8 g/dl, with 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for 4 units of RBC or if diffuse oozing appeared in the surgical field, and with platelets (PLT) if their count was below 80000/&#x003bc;l. The duration of colloid infusion, the volume of RL administered, the volume of transfused blood products and any perioperative complications were recorded.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: Sample size was determined based on power analysis of previously published studies about HES effects on TEG coagulation parameters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>.</p><p>According to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test normality was maintained for age, duration of colloid infusion, volume of crystalloids, &#x003b1;, MA and CI values before the infusion, and also &#x003b1; and MA values after the infusion. Values for body weight, height, R and K before HES infusion and R, K and CI values when the predetermined HES volume was given did not follow normal distribution. For inter-group comparisons, t test was used to compare age, duration of colloid infusion, volume of crystalloids given, &#x003b1;, MA and CI values before and &#x003b1; and MA values after HES infusion. Mann-Whitney test was used for R and K values before and R, K and CI after HES infusion. Chi square was used to compare RBC and FPP transfused in each group.</p><p>Within the Voluven&#x000ae; group, comparisons between R, K, &#x003b1;, MA and CI values before and after the infusion were analyzed using the paired t test. In the Venofundin&#x000ae; group, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for comparisons between R, K and CI values before and after infusion. The &#x003b1; and MA values before and after Venofundin&#x000ae; infusion followed normal distribution and were compared with the paired t test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>Data obtained from 49 patients were analyzed.

Thrombelastography, a method that may be quite useful in the perioperative setting and advantageous over conventional coagulation laboratory tests was used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>.</p><p>TEG&#x000ae; variables which represent a measure of clot formation kinetics were assessed. In fact, R indicates onset of coagulation, thus the time for initial fibrin formation, K represents the kinetics of clot development, &#x003b1; reflects the speed of clot strengthening, mostly affected by fibrinogen levels and less by platelet function and MA represents the maximum clot strength, mainly affected by platelet function/aggregation and to a lesser extent by fibrin. CI describes the patient's overall coagulation derived from the R, K and &#x003b1;. Addition of the reagent kaolin (hydrated aluminium silicate) to the <italic>in vitro</italic> sample was used to activate blood tracings and improve speed analysis.</p><p>The two colloids Voluven&#x000ae; and Venofundin&#x000ae; have similar MW, elimination half-lives and colloid osmotic effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>.

Compared to older HES solutions, Voluven&#x000ae; and Venofundin&#x000ae; are not characterized by a decreased volume expanding effect, since this is mainly affected by the number and not the size of molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. A significant characteristic is the rapid elimination as indicated by a less pronounced increase of &#x003b1;-amylase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. Rapid elimination accounts for the improved coagulation profile of these new starches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>.

Niemi <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> found that medium-MW (200 kDa) HES with a high molar substitution (0.5) induces hypocoagulability when administered postoperatively in cardiac surgery patients, possibly by affecting coagulation factors rather than platelets. In this study, thrombelastographic parameters after HES infusion were outside normal range indicating a significantly slowed clot development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>. Our results differ from these findings as we did not observe changes in the thrombelastographic parameters outside the normal range. Other studies also have shown that Voluven&#x000ae; has no significant effects on coagulation mechanism because it does not accumulate in plasma or tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>. Boldt <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> found that Venofundin&#x000ae; even if combined with NaCl 0.9 per cent produced non significant prolongation of coagulation and clot formation time, while the maximum clot firmness was slightly decreased. It has also been found that the administration of Voluven&#x000ae; in doses 24-31 ml/kg does not affect partial thromboplastin time and reduces blood loss and homologous RBC transfusions compared to HES 200/0.5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. Kasper <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> showed no increase in blood loss even with high doses (up to 50 ml/kg) of Voluven&#x000ae;. Voluven&#x000ae; has been shown to affect less than HES 200/0.5 the post-operative increase of factor VIII, which normally occurs as part of a post-operative physiological response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. In contrast to slowly degradable HES solutions, which even in doses below 25-50 ml/kg decrease factor VIII and vWF plasma levels by up to 80 per cent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, rapidly eliminated starches do not suppress the acute phase increases in factor VIII, vWF and ristocetin cofactor, even in doses as high as 70 ml/kg/day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>.</p><p>In the present study large volumes of Voluven&#x000ae; or Venofundin&#x000ae; were infused in a relatively short time and it is possible that the tendency towards reduced coagulability found, may be in part attributed to haemodilution of clot proteins and platelets. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that infusion of large volumes of colloids results in dilutional coagulopathy with prolongation of coagulation and clot formation time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>. HES physico-chemical characteristics and the electro-lyte composition of the solvent may also contribute to the coagulation profile of HES preparations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. The volume and type of crystalloid infused could also play a role in the intragroup coagulation changes seen. In our study the rate of colloid and crystalloid infusions was guided by the CVP and arterial pressure monitoring to avoid hypo-or hypervolemia and their possible impact on coagulation. Since RL has been shown to produce a mild hypercoagulability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, it might have attenuated the tendency towards hypocoagulability produced by the colloid infusions. Fries <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> have demonstrated that the coagulation mechanism is significantly less affected when RL is infused along with colloids than with colloids alone.</p><p>It should be noted that while all measurements after colloid infusion were within normal range, the values of MA and CI before infusion were above the normal range, indicating a hypercoagulable state. However, the majority of the patients participated in the study suffered from malignant tumours and the coagulability of these patients as determined by thromboelastography is accelerated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study was the omission to measure International Normalized Ratio (INR), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and factor levels along with TEG&#x000ae; measurements. Another point that should be noted is that the dose of colloids used (30 ml/kg) was not the maximum daily dose. The aim of the study was to investigate the coagulation effect of a large dose administered within a short time, thus in less than 4 h. Also, a direct comparison of the coagulation safety profile between these two HES preparations, with different origin and physicochemical properties, has not been reported in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, both HES 130/0.4 and HES 130/0.42 in the dose and for the duration of administration used in the present study were not associated with hypocoagulation or other side effects. Despite the differences regarding origin and physico-chemical properties, both produced similar effects on coagulation. Based on the thrombelastographic findings only, HES 130/0.4 and HES 130/0.42 were equally safe when administered in doses up to 30 ml/kg during major abdominal operations. More studies are required utilizing the entire range of tests on platelet functions and coagulation profiles to confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
