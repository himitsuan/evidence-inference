The women who had nausea and vomiting and did not take any medications were included in this study. 120 women were selected by simple random sampling method, and divided into three groups and were given vitamin B6, placebo, and ginger, respectively. 97 women completed the treatment.

It starts to decrease in the following weeks and in most cases, improves until the 14<sup>th</sup> week; however, it continues during the whole pregnancy in 2% of the cases.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Although the disorder is mild to moderate in most cases, it causes undesirable condition and discomfort. In recent times, maternal mortality for this cause is extremely rare and has a prevalence of about 0.5%; however, it is the most common reason for mothers&#x02019; hospitalization in the first few weeks of the pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In spite of the fact that nausea and vomiting are considered to be gestational complications, the remarkable point is a good pregnancy outcome in subjects with these complications that they are less likely to undergo abortion and/or low birth weight.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Since gestational nausea and vomiting can be gradually decreased and improved, the treatment takes longer in most women and is usually symptomatic.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Depends on the severity of symptoms, management course will be different, and it can be different from a simple change on diet to hospitalization and even receiving total parenteral nutrition.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Different methods of treatment are available. Vitamin B6, antihistamines or H<sub>1</sub> -receptor antagonists (diphenhydramine, diphenhydranate), dopamine blockers (metoclopramide) and corticosteroids, as the last step of treatment in severe cases, are used.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Given the fear of teratogenicity effects, pregnant women do not have the tendency to use of chemical drugs during pregnancy. Following the thalidomide tragedy and the incidence of major malformations, limitations have been taken seriously during pregnancy, although the rational use of drugs seems to be necessary and sensible in many cases.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Recently, much attention has been paid to herbal medicine as a therapeutic approach.
