Little is known about its association with metabolic parameters and especially with parameters influencing pathways of lipid metabolism. In the context of a clinical trial, an exploratory <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis has been performed in healthy subjects to determine whether simvastatin and/or ezetimibe influence serum irisin levels. The direct effects of simvastatin on irisin were also examined in primary human skeletal muscle cells (HSKMCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Design and Participants</title><p>A randomized, parallel 3-group study was performed in 72 men with mild hypercholesterolemia and without apparent cardiovascular disease. Each group of 24 subjects received a 14-day treatment with either simvastatin 40 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg, or their combination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Baseline irisin concentrations were not significantly correlated with age, BMI, estimated GFR, thyroid parameters, glucose, insulin, lipoproteins, non-cholesterol sterols, adipokines, inflammation markers and various molecular markers of cholesterol metabolism. Circulating irisin increased significantly in simvastatin-treated but not in ezetimibe-treated subjects. The changes were independent of changes in LDL-cholesterol and were not correlated with changes in creatine kinase levels. In HSKMCs, simvastatin significantly increased irisin secretion as well as mRNA expression of its parent peptide hormone FNDC5. Simvastatin significantly induced cellular reactive oxygen species levels along with expression of pro- and anti-oxidative genes such as Nox2, and MnSOD and catalase, respectively. Markers of cellular stress such as atrogin-1 mRNA and Bax protein expression were also induced by simvastatin. Decreased cell viability and increased irisin secretion by simvastatin was reversed by antioxidant mito-TEMPO, implying in part that irisin is secreted as a result of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent myocyte damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Simvastatin increases irisin concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. It remains to be determined whether this increase is a result of muscle damage or a protective mechanism against simvastatin-induced cellular stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00317993 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00317993">NCT00317993</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The parent trial (1) was supported in part by an investigator-initiated grant from MSD Sharp &#x00026; Dohme (Munich, Germany) and the Wilhelm-Doerenkamp Foundation (Cologne, Germany).

Regulated by PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1&#x003b1;), irisin is proteolytically processed from the product of the fibronectin type-III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5) gene prior to being released into the circulation. Irisin induces browning of subcutaneous adipocytes and thermogenesis by increasing uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) levels in both cell cultures and mouse models <xref rid="pone.0072858-Bostrom1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Considering the metabolic benefits of &#x0201c;beige/brite (brown-in-white) fat&#x0201d; formation <xref rid="pone.0072858-Ishibashi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072858-Petrovic1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, irisin administration has been proposed as a potential therapeutic tool to treat obesity and diabetes <xref rid="pone.0072858-CastilloQuan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and thus may have implications for decreasing cardiovascular risk.</p><p>A previous study from our group has suggested that age and muscle mass are the primary predictors of circulating irisin concentrations, with young male athletes having several-fold higher levels than middle-aged obese women <xref rid="pone.0072858-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, irisin levels increased in response to acute exercise and decreased after surgically induced weight loss in parallel to a decrease in body mass <xref rid="pone.0072858-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Still, there is little knowledge regarding the way irisin levels are regulated, for example by parameters involved in lipoprotein metabolism pathways. Statins are widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and for reducing cardiovascular risk <xref rid="pone.0072858-Baigent1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This becomes of particular interest given recent data indicating that statin treatment and increased cardiovascular fitness, which would be expected to elevate irisin levels, are both associated with low mortality among dyslipidemic individuals <xref rid="pone.0072858-Kokkinos1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The combination of statin treatment and increased fitness resulted in substantially lower mortality risk than either alone, reinforcing the importance of physical activity for individuals with dyslipidemia. Whether, similar to physical activity, statins may also increase irisin levels and thus affect metabolism and improve risk among dyslipidemic individuals through the irisin pathway too remains to be explored.</p><p>The current clinical trial is to our knowledge the first study to examine whether lipid-lowering drugs affect circulating irisin levels. In this study we aimed to determine the effects of simvastatin and ezetimibe on irisin by conducting a randomized study in humans, and to characterize the parameters that predict baseline irisin levels in this cohort <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To find the mechanisms related at the molecular level, we also studied the effects of simvastatin on cellular stress markers as well as on FNDC5/irisin expression and secretion in primary human skeletal muscle cells (HSKMCs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design has been published before <xref rid="pone.0072858-Berneis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072858-Berthold2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In short, the present clinical trial was a single-center prospective, randomized, parallel 3-group open-label study (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24 subjects for each group). The participants were randomized to receive simvastatin (40 mg/day), ezetimibe (10 mg/day), or simvastatin (40 mg/day) plus ezetimibe (10 mg/day) for a period of 2 weeks. Blood was drawn in the morning after a 12-h fast at days 1 (before the initiation of treatment) and 15 (at the end of the 2-week treatment period). The original study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00317993.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>The study protocol of the clinical trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Cologne, and all subjects gave written informed consent. In the <italic>ex vivo</italic> study, each subject had given written informed consent before taking part in the study as approved by the Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. For the clinical trial, seventy-two male volunteers were recruited by word of mouth and through advertisements in the Cologne area and on campus. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, LDL cholesterol concentrations &#x0003c;190 mg/dl, triglycerides &#x0003c;250 mg/dl and normal blood pressure (&#x0003c;140/90 mmHg). Individuals who had received lipid-lowering drugs within 12 weeks prior to study entry, those with a history of excessive alcohol intake, liver disease, renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;60 ml/min), rheumatologic disease, coronary heart disease, diabetes or other endocrine disorders, eating disorders, history of recent substantial (&#x0003e;10%) weight change, history of obesity (body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or taking medications known to affect lipoprotein metabolism or the immune system were excluded from the study. All patients were advised to keep their usual dietary habits and their usual exercise levels throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Biochemical assays</title><p>Lipoproteins were analyzed on the day of blood collection in the core laboratory of the Cologne University Medical Center.

Creatine kinase was measured using an automated analyzer (Hitachi cobas c311; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Insulin levels were measured by RIA (Diagnostic System Laboratories, Webster, TX; sensitivity, 1.3 &#x000b5;U/ml; inter- and intra-assay CVs, 4.7&#x02013;12.2% and 4.5&#x02013;8.3%, respectively). Insulin resistance was estimated at baseline using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index&#x02015;the product of fasting glucose (mmol/l) and insulin (&#x000b5;U/ml) divided by the constant 22.5. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was determined using the Quantikine Human C-reactive protein immunoassay (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Interleukin-6 was determined using the human IL-6 Platinum ELISA (eBioscience Diagnostics, San Diego, CA). Serum adiponectin, leptin, and resistin levels were measured using radioimmunoassays (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO, and BioVendor, Brno, Czech Republic), as previously described <xref rid="pone.0072858-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072858-Shetty1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin was measured using an ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0072858-Bluher1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Each subject had given written informed consent before taking part in the study as approved by the Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Biopsied skeletal muscle tissue was immediately placed into dissociation media containing 0.1% BSA, 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and 0.1% collagenase. Then the tissue was minced into small pieces and was incubated in 37&#x000b0;C water bath for 1 hr.

Moreover, mito-TEMPO treatment was sufficient to block the irisin secretion induced by simvastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072858-g004">Figure 4K</xref>), implying that irisin may be induced by simvastatin through an oxidative stress-mediated mechanism in HSKMCs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first prospective clinical trial investigating effects of lipid-lowering agents on irisin concentrations in humans and the first molecular study on the effect of simvastatin on irisin in human myocytes. The main finding of our study is that circulating irisin is increased in simvastatin-, but not in ezetimibe-, treated subjects independently of its lipid-lowering effect. In addition, this increase was neither correlated with creatine kinase levels nor with any clinical symptoms of myopathy. Our results from experiments in primary human muscle cells showed that simvastatin directly upregulated PGC-1&#x003b1; and FNDC5 expression and increased irisin secretion <italic>in vitro</italic>, partly through simvastatin-induced oxidative stress.</p><p>The fact that circulating irisin was increased by simvastatin and not by ezetimibe, a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor <xref rid="pone.0072858-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072858-GouniBerthold3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, could be interpreted as suggesting that the increase in irisin secretion may be related to muscle damage <xref rid="pone.0072858-Sathasivam1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Simvastatin has been reported to upregulate PGC-1&#x003b1; and to decrease oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiac muscle <xref rid="pone.0072858-Bouitbir1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, this upregulation is not observed in skeletal muscle from subjects with statin-induced myopathy <xref rid="pone.0072858-Bouitbir1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although the therapeutic effects of statins for managing cholesterol levels are well established, some statins (particularly lipophilic statins) are known to induce myopathy or rhabdomyolysis by mechanisms not yet fully understood. Though muscle weakness and pain are clinically much more frequent than rhabdomyolysis, it is hard to quantitate the frequency of these symptoms, since markers of muscle damage such as increased creatine kinase levels are often absent in these patients <xref rid="pone.0072858-Rallidis1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072858-Eckel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We found no correlation between irisin and creatine kinase levels, a currently accepted marker of muscle damage, indicating either that the increase in irisin is not related to muscle damage or that irisin is a marker of damage much more sensitive than creatine kinase. Of note, we report a borderline significant negative correlation between baseline coenzyme Q10 levels and baseline irisin (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02013;0.22, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.06). Statin therapy has been associated with decreased Q10 levels and it has been suggested that low Q10 levels may promote statin-associated myopathies as a result of mitochondrial damage <xref rid="pone.0072858-Berthold2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Whether the increase in irisin is a specific response to simvastatin treatment, as indicated by our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, or the unspecific result of muscular cell damage or other, unknown mechanisms, remains to be confirmed by future studies.</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that simvastatin, in a dose corresponding to the therapeutic dose <italic>in vivo</italic>, significantly increased atrogin-1 mRNA expression, cellular reactive oxygen species levels, and markers of apoptosis, and there was a parallel induction of FNDC5 mRNA and irisin secretion in HSKMCs. Galtier <italic>et al.</italic> have reported that in healthy volunteers who received a high dose of simvastatin (80 mg/d), subjects with the highest creatine kinase increase displayed alterations in mitochondrial respiration and muscle calcium homeostasis, as reflected by a significantly lower Vmax rotenone succinate and an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude, respectively <xref rid="pone.0072858-Galtier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Also, several studies have shown that simvastatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction leads to increased oxidative stress resulting in induction of PGC-1&#x003b1;, which is an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism <xref rid="pone.0072858-Bouitbir1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, it has been recently shown that simvastatin attenuates increases in cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content (citrate synthase enzyme activity) when combined with exercise training in overweight or obese patients at risk of the metabolic syndrome <xref rid="pone.0072858-Mikus1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>In line with these previous reports, genes related to mitochondrial oxidative stress regulation were elevated in our study, including MnSOD, by simvastatin treatment. Along with elevated oxidative stress, pro-apoptotic Bax protein expression was increased by simvastatin, with subsequent reduction in cell viability. Expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was also increased, suggesting a protective role against simvastatin-induced cellular damage, similar to previous observations <xref rid="pone.0072858-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Importantly, mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO treatment was able to reverse the reduced cell viability as well as increased irisin secretion by simvastatin in HSKMCs, implying that irisin secretion by simvastatin could be related to oxidative stress. To date, PGC-1&#x003b1; is the only known inducer of FNDC5 and indeed our data show that simvastatin treatment induced both PGC-1&#x003b1; and FNDC5 expression in HSKMCs. Interestingly, irisin levels were increased not only in the media but also in cell lysates by simvastatin. This may either be a result of increased synthesis through observed induction of FNDC5 transcription or an indication of increased storage of this protein, which has yet to be elucidated. Moreover, whether the increase in irisin/FNDC5 mediates a &#x0201c;mitohormesis&#x0201d; mechanism downstream of PGC-1&#x003b1; or is simply a result of cellular damage remains to be investigated.</p><p>Statins exert beneficial effects in both primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention based on their potent cholesterol-lowering effects <xref rid="pone.0072858-Baigent2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, the overall benefits observed appear to occur much earlier and seem to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering alone. Various of such &#x0201c;pleiotropic effects&#x0201d; of statins have been implicated in their antiatherosclerotic effects <xref rid="pone.0072858-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Regarding the proposed beneficial effect of irisin on &#x02018;browning&#x02019; of subcutaneous white adipose tissue and whole body metabolism <xref rid="pone.0072858-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, it could be postulated that an increase in irisin by statins could be beneficial, for example by influencing adipose tissue metabolism and insulin resistance. Although it has been suggested that statins may decrease body weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0072858-Boaz1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which would be in line with irisin-mediated weight reducing effects <xref rid="pone.0072858-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, no significant reports on weight change have been reported in the majority of statin trials <xref rid="pone.0072858-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Of note, the long-term diabetogenic effects of statins may be mediated via the mitochondrial damage they induce since the latter has been associated with insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0072858-Goodpaster1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In this context, considering that irisin has been found to be low in patients with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0072858-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, the statin-associated increase in irisin concentrations may indeed represent a protective compensatory reaction of the muscle cell.</p><p>The present study investigated cross-sectionally a wide variety of parameters that may predict baseline irisin concentrations in healthy men. The results of our previous study <xref rid="pone.0072858-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> suggested that there are positive correlations of irisin with muscle mass, BMI, glucose, ghrelin, and IGF-1 and negative correlations with age, insulin, cholesterol and adiponectin levels. Recently, Moreno-Navarrete <italic>et al.</italic> found an association between FNDC5 expression in muscle and BMI in obese subjects <xref rid="pone.0072858-MorenoNavarrete1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, here we found no significant correlations of circulating irisin levels with the majority of the parameters studied. This may be due to the different study sample characteristics (women <italic>vs.</italic> men, obese <italic>vs.</italic> lean, older <italic>vs.</italic> younger) or may be attributed to a smaller number of subjects, the clinical characteristics of whom showed limited variation in the present study. This may have reduced the capacity to demonstrate significant associations. Nevertheless, one of the strongest (negative) correlations was the one with NPC1L1 expression. NPC1L1 is critical for the uptake of cholesterol across plasma membrane of the intestinal enterocyte, and is the direct target of ezetimibe <xref rid="pone.0072858-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that NPC1L1 has a surprising number of new functions, beyond mediating cholesterol transport in the small intestine <xref rid="pone.0072858-Howles1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In specific, NPC1L1 seems to be involved in energy homeostasis, as Labonte <italic>et al.</italic> recently showed that NPC1L1 knock-out mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia <xref rid="pone.0072858-Labonte1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Moreover, we found a negative correlation between irisin and LDLR expression. It has been recently shown that LDLR-related protein 6 (LRP6), a member of the LDLR family, regulates body fat and glucose homeostasis by modulating PGC-1&#x003b1; expression <xref rid="pone.0072858-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. PGC-1&#x003b1; is also known to downregulate LDLR <xref rid="pone.0072858-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and stimulate SREBP2-mediated transactivation of human NPC1L1 <xref rid="pone.0072858-Iwayanagi1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Collectively, the close relationship between NPC1L1, LDLR and irisin in our study suggests that irisin may play a role in cholesterol homeostasis or <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that long-term statin treatment is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes through unknown mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0072858-Danaei1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072858-Axsom1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Given the improvement in obesity and glucose homeostasis in FNDC5 overexpressed mice <xref rid="pone.0072858-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and the inverse association between irisin concentrations and prevalent type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0072858-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, increased irisin levels by statin treatment (as observed in our study) may simply reflect a compensatory mechanism activated to limit other, deleterious effects of statins. We have previously reported that circulating irisin levels are positively correlated with glucose and negatively correlated with age, insulin, cholesterol, and adiponectin levels, indicating a feedback loop of irisin in response to deterioration of insulin sensitivity and glucose/lipid metabolism <xref rid="pone.0072858-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Strengths of our study are its novelty in terms of studying a new metabolically important hormone, its randomized design and robust statistical methodology, the blinded measurements of all end-point parameters, the excellent treatment adherence (99%, as determined by pill count) and the use of a &#x0201c;drug-na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; population, devoid of co-medications or co-morbidities which could potentially alter the results. Limitation of our study includes the short treatment period which could not have been sufficient to detect the full extent of the statin effects on irisin. No <italic>a priori</italic> power calculations were made for changes in irisin since the primary outcome parameter of the study in the parent trial was change in LDL cholesterol. In univariate analyses some statistically significant correlations were found but alpha inflation cannot be excluded as the reason driving these associations. Especially stepwise linear regression procedures have been criticized to be prone for generating chance findings due to multiple testing. Therefore we abstained from further multivariate analysis model building. Lastly, the clinical relevance of our findings remains to be established.</p><p>Considering that irisin administration has been proposed as a potential therapeutic tool to treat obesity and diabetes <xref rid="pone.0072858-CastilloQuan2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and thus may have implications for decreasing cardiovascular risk, our results are of potential clinical relevance.</p><p>
<italic>In conclusion,</italic> our results show that simvastatin increases circulating irisin concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic> after two weeks of treatment in healthy individuals and also in HSKMCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. In HSKMCs, simvastatin-induced cellular stress markers as well as protective response markers, and inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress blocked simvastatin-induced irisin secretion, suggesting a role of oxidative stress in irisin regulation in human muscle. Whether the increase in irisin levels is a specific and metabolically important effect or whether it is related unspecifically to myocyte damage and/or cellular stress needs to be investigated further. If irisin eventually proves to be related to muscle damage, it might be speculated that irisin as circulating biomarker of muscle damage is much more sensitive than currently available markers. The results presented herein are suggestive of interconnections between the irisin and lipid metabolism pathways and warrant further study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank John Chamberland for his excellent technical assistance.
