Increased treatment time has several side effects such pain, discomfort, caries, white spots formation, gingival recession and apical root resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. So Several surgical procedures have been introduced to accelerate tooth movement and reduce treatment time. However, corticotomy is considered the most clinically applied and it has been used in various forms over the past two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Corticotomy has not been widely accepted by the orthodontic community in spite of its effective in reducing orthodontic treatment time, due to its aggressive nature so that it requires full mucoperiosteal flaps, extensive removal of alveolar cortical bone with the possible post-surgical pain, swelling and hematomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Therefore, minimally invasive procedures have been recently developed to avoid the disadvantages of invasive corticotomy. These procedures do not require flap raising and they use innovative instruments to decrease the surgical trauma. Some of these minimally invasive surgical procedures are corticision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], piezocision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], computer-guided piezocision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], laser-assisted flapless corticotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and micro-osteoperforations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The acceleratory effect of minimally invasive corticotomy has been referred initially to regional accelerated phenomena (RAP) which causes transient demineralization and increase cellular activity that is responsible for accelerated tooth movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, selective alveolar decortication can induce the expression of inflammatory markers; raise cytokines levels and osteoclast activity which in turns leads to rapid tooth movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Corticotomy combined with piezoelectric surgery was introduced in 2007 by Vercelotti and Podesta. Although they recorded a significant reduction of treatment time, this procedure was quite invasive since it required flap elevation and excessive bone removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] . In 2009, Dibart et al. developed Piezocision as a minimally invasive technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], their procedure was based on small cuts in the buccal gingival to allow the piezosurgery knife to enter and perform cuts in the buccal cortical plate to stimulate the RAP phenomenon, and it also could combine piezocison with selective tunneling when soft or hard tissue grafting is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, laser was used to perform flapless corticotomy due to its advantages. Seifi in 2012 found that flapless corticotomy accomplished by ER:CR:YSGG Laser accelerated tooth movement in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, Salman and Ali reported that perforations performed by Er:YAG Laser have achieved rapid canine retraction in 15 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Although it has been claimed that minimally invasive corticotomy can accelerate canine retraction and reduce treatment time, but the scientific evidence about its efficacy is still limited according to a recent published systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. And it seems that there is no trial comparing two procedures of minimally invasive corticotomy. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of piezocision versus laser-assisted flapless cortiocotmy in accelerating canine retraction. The secondary aim was to evaluate dentoalveolar changes following canine retraction in terms of &#x02018;molar anchorage loss&#x02019; and &#x02018;canine rotation&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and registration</title><p id="Par23">This study was a randomized single-center controlled trial with a compound design; i.e. a two-arm parallel-group design with a split-mouth design for each arm.

retraction speed, since the available evidence about the efficacy of minimally-invasive surgically-assissted orthodontics (MISAO) has been shown to be limited in a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Extraction of premolars was conducted in the beginning of treatment and before appliance fitting in order to allow for quicker leveling and alignment without causing additional proclination for the anterior teeth. In addition, extraction of premolars before leveling and alignment is the usual scenario for Class II division 1 patients treated at our department and this may help in evaluting the pure impact of corticotomy when performed after leveling and alighment stage instead of being performed in conjunction with extractions.</p><p id="Par44">NiTi closed coil springs were used to retract canines because they generate a continuous light force and provide better oral heath compared to elastomeric chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Canine retraction was initiated immediately after the surgical intervention and patients were followed every 2 weeks instead of 4 weeks to take the maximum advantage of the RAP due to its transient nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Medial ends of the third palatal rugae were used as stable landmarks to measure the antero-posterior movements of the canine and first molar. Several studies have demonstrated that measurements taken relative to the third palatal rugae can be used as reliable as cephalometric superimposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The rates of upper canines&#x02019; retraction were significantly higher in the experimental sides than in the control sides in both groups. This acceleration might be explained by the induced RAP and to reduced alveolar bone resistance to tooth movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Selective removal of alveolar bone could also stimulate the expression of inflammatory markers and increase the levels of cytokines that lead to raise the activity of osteoclasts which in turn enhance bone remodeling and accelerate tooth movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Occurrence the acceleration in the first 2 months only and the gradual decrease in canine retraction speed could be attributed to the transient nature of the RAP. Wilcko et al. reported that this phenomenon had a specific pattern in its emergence and extent since it was found to start within few days following injury reaching its peak after 4 to 8&#x000a0;weeks and lasting for 2 to 4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, in the current study the RAP peaked after a month and decreased dramatically at the end of the second month. The difference between the current findings and those of Wilcko et al. could be explained by the more aggressive nature of their intervention compared to that of the current trial. The rate of canine retraction in the first month was significantly higher in the piezocision side than in the control side by approximately two-fold. The rate was still 1.5 times greater in the second month. These findings agree with those of Aksakalli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Abbas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] who reported that piezocision was able to accelerate the rate of canine retraction significantly by 1.5-2 times during the first 3&#x000a0;months of tooth movement.</p><p id="Par46">The rate of canine retraction was significantly faster in the laser-assisted flapless corticotomy compared to the control side by an approximately 2 times during the first month of follow-up. One recent trial conducted by Salman and Ali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] evaluated laser-assisted flapless corticotomy and showed that there was an increase in canine retraction speed by two-fold during a six-week follow-up period. However, there were some shortcomings with their study design such as the short follow-up time as well as the poor reporting of their outcome measures.</p><p id="Par47">Also the results of the current study in both groups agreed with Alikhani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] who showed that micro-osteoperforations accomplished by &#x02018;PROPEL&#x02019; device significantly increased the speed of canine retraction during the first month of observation.</p><p id="Par48">In the current study there were no significant differences between the experimental and control sides in both groups regarding the loss of anchorage which is compatible with the findings of Abbas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The speed of anchorage loss ranged from 0.28 to 0.65&#x000a0;mm/month in the piezocision group and from 0.32 to 0.61&#x000a0;mm/month in the Laser-assisted flapless corticotomy group; therefore, these amounts were deemed non-significant from the clinical point of view.</p><p id="Par49">The rate of canines&#x02019; rotation in the surgical side in both groups was greater compared to the control side. This can be due to the greater amount of retraction in the surgical side and to low alveolar bone density caused by surgical trauma. However the increase of canine rotation was not significant in the current study, it could be explained by the conservative nature of the applied surgical interventions in the current study without producing a significant weakening of alveolar cortical bone that would allow the upper canines to rotate considerably during retraction.</p><p id="Par50">There were no significant differences between piezocision and laser-assisted flapless corticotomy regarding all studied variables. This might be attributed to the minimally invasive nature of these two techniques, since they do not require flap elevation or suturing. Both techniques used innovative tools which were associated with fast healing of the alveolar bone (piezotome and ER:YAG laser). In addition, the amount of surgical injury was probably similar between the two techniques in spite of the difference in the design of incisions and bone cutting. No trial has been found in the literature comparing these two techniques, and therefore, it was difficult to compare the curring findings with any available published study.</p><p id="Par51">In a recent study about patients&#x02019; and orthodontists&#x02019; perectpions towards reducing treatment time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] it was found that orthodontists would be interested to use a modern acceleration technique if it can reduce orthodontic treatment time by 20-40%. Therefore, it seems that both piezocision and laser-assisted flapless corticotomy are possible adjunctive modalities in the acceleration of orthodontic tooth movement since they were found to shorten canine retraction time by approximately 25%.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par52">Although no adverse effects were observed with the two minimally invasive corticotomy procedures in the present study, cost-benefit ratio and patient-reported outcomes have not been evaluated systematically. This study did not measure the nature of canine retraction tipping or translation. Furthermore the current trial did not evaluate sex-related possible differnces in tooth movement rate and this should be taken into account in future similar work. Therefore, the generalizability of the findings of the current trial might be representative to some extent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">On the basis of the current study the following points can be concluded:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par54">Piezocision and laser-assisted flapless corticotomy seemed to be effective techniques for accelerating canine retraction; canine retraction was two times faster than the conventional retraction in the first month and 1.5 times faster in the second month.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">Piezocision and laser-assisted flapless corticotomy had no significant effects on anchorage loss or canine rotation during rapid retraction.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
