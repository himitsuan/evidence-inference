Eighty to ninety percent of people with acne scars have associated loss of collagen (atrophic scars), whereas a minority exhibit hypertrophic scars and keloids.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Severe scarring caused by acne is associated with physical and psychological distress, particularly in young adults, and often results in decreased self-esteem and diminished quality of life.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Unfortunately, acne scarring can be a difficult problem to address satisfactorily, and treatment usually requires the use of several different approaches over multiple sessions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>A number of treatments are available that reduce the appearance of acne scars, but general guidelines for optimizing acne scar treatment are unavailable. There are multiple management options, both medical and surgical, and treatment with laser devices achieve significant improvement.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In fact, facial resurfacing with fractional ablative lasers currently appears to be one of the most effective treatment options for facial scars.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These lasers abrade the surface of the skin and also help tighten the collagen fibers underneath. Fractional ablative lasers treat only a &#x02018;fraction,&#x02018; or column, of the affected skin, leaving intervening areas of skin untreated. These untreated areas help to achieve rapid re-epithelialization of the skin, and minimize the chance of prolonged and serious adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Punch elevation is another common treatment approach for acne scarring. The punch instrument is a circular blade which is used for many diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in different medical and surgical specialties.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Punch elevation may entail punch excision of a small acne scar with a punch biopsy instrument of equal or slightly greater diameter. This method is used on deep boxcar scars that have sharp edges and bases that appear normal. In the punch elevation procedure, the same tool used in punch excisions is used to remove only the base (not the walls) of the scar. After the skin heals, it is more even and the pitted or pockmarked look is greatly reduced. When the scar tissue base has been sufficiently punched, the base of the scar becomes parallel to its outline or the outer walls surrounding the scar, meaning the scar base is elevated. This elevation makes the scar appear much less deep.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>A comparative side-by-side clinical study on the efficacy and safety of combining fractional carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) resurfacing with punch elevation for the treatment of acne scars has not been previously conducted. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness and side effects of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing combined with punch elevation with fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing alone in the treatment of atrophic acne scars.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two Iranian patients aged 18&#x02013;55 years with Fitzpatrick skin types III to IV and moderate to severe atrophic acne scars on both cheeks, as assessed using the Goodman and Baron grading scale,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were enrolled in the study.</p><p>The Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Ethical Committee, Isfahan, Iran, approved the study protocol. The trial was registered with the code IRCT2014080218647N1 in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, which is a primary registry in the World Health Organization (WHO) Registry Network.</p><p>Patients signed an informed consent form for participation in the study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, lactation, active inflammatory acne, immunocompetence, history of deep chemical peeling or filler injection in the previous 6 months, history of hypertrophic scars and keloids, use of isotretinoin in the previous 6 months, allergy to anesthesia, active infection in the treatment area, premalignant or malignant lesions in the treatment area, bleeding tendencies, and history of herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection on the face.</p><p>The researchers determined which side of the patient's face was to be treated using the 10600-nm fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser alone (M&#x000d7;7000/Stamp Type, Daeshin, South Korea) and with the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser plus punch elevation (2.5&#x02013;3 mm biopsy disposable punches) using random allocation software. The assignment sequence was concealed in opaque envelopes. Treatment was performed in an outpatient setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Study intervention</title><p>Our approach to treatment of acne scars consisted of two operative steps. Initially, punch elevation using 2.5 or 3 mm biopsy punches was performed on one side of the face. Secondly, 24 h after punch elevation, a full face CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment session was performed. A second full face laser treatment session was performed 4 week later. The laser device used on each side of the face was the same in the two treatment sessions. Standardized digital photography was performed using a camera (CANON: 8.5 megapixels.). Anesthetic cream (2.5% lidocaine/prilocaine, XYLA-P Tehran Chemie Pharmaceutical Company, Iran) was applied to the treatment area under occlusion 1 h before laser treatment. The researcher performed the intervention on each side of the patient's face according to the prepared randomized sequence. The parameters set on the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser were 12-14 W, 48-56 mJ/MTZ/pulse, 13% density, pulse interval 35 ms. Patient skin response was used to set the appropriate energy for the laser treatment. Patients received prophylactic antibiotic and antiviral medications 1 day prior to treatment and continued the medications for 1 week. After treatment, patients applied an SPF 30 sunscreen cream with oil-free base and washed their face with mild soap.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>Clinical evaluation was done 1 and 4 months after the second treatment session was completed. First, two dermatologists blinded to treatment side evaluated clinical improvement of acne scars by comparing the photographs taken before treatment with those taken 1 and 4 months after the last treatment session. The grading scale was structured as follows: 1 = &#x0003c;25% (minimal) improvement, 2 = 25&#x02013;50% (moderate) improvement, 3 = 51&#x02013;75% (good) improvement, 4 = &#x0003e;75% (excellent) improvement. Second, patients were asked to evaluate their satisfaction with the treatment using a visual analog scale (VAS; A rating of 0 was no satisfaction, and a rating of10 was the best possible satisfaction). Side effects, including pain score (0 &#x02013; no pain, to 10 &#x02013; the most pain), pruritus, erythema, edema, bleeding, burning, duration of facial erythema, facial dryness, infection, ulceration, scar formation, dyspigmentation, were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were reported as means &#x000b1; SD.

For example, this may include resurfacing techniques to address superficial irregularities, dermal fillers to replace lost volume in large atrophic areas, and surgical procedures, such as punch excision, to remove deep boxcar or large icepick scars.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Some types of acne scars cannot be comprehensively repaired using conventional acne treatment methods, and some types cannot be effectively corrected by a single treatment modality, due to wide variation in their depth and width.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>A number of studies have been performed that have demonstrated the benefits of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment on acne scarring and have promoted the advantage of selective ablation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> lasers allow for more precise ablation control, some deeper scars require multiple treatment passes that could produce additional scarring.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Another limitation of the CO<sub>2</sub> laser is its depth of penetration. The laser is only effective in approximately the upper 30 &#x003bc;m of the skin, which limits the area that can be treated by the laser.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Johnson (1986) reported punch techniques for the treatment of deep acne scars using cutaneous punches and repair with steri-strips, or other methods.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Punch excision and punch elevation remain important surgical options for certain types of atrophic acne scars.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Punch techniques remain the gold standard for large, deep boxcar, and icepick scars.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>These punch techniques often entail punch excision of a single small acne scar with a punch biopsy instrument of equal or slightly greater diameter. This method is used on deep boxcar scars that have sharp edges and bases that appear normal. In the punch elevation procedure, the same tool used in punch excisions is used to remove only the base (not the walls) of the scar.</p><p>This method reduces the risk of producing texture or color differences and additional scarring.</p><p>The punch elevation method is better for improving deep acne scars than depth resurfacing is, and it can be combined with the shoulder technique or depth resurfacing depending on the type of acne scar.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Therefore, punch elevation techniques have increased the efficacy of treatment of atrophic acne scars.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In punch elevation, after the punch is performed the base is elevated and sutured flush with the surrounding normal-appearing skin, and then allowed to heal in place.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>An obvious advantage to the combination of punch elevation and laser ablation is that the laser acts superficially and punch elevation eliminates the need for multiple laser passes over deep scars.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Another advantage of combining punch elevation with laser ablation is the ability of the laser to effectively ablate the superficial portion of the scar and remove the epidermal component. This means that punch grafting is not necessary when using this technique, which eliminates complications of transplantation that often require redo grafting.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In our study, by combining laser skin resurfacing and punch elevation, all patients improved without any infection or additional scarring.</p><p>Though fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser procedures used in isolation can produce very satisfactory results, we found that the combination of multiple approaches, such as the combination of CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment with punch elevation, may be necessary to optimize treatment outcome.</p><p>A larger sample size with a longer period of follow-up may yield even more favorable results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment in combination with punch elevation improves outcome in the treatment of facial acne scars.
