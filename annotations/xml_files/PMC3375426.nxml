Here, we assessed the efficacy and safety of IVIG therapy with polyethylene glycol-treated human IgG (drug code GB-0998) for patients with corticosteroid-refractory polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) by means of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We randomly assigned 26 subjects (16 PM and 10 DM) to receive either GB-0998 or placebo. Intragroup comparison in the GB-0998 group showed statistically significant improvements due to GB-0998 administration in the primary endpoint (manual muscle test score) and secondary endpoints (serum creatine kinase level and activities of daily living score). However, significant improvements were also found in the placebo group, and comparison of the GB-0998 group with the placebo group did not show any significant difference between the groups. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of a clear intergroup difference in efficacy. Nineteen adverse drug reactions were observed in 11 of 26 subjects (42.3%), of which 2 events (decreased muscle strength and increased serum creatine kinase) were assessed as serious; however, they are previously known events. These results indicate that GB-0998 can be safely used with the same precautions as other current IVIG therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)</kwd><kwd>Manual muscle test (MMT)</kwd><kwd>Polymyositis (PM)</kwd><kwd>Dermatomyositis (DM)</kwd><kwd>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Japan College of Rheumatology 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are diffuse inflammatory myopathies of unknown etiology, causing decreased strength in the limb proximal group muscles, cervical muscles, and pharyngeal muscles, and have been designated as targets for disease treatment research by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Oral corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for patients with PM and DM, and they produce good response in approximately 80% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For patients showing either no response or incomplete response, other therapies such as methylprednisolone pulse therapy and/or concomitant immunosuppressive drug therapy are empirically used, but are not always effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, long-term and/or high-dose administration of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs may cause severe side-effects, such as infection, and therefore new therapies are required.</p><p>Here, we present the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol-treated human IgG (GB-0998) in patients with corticosteroid-resistant PM or DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was performed in 47 medical institutions in Japan. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating institution, and the trial was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Patients gave written informed consent prior to registration for this study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00335985.</p><p>The trial began with a 6-week run-in period, during which corticosteroid resistance was confirmed. Patients who had given informed consent, and had been confirmed to be resistant to corticosteroid treatment during the run-in period, were randomly allocated to receive GB-0998 (Benesis Corporation, Osaka, Japan), a polyethylene glycol-treated human normal immunoglobulin, followed by an indistinguishable placebo (GB-0998 group), or the same two treatments in the reverse order (placebo group), as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. GB-0998 at a dose of 400&#x000a0;mg (8&#x000a0;mL)/kg/day or the placebo was administered by intravenous infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days, in a double-blind manner. After an assessment duration of 8&#x000a0;weeks from the start of administration (the first period), subjects receiving the active drug were switched to receive the placebo in the second period, whereas those receiving the placebo in the first period were switched to receive the active drug in the second period. The assessment duration in the second period was 8&#x000a0;weeks, and there was an additional 4-week observation period (follow-up period) after the second period. Because of the seriousness of the disease, the second period was included in the study design to enable all subjects in the study to receive GB-0998. For ethical reasons, patients who did not show disease alleviation within 4&#x000a0;weeks after the start of the first period, rendering continuation of the study difficult, were given an early transition to the second period; i.e., these subjects were transferred to the second period without continuing in the first period for the full 8&#x000a0;weeks. For this reason, the primary evaluation was of efficacy in the first period.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Outline of study design. GB-0998 (active drug) was administered to the GB-0998 group in the first period and to the placebo group in the second period.

Decreases in the dose were allowed when side-effects were elicited by corticosteroid or immunosuppressant during the period prior to the start of test drug administration, and were also allowed depending on the patients&#x02019; medical condition following the administration of the test drug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with corticosteroid-resistant PM/DM (Japanese people, resident in Japan) who were aged 16&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Bohan and Peter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] for &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; PM/DM were considered eligible to participate in this study. Among them, those that met one of the following criteria with respect to their history of corticosteroid therapy were enrolled for this study after obtaining their informed consent:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Had received high-dose corticosteroid therapy (&#x02265;50&#x000a0;mg/day or &#x02265;1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for 1&#x000a0;month or more), starting between 6&#x000a0;weeks and 1&#x000a0;year prior to acquisition of informed consent, and continued until the day of acquisition of informed consent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In receipt of &#x02265;50&#x000a0;mg/day or &#x02265;1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day of corticosteroids on the day of acquisition of informed consent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Had received two or more methylprednisolone pulse therapies within 6&#x000a0;weeks before the acquisition of informed consent, and receiving &#x02265;30&#x000a0;mg/day or &#x02265;0.6&#x000a0;mg/kg/day of corticosteroid on the day of acquisition of informed consent.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Patients with manual muscle test (MMT) scores of &#x02264;80 points (normal score 90 points), assessed after having obtained their informed consent, and with twice the standard upper limit value of serum creatine kinase (CK) or more were tentatively enrolled, and followed for 6&#x000a0;weeks (run-in period). The patients who did not show any improvement in MMT scores and serum CK levels during these 6&#x000a0;weeks were formally registered, and received the investigational drug.</p><p>Patients excluded from participation in this study were those with malignant tumors; acute interstitial pneumonia including acute exacerbation of chronic phase; severe muscular atrophy for a long period; severe infectious disease; severe hepatic disorder or severe renal disorder; those who had a previous history of shock or hypersensitivity to the test drug; those who had a history of cerebral infarction or ischemic heart disease, or had symptom of these diseases; those who had a history of IgA deficiency diagnosed; pregnant, lactating, and possibly pregnant patients; patients who wanted to become pregnant; and those who had been administered immunoglobulin within 6&#x000a0;weeks of obtaining consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Efficacy assessment</title><p>Since muscle weakness is the most common symptom of PM/DM, changes in MMT scores were used as the primary endpoint, because the therapeutic effect could be assessed by observing the degree to which muscular strength was restored. MMT was scored on the following 18 muscles: the right and left of each of the following: deltoid, biceps brachii, brachioradialis, triceps brachii, iliopsoas, gluteus maximus, quadriceps femoris, and hamstring muscle; and the flexor and extensor muscles of the neck area. Each muscle was scored 0&#x02013;5, with a healthy state thus being a score of 90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In order to achieve consistency of evaluation, in principle, a single assessor evaluated the MMT for all patients throughout the study.</p><p>The secondary efficacy endpoints were serum CK level and the activities of daily living (ADL) score. Serum CK measurements and other clinical laboratory tests were carried out at a central laboratory, at Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). The upper limits of the normal serum CK range were taken as 270 and 150&#x000a0;IU/L for males and females, respectively. The ADL score was based on the following 15 actions, with each action being scored 0&#x02013;3, and the normal total score being 45: raising arms, taking off outer clothes, turning on water tap, combing hair, fastening buttons, getting out of bed, lifting up feet, standing up from chair, climbing stairs, walking on flat surface, turning over in bed, holding up head, sitting down on bed, having conversation, and swallowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the above endpoints, we considered the time (number of days) to discharge from hospital during the first period. Furthermore, two additional parameters evaluated were dysphagia, which was graded as none, mild, or severe by each attending physician, and the occurrence or nonoccurrence of early transition to the second period.</p><p>The safety endpoint was the occurrence or nonoccurrence of adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Target number of subjects</title><p>The number of patients meeting the criteria for inclusion in this study is very small. It was therefore considered that, with a study duration of 3&#x000a0;years, the number of subjects who could be enrolled would be limited to 20. Therefore, from the viewpoint of the feasibility of carrying out the study, the target number of subjects was set at 10 per group (a total of 20 subjects).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>As described above, the number of target patients for this study was very small, and it was not practically possible to set the target number of subjects sufficiently high to permit a clear demonstration of the superiority of GB-0998 over placebo. Therefore, the primary analysis consisted of an intragroup comparison in the GB-0998 group, using the paired <italic>t</italic> test, of changes in MMT score, serum CK level, and ADL score between before initiation of study drug administration and after administration for 8&#x000a0;weeks in the first period.</p><p>An intergroup comparison between the GB-0998 and placebo groups was also carried out as a subsidiary analysis. For this analysis, descriptive statistics were calculated separately for the two groups, with respect to the changes in MMT score, serum CK level, and ADL score between before initiation of administration during the first period and after administration for 8&#x000a0;weeks. The serum CK levels were widely scattered, depending upon the severity of disease in each subject, and logarithmic transformation was therefore carried out for efficacy evaluation in relation to change in serum CK level. Then, using the mean changes in these parameters, the point-estimation value and 95% confidence interval were calculated for the difference between the GB-0998 and placebo groups.</p><p>In addition, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to compare the time (number of days) until improvement of the MMT score in the GB-0998 and placebo groups. On the basis of a report by Dalakas et&#x000a0;al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the time at which &#x0201c;improvement&#x0201d; was taken to have occurred was the first time point when the MMT score was increased by 5 or more (and subsequently maintained at the higher level) during the period from before initiation of administration during the first period until transition to the second period. The median value of the time was calculated for each group, and the log-rank test was applied.</p><p>For the serum CK level, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to compare the time (number of days) until normalization in the GB-0998 and placebo groups. The event taken to constitute &#x0201c;normalization&#x0201d; was the serum CK reaching a level below the upper limit of the normal range for the first time during the period from before initiation of administration during the first period until transition to the second period. The median values for the groups were calculated, and the generalized Wilcoxon test was applied.</p><p>With respect to parameters other than the primary and secondary endpoints, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to compare the time (number of days) until first discharge from hospital during the first period. The median value was calculated for each of the groups.</p><p>Several supplementary analyses were also carried out, as follows. For MMT score, the percentage of subjects showing improvement was calculated for each group. In addition, for each of the individual muscles evaluated, an intergroup comparison using the paired <italic>t</italic> test was carried out for the change during the first period. For ADL score, the paired <italic>t</italic> test was used for intergroup comparison of the change in each evaluated individual action during the first period. In addition, the change in dysphagia during the first period was calculated, and the Fisher direct probability test was used for intergroup comparison of the elimination or nonelimination of dysphagia. Numbers of subjects undergoing early transition to the second period were also compared in the two groups.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach at 8&#x000a0;weeks after the start of administration in the first period, when premature discontinuation occurred in the first 8-week period, or when the second period was started before the scheduled end of the first period. Similarly, when premature discontinuation occurred in the second 8-week period, the efficacy after 8&#x000a0;weeks for the second period was assessed using the LOCF approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Background of subjects</title><p>Of 63 subjects who gave informed consent to participate in the study, corticosteroid resistance was confirmed in 26 (12 in the GB-0998 group and 14 in the placebo group).

In addition, various textbooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] present immunoglobulin formulations as treatment options for treatment-resistant PM and DM. However, the only published report of a placebo-controlled study relates to a double-blind, crossover study carried out by Dalakas et&#x000a0;al. in 1993 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the target disease for that study was treatment-resistant DM, and PM subjects were excluded.</p><p>The present authors have previously carried out two clinical studies on the use of GB-0998 to treat corticosteroid-resistant multiple PM and DM. As in the present study, the efficacy endpoints in the previous studies were MMT score, ADL score, and serum CK level, and in those studies, GB-0998 was found to be effective against corticosteroid-resistant multiple PM and DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>However, both of the previous studies were uncontrolled, and therefore the present study was designed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in order to obtain a more objective efficacy evaluation. In addition, the protocol for the present study was made stricter, in that the criteria for resistance to corticosteroid treatment were more clearly defined, including an increase of the prestudy run-in period for confirmation of resistance to 6&#x000a0;weeks from the 4&#x000a0;weeks used in the two previous studies.</p><p>With respect to the intragroup comparison in the GB-0998 group, which was the principal analysis, we found statistically significant improvements due to GB-0998 administration in the primary endpoint (MMT score) and the secondary endpoints (ADL score and serum CK level). Further, the GB-0998 group was statistically significantly superior to the placebo group with respect to the time to normalization of serum CK level and score of swallowing action. These results suggest that early normalization of serum CK level, which is an index of inflammation and increases during the active stage of PM or DM, can be achieved by administration of GB-0998. Normalization of serum CK is important for achieving improvement in muscle strength, which is the ultimate goal of treatment.</p><p>In addition, dysphagia, which is related to swallowing, occurs in an active and advanced stage of PM and DM, and is often refractory to corticosteroid treatment; this may result in aspiration pneumonia, which significantly affects the prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is therefore noteworthy that GB-0998 also appeared to improve dysphagia, a life-threatening complication of PM and DM.</p><p>With respect to safety, no severe adverse drug reactions occurred, and all serious adverse drug reactions were previously known effects. It is therefore considered that GB-0998 can be administered safely, with the same precautions that are applied in current IVIG treatments. However, a case of cerebral infarction did occur in the present study, although a causal relationship with administration of the study drug was considered unlikely. In addition, asymptomatic myocardial infarction was found as an adverse event in a previous study by the authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, there have been reports of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders, thought to be due to circulatory disturbances associated with increased blood viscosity, when high doses of immunoglobulins were administered to patients at risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the treatment of patients who have, or have a history of, cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disorders, and patients who are at high risk of developing thromboembolism, careful consideration should be given before administration of GB-0998, and careful monitoring is needed after administration.</p><p>Thus, the safety and efficacy results in the present study indicate that GB-0998 has the potential to be a useful drug for treatment of PM and DM subjects in whom corticosteroid treatment has not been effective.</p><p>However, the intragroup comparison in the placebo group also revealed significant improvements, and intergroup comparison of the changes in efficacy endpoints between before initiation of study drug administration and after administration for 8&#x000a0;weeks during the first period did not show a significant difference between the groups. In order to clarify the reasons for this, we tried to identify features of the subjects&#x02019; backgrounds that might have led to significant improvement being achieved even with placebo administration. The results suggested that the inequality of changes in MMT scores during the prestudy run-in period may have been the factor that had the most effect on intergroup difference.</p><p>The number of subjects whose MMT scores increased by 1 or more during the prestudy run-in period was 7 of 26 in the two groups (26.9%). However, a breakdown of these subjects showed that they consisted of 1 of 12 subjects in the GB-0998 group, and 6 of 14 in the placebo group, so subjects who were already showing a tendency toward recovery thus tended to be more numerous in the placebo group. When these 7 subjects were excluded, an intergroup comparison of MMT scores during the first period among the other 19 subjects, who underwent either no change or deterioration during the prestudy run-in period, gave an increased intergroup difference, 3.8, with a 95% confidence interval of &#x02212;4.4 to 11.9, although this is still not statistically significant. A detailed assessment of the above seven subjects indicated that they can be considered as subjects in whom corticosteroid treatment showed some, albeit minor, efficacy, and therefore it is conceivable there might have been a carry-over effect from the corticosteroid treatment in these subjects.</p><p>In addition to steroid carry-over effect, the possibility of steroid myopathy must be considered. The patients in the present study had been administered steroids at high doses and/or for extended periods, and steroid administration was continued during the study period. Therefore, development of steroid myopathy is a potential issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and one patient did in fact develop this condition. However, because it is difficult to distinguish muscle weakness due to steroid myopathy and that due to the primary disease, PM or DM, no evaluation of steroid myopathy was carried out in this study. Therefore, the possibility that evaluation of the primary endpoint, MMT score, was biased by the effect of steroid myopathy cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest limitation of the present study is the small number of patients included, and it is considered that the resulting intergroup bias in inclusion of subjects had a major impact on evaluation of intergroup difference. This highlights the need for great care in subject allocation to eliminate intergroup bias in future studies. However, PM and DM are rare diseases, and clinical studies with extremely limited numbers of patients are inevitably problematic.</p><p>GB-0998 was approved last year for cover by the Japanese National Health Insurance system for the indication of decreased muscle strength due to corticosteroid-resistant PM or DM. However, in the light of the present results, we suggest it would be desirable to carry out a postmarketing study with all patients administered GB-0998, in order to obtain clear evidence as to its efficacy. It will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy in accordance with the methods used in clinical studies, in order to assure comparability with the clinical study results. We think that such continuing evaluation will be important to fully characterize the efficacy of this drug in corticosteroid-resistant PM and DM, and also to ensure that the benefit for patients can be maximized.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the members of the GB-0998 Study Group who are not listed as authors but who provided valuable advice and data for the present study.</p><sec id="d29e1648"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All the authors have received consulting fees from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Osaka, Japan.
