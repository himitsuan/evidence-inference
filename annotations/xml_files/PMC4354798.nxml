Patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy underwent open-label droxidopa titration (100&#x02013;600 mg, 3&#x000d7; daily). Responders then received an additional 7-day open-label treatment at their individualized dose. Patients were subsequently randomized to continue with droxidopa or withdraw to placebo for 14 days. We then assessed patient-reported scores on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire and blood pressure measurements. Mean worsening of Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire dizziness/lightheadedness score from randomization to end of study (the primary outcome; N=101) was 1.9&#x000b1;3.2 with placebo and 1.3&#x000b1;2.8 units with droxidopa (<italic>P</italic>=0.509). Four of the other 5 Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire symptom scores and all 4 symptom-impact scores favored droxidopa, with statistical significance for the patient&#x02019;s self-reported ability to perform activities requiring standing a short time (<italic>P</italic>=0.033) and standing a long time (<italic>P</italic>=0.028). Furthermore, a post hoc analysis of a predefined composite score of all symptoms (Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire composite) demonstrated a significant benefit for droxidopa (<italic>P</italic>=0.013). There was no significant difference between groups for standing systolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic>=0.680). Droxidopa was well tolerated. In summary, this randomized withdrawal droxidopa study failed to meet its primary efficacy end point. Additional clinical trials are needed to confirm that droxidopa is beneficial in symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as suggested by the positive secondary outcomes of this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration&#x02014;</title><p>URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

In 1996, midodrine, an oral prodrug converted peripherally into desglymidodrine, a selective &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of OH based on its effectiveness in increasing upright blood pressure. Approval by the FDA was contingent on postapproval studies that would demonstrate an improvement in symptoms. Such studies are only now under way. Midodrine is well tolerated, but its use can be limited by piloerection, urinary retention, and worsening of supine hypertension.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Thus, OH remains an unmet medical need, and development of novel medications is needed.</p><p>For almost 2 decades, no other pharmacotherapy was developed for OH until recently, when droxidopa was approved by the FDA for the treatment of neurogenic OH (nOH) associated with primary diagnoses including Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure.

Each item is self-rated on a Likert scale from 0 (not bothered/no interference) to 10 (worst possible/complete interference), describing a symptom or symptom impact during the preceding week. OHSA and OHDAS composite scores are each calculated as the average of the item scores not rated zero at baseline. The study&#x02019;s primary efficacy end point was each patient&#x02019;s change on OHSA item 1, dizziness/lightheadedness, from randomization to the end of treatment. Secondary end points included change in the other 5 OHSA ratings (vision disturbance, weakness, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and head/neck discomfort) and the 4 OHDAS ratings (nOH interference with daily activities requiring standing a short time, standing a long time, walking a short time, and walking a long time). Overall OHQ composite score (the average of the OHSA and OHDAS composite scores) was a post hoc assessment.</p><p>Secondary end points also included clinicians&#x02019; ratings and patients&#x02019; self-ratings on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity and improvement scales. The CGI severity is a 7-point scale scored from 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (severe symptoms), and the CGI improvement is a 7-point scale scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</p><p>An orthostatic standing test was performed at screening, baseline, during dose optimization, at randomization, and at end of study (3 hours postdose during treatment periods).

During double-blind treatment, 15 (30.0%) droxidopa recipients and 19 (37.3%) placebo recipients reported &#x02265;1 AEs (Table S2). The most common AEs were falls (2.0% of droxidopa recipients versus 11.8% of placebo recipients), headache (4.0% versus 7.8%), urinary tract infection (4.0% versus 3.9%), and dizziness (4.0% versus 2.0%).</p><p>Thirteen droxidopa recipients (7.2%) discontinued because of AEs, all during the open-label phase. Among these AEs, the most common was dizziness, which was reported by 3 patients. Two placebo recipients (3.9%) discontinued because of AEs (loss of consciousness and syncope).</p><p>In all, 3 patients had hypertension as a reported AE. In all instances, the AE occurred during open-label treatment, was considered mild or moderate, and resolved without intervention. The observed incidence of supine hypertension was 10.9% at the end of 7 days of open-label droxidopa treatment (6 of 50 patients subsequently randomized to droxidopa versus 5 of 51 patients subsequently randomized to placebo) and 14.0% (7 patients in the droxidopa group) versus 5.9% (3 patients in the placebo group) at end of study. Evaluation of all laboratory and ECG parameters showed no clinically significant trends.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal study, the mean change in self-rated dizziness/lightheadedness (question 1 of the OHSA questionnaire, the primary outcome of the study) was numerically worse in patients randomized to withdrawal to placebo but not statistically different than among patients who continued to take droxidopa. Therefore, the trial did not meet its primary outcome end point. Nonetheless, all except one of the predefined secondary patient-reported outcomes also numerically favored droxidopa; 5 of 6 OHSA symptom ratings and all 4 OHDAS symptom-impact ratings, including 2 (activities involving standing a short time and standing a long time) for which the difference from placebo was statistically significant. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis of the predefined OHQ composite score showed a statistically significant difference favoring droxidopa. Also, CGI ratings of overall nOH severity showed a statistically significant difference favoring droxidopa on patient-rated scores and a trend favoring droxidopa on the clinician-rated scores. However, based on this trial, we cannot conclude that droxidopa is effective in nOH because the predefined primary end point failed to show a significant difference.</p><p>The efficacy of droxidopa in nOH is suggested by the results of previous smaller studies in nOH<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and confirmed in a recent phase 3, randomized, double-blind design study of 162 patients with nOH in pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson disease, or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that in the drug-induction study of Kaufmann et al,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> patients randomized to droxidopa had the greatest symptomatic, and statistical significant improvement in the dizziness/lightheadedness score, which did not reach significance in our study. A withdrawal design that enrolls only responders provides an enrichment strategy for efficacy testing. However, this is predicated on the assumption that the placebo group will return to baseline. This did not occur in our study; placebo patients experienced continuing relief of the dizziness/lightheadedness score and standing SBP at the end of the study compared with baseline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This raises the possibility of a carryover effect of droxidopa, which was unexpected given its relatively short serum half-life of 2 to 3 hours.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Substantial carryover effects have been observed for levodopa, which like droxidopa undergoes decarboxylation to become a neurotransmitter,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> despite its plasma half-life of only 1 hour.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Alternatively, patients may have improved simply by their participation in the study, eg, by better adherence to nonpharmacological treatment recommendations (increased salt and water intake, compression garments, and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated). Unfortunately, individual use of these countermeasures was not monitored, a limitation of this study.</p><p>The goal of treating OH is not to reach an arbitrary upright blood pressure but to reduce symptom burden. Accordingly, the FDA requires symptomatic improvement as the primary outcome in trials assessing the efficacy of medication of nOH. The OHQ is the only validated questionnaire available to quantify symptoms of OH.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We chose item no. 1 of the OHSA (dizziness/lightheadedness, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) as the primary outcome because this is the most characteristic symptom in OH. Other studies have used the OHQ composite score (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) as the primary outcome.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Had we chosen the OHQ composite score, this study would have met its primary outcome. Research is needed to determine which end point will best quantify symptomatic improvement in OH and to define the clinical meaningful change in that end point (ie, how much of an improvement in symptoms is needed to impact patients&#x02019; life). It is noteworthy that in this study patients could tell a difference between treatment groups in the self-reported perception of disease severity, as assessed by the CGI severity score.</p><p>The overall safety findings are consistent with the safety and tolerability profile demonstrated for droxidopa in other clinical trials. Most AEs in the present study were considered to be unrelated or unlikely to be related to treatment, were mild or moderate in severity, and rarely resulted in discontinuation from the study. Importantly, we observed a low event rate of cardiovascular events.</p><p>As expected for a pressor agent, there was an increase in the incidence of supine hypertension among droxidopa- versus placebo-treated patients. Even if the clinical significance of this increase is unclear, it highlights the need to personalize nOH treatment, and to have patients avoid the supine position during the daytime, avoid taking droxidopa within 4 hours of bedtime, and to elevate the head of the bed to reduce the risk of nocturnal supine hypertension.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This limitation is inherent to the use of all pressor agents for the treatment of nOH.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In patients with supine hypertension, physicians could consider administering droxidopa twice daily (early morning and early afternoon) to avoid nighttime hypertension, but no data are available to assess the efficacy of this regimen.</p><p>Other recent trials of droxidopa have used an enrichment design, randomizing only patients shown to respond to droxidopa treatment in an open-label dose titration phase. This follows FDA draft guidance<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and, more importantly, the recognition that patients with nOH have a wide range of responses to most medications. This emphasizes the need to individualize treatment in patients with nOH. This was further evidenced by the wide range of doses that were effective in improving symptoms during the open-label phase of this study. We should also note that current efficacy data are based on relatively short-term (2 weeks) studies. Ongoing studies are testing the persistence of effect during chronic droxidopa use. Similarly, it will be important to determine if there are subgroups of patients more likely to respond to droxidopa. In this study, the small number of patients within subgroups precluded a post hoc analysis, but individual data points by diagnostic subgroups are included in Figure S2.</p><p>In summary, droxidopa treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated, and numerous secondary outcomes and a post hoc analysis of OHQ composite score revealed significant improvement in nOH symptoms and their impact on daily activities. The predefined primary end point of this study did not reach statistical significance, and arguably this was because of persistence of symptomatic improvement during the withdrawal phase even in the placebo group; this unanticipated carryover effect reduced the power of the study design. Therefore, based on the results of this study, we cannot conclude that droxidopa is beneficial in the treatment of nOH. Nonetheless, the result of secondary end points and other controlled clinical trials are consistent with a risk/benefit profile favoring the use of droxidopa in symptomatic nOH.</p><sec><title>Perspectives</title><p>Droxidopa is the first pharmacotherapy approved for the treatment of nOH in almost 20 years, and the first to be approved based on improvement of symptoms related to OH, rather than just an improvement in upright blood pressure. It is likely that not all patients will respond to this treatment, and doses will need to be individualized in those that respond, as is the case with all therapies in this patient population. Studies are ongoing to determine the persistence of effect during chronic use.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciate the contributions of the Droxidopa 302 Investigators, who are acknowledged by name in this paper&#x02019;s online-only Data Supplement.
