It is characterized by insulin resistance, causing a decrease in transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and by a decrease in insulin secretion from the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. The most frequently used initial pharmacological agent is metformin, but metformin monotherapy often fails to maintain adequate glucose control over the long term. As a result of advancing deterioration of &#x003b2;-cell function, treatment with more than one agent is usually required over time to achieve and maintain good glycaemic control. Therefore, combining metformin with other therapies such as sulphonylureas is the next step to maintain successful control during the progressive course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>Sulphonylureas act by binding to sulphonylurea receptors on pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, leading to increased secretion of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Gliclazide is a second generation sulphonylurea that is widely used in the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes because it has similar efficacy to other sulphonylureas but a lower risk of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Nateglinide is a rapid-onset insulinotropic agent unrelated to sulphonylureas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. Because its effect on insulin secretion subsides when glucose levels fall, nateglinide has less potential to elicit hypoglycaemia than sulphonylureas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, nateglinide has minimal or no effect on body weight, also probably because its insulinotropic effects are limited to the postprandial period and thus nateglinide does not increase overall insulin exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of nateglinide plus metformin with the combination of gliclazide plus metformin, in patients for whom metformin alone had failed to maintain adequate glycaemic control. Gliclazide was selected as the most appropriate comparator because of its lower risk of hypoglycaemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This was a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, randomized study carried out over a period of 24 weeks. Patients were recruited from 24 centres across five countries, as listed in the Acknowledgements. The study was carried out according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the appropriate ethical boards and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients were eligible if they had Type 2 diabetes for a minimum of 6 months and had received metformin monotherapy for at least 3 months; the patients also had to be on a minimum metformin dose of 1000 mg per day continuously for at least 2 months prior to study entry, but remain inadequately controlled by medication, diet and physical exercise. Other inclusion criteria were a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.8&#x02013;9.0%, and a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In the 8 weeks preceding the study, and throughout the study, patients remained on their individual maximally tolerated dose of metformin.</p><p>Eligible patients received either nateglinide (Starlix, Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) or gliclazide in combination with metformin during the 24-week period. Randomization to treatment was by a computer-generated schedule via an interactive voice-responding system that assigned randomization on a study-centre basis with a block size of 4. A double-dummy technique, using identical-looking nateglinide and placebo tablets and identical-looking gliclazide and placebo capsules, was used to blind study medication assignment. Treatment regimens of nateglinide and gliclazide were started at the lowest levels (60 mg three times a day before meals and 80 mg once per day, respectively) and were titrated to the next dose level on a monthly basis up to a maximum of 180 mg before meals and 240 mg per day, respectively, during the first 3 months. Dose levels of study medication were increased if the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was &#x0003e; 7 mmol/l, if the patient had not experienced any confirmed hypoglycaemic events (symptomatic and/or asymptomatic events with plasma glucose concentration &#x02264; 4.0 mmol/l) and if the patient had not experienced more than three hypoglycaemic events in the past month.</p><p>Efficacy was determined from the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels from baseline to end point. Treatments were also assessed for the percentage of patients reaching a treatment target (end point HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c; 7% and/or a decrease &#x02265; 0.5% HbA<sub>1c</sub>), FPG and body weight after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. At baseline and after 24 weeks, patients attended the clinic after an overnight fast and received a standard breakfast consisting of 180 ml orange juice (grapefruit juice was not allowed), 60 g of bread (white, wheat or rye), 20 g jam or preserves, 10 g butter or margarine, 120 ml whole milk (3&#x02013;4% fat) or the equivalent amount of cheese plus 120 ml water, and decaffeinated coffee or tea if desired. The meal was consumed within 15 min and blood samples were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min. Glucose and insulin concentrations were measured and excursions were calculated from the difference between fasting and postprandial levels; the area under the glucose curve from 0 to 4 h (AUC<sub>0&#x02212;4 h</sub>), adjusted for pre-meal values, was calculated for patients who had at least six measurements. In addition, insulin secretion index was calculated as: homeostatis model assessment (HOMA)-B = [20 &#x000d7; fasting insulin (mU/l)]/[fasting glucose (mmol/l) &#x02013; 3.5].</p><p>Determinations of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and glucose and insulin from the meal tests were carried out at two central laboratories, one in Europe and one in the USA. Additionally, all patients were provided with glucose-monitoring devices and supplies, and were instructed on their use. Hypoglycaemic events were analysed according to whether they were asymptomatic, symptomatic or confirmed events; number of hypoglycaemic clinical symptoms and incidence rate (number of symptoms per 100 patients per month) were also determined. Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia were tachycardia, palpitations, shakiness, sweating and dizziness, hunger, blurred vision, impairment of motor function, confusion or inappropriate behaviour. An event was considered as confirmed if the self-monitored plasma glucose value obtained at the time of the event was &#x02264; 4.0 mmol/l (corresponding to blood glucose value of &#x02264; 3.6 mmol/l) or if hypoglycaemia was classified as grade 2 (i.e. an episode with sufficient neurological impairment that the patient was unable to initiate self-treatment and required assistance or hospitalization). The incidence rate of hypoglycaemic events per 100 patients per month was calculated as [(total number of events across all patients)/(total duration on treatment in days)] &#x000d7; 30 &#x000d7; 100. All adverse events were recorded; they were defined as serious if they were fatal, life-threatening, required prolonged hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constituted a congenital anomaly/birth defect or were considered medically significant. For each adverse event, the relationship to study drug treatment was classified by the investigator as suspected or not suspected.</p><p>A planned sample size of 120 patients per treatment was considered sufficient to detect an HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference of 0.5% with 90% power, assuming a dropout rate of 15% and an <sc>sd</sc> of 1.1. An <sc>ancova</sc> model was used to test the null hypothesis that nateglinide plus metformin combination therapy was as effective as gliclazide plus metformin combination therapy. The primary <sc>ancova</sc> model included effects for treatment, study centre, baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and treatment by baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> interaction. Efficacy analyses used the intent-to-treat population which included all randomized patients with at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation, and safety was assessed for all randomized patients with a post-baseline safety assessment. Evaluations from the meal test were assessed for all patients with available data; during storage and transport to the central laboratories a small number of samples were lost and thus numbers of patients with available data were reduced slightly, although analysis indicated that the population with data was equivalent to the total population. The statistical tests were conducted at the two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 262 subjects were enrolled in the study and their demographic details are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, according to treatment group; 133 were randomized to nateglinide plus metformin and 129 to gliclazide plus metformin.

The degree to which the HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were lowered is in agreement with previous studies investigating the addition of nateglinide to metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>], or the combination of another insulin secretagogue with metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. It is of interest to note that, when combined with metformin, essentially equivalent efficacy was achieved with an agent targeting primarily postprandial glucose (nateglinide/metformin reduced postprandial glucose excursion to a greater extent than gliclazide/metformin) and an agent that targets primarily fasting glucose level (gliclazide/metformin reduced FPG to a greater extent than nateglinide/metformin), highlighting the importance of the postprandial period in overall glycaemic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>].</p><p>The number of patients showing an improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was similar for both treatments. However, fewer patients in the nateglinide combination group achieved the target HbA<sub>1c</sub> of less than 7.0% at end point than in the gliclazide group. A small difference in baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>, slightly higher in nateglinide plus metformin (7.66%) compared with gliclazide plus metformin (7.57%), may account for this result. Supporting this, the composite efficacy criteria, i.e. merging an improvement of at least 0.5% or achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> less than 7.0%, showed the treatments were comparable.</p><p>The changes in FPG concentrations mirrored those observed for HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Measures of post-meal glucose control and prandial insulin secretion were either significantly better in the group of patients treated with nateglinide plus metformin or showed a corresponding trend. Control of postprandial hyperglycaemia is believed to have more of an impact on both micro- and macrovascular risk factors than reduction of elevated fasting glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of studies of mortality in relation to glycaemia, the 2-h blood glucose level was more predictive of all-cause and cardiovascular death than FPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>].</p><p>Nateglinide and gliclazide were both well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar in either group. The number of hypoglycaemic events, particularly asymptomatic events, was higher than seen in previous trials with nateglinide. However, this was likely to be because of the recommendation given to patients in the study to measure blood glucose regularly, independent of whether they were experiencing symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Also, the threshold value used to define hypoglycaemia was 4.0 mmol/l, which was relatively high compared with the level used routinely in many other clinical trials.</p><p>This is the first systematic comparison of the addition of a meglitinide vs. addition of a sulphonylurea to metformin as combination therapy in patients who were not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. A very recently published study in drug-na&#x000ef;ve patients given either nateglinide/metformin or glibenclamide/metformin combination treatment from the start also showed similar control of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, but better postprandial control with nateglinide and better FPG control with glibenclamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. The results of the present study showed that adding nateglinide provided similar efficacy to adding gliclazide to metformin for treatment of Type 2 diabetes, with HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduced to a similar extent by either treatment over the 24 weeks. However, the nateglinide combination reduced glucose excursions and increased insulin concentrations to a greater extent than the gliclazide combination after a test meal. Addition of nateglinide to metformin is an effective treatment for patients inadequately controlled by metformin alone. Further studies are being carried out to assess long-term postprandial glucose control and relationship to diabetic complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharma, Basel.
