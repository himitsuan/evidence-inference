We evaluated an evidence-informed leg ulcer care protocol with two frequently used high compression systems: &#x02018;four-layer bandage&#x02019; (4LB) and &#x02018;short-stretch bandage&#x02019; (SSB).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using individual patient data from the Canadian Bandaging Trial, a publicly funded, pragmatic, randomized trial evaluating high compression therapy with 4LB (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;215) and SSB (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;209) for community care of venous leg ulcers. We estimated costs (in 2009&#x02013;2010 Canadian dollars) from the societal perspective and used a time horizon corresponding to each trial participant&#x02019;s first year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Relative to SSB, 4LB was associated with an average 15 ulcer-free days gained, although the 95% confidence interval [&#x02212;32, 21 days] crossed zero, indicating no treatment difference; an average health benefit of 0.009 QALYs gained [&#x02212;0.019, 0.037] and overall, an average cost increase of $420 [$235, $739] (due to twice as many 4LB bandages used); or equivalently, a cost of $46,667 per QALY gained.

In particular, budget shortfalls and nursing shortages make caring for individuals with venous leg ulcers a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This chronic condition affects approximately 1% of people at some time in their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is associated with poor healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], high recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and negative impact on physical and psychological wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Best practice supported by high level evidence recommends high compression bandaging applied by well-trained clinicians for individuals with leg ulcers associated with venous insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Compression bandaging systems are all designed to improve venous return but vary by construction (knitted, woven), components (elastic, non-elastic), performance (long-stretch, short-stretch) and layers (single-layer, multiple-layer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some frequently used systems are the &#x0201c;four-layer bandage&#x0201d; system (strictly speaking a four-component system, 4LB) and the multi-component compression that includes a &#x0201c;short-stretch bandage&#x0201d; (SSB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Canadian Bandaging Trial (CBT, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;424 participants), funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, was a pragmatic, multi-centre (10 centres in three provinces), open-label, randomized comparative trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of high compression therapy with 4LB and SSB for community care of venous leg ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Results of the effectiveness analysis have been recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On average, leg ulcers in participants treated with 4LB heal slightly faster than those in SSB participants but overall, the treatment groups are not significantly different with respect to healing times, recurrence rates, health-related quality of life, or pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We described results of the cost-effectiveness analysis below.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>This cost-effectiveness analysis compared the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of high compression therapy with 4LB and SSB for individuals with venous leg ulcers using individual patient data from the CBT. The comparison was conducted within the following decision-making context: community care setting (home or nursing clinic); participating centres were supported during the pilot phase of the trial to develop a common evidence-informed protocol for venous leg ulcers (e.g., full assessment, ankle brachial pressure index to screen for arterial disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; and registered nurses (RNs) with the trial were trained on the evidence-informed protocol to reduce variation in service delivery and bandaging skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Ethics approval for the trial was received from Queen&#x02019;s University Research Ethics Board, Kingston Canada (REB# NURS-140-03).</p><p>We conducted the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given the funding source, we estimated costs from the societal perspective in the base case analysis and given the decision-making context, considered the health systems and community care perspectives in scenario analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. All costs are expressed in 2009&#x02013;2010 Canadian dollars. We measured QALYs during the first year of the trial and therefore did not use discounting of future outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>The patient population is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In total, 424 consenting individuals referred for community care with a venous leg ulcer were randomized to 4LB (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;215) and SSB (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;209). In total, 23 (11%) 4LB participants were lost to follow-up and 57 (27%) participants discontinued therapy before healing. The corresponding number for SSB participants was 10 (5%) and 44 (21%). Reasons for lost to follow-up and discontinuation are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Participants were on average 65 years of age, of whom 80% were fully mobile.</p></sec><sec><title>High compression therapy</title><p>In the late 1990&#x02019;s, best practice recommendations in Canada and elsewhere, supported by high level evidence, indicate that the most effective treatment for venous leg ulcers is high compression bandaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] applied by well-trained healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. By 2004 when the CBT trial started, high compression bandaging had become the standard of care, although it was unclear which high compression systems should be used in routine practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the CBT, community care RNs trained in both the 4LB and SSB systems administered the randomly allocated high compression system to participants. The 4LB system is available as a kit (i.e., Profore&#x000ae;, Smith &#x00026; Nephew Medical Ltd.) and is used once and discarded. There is no pre-packaged SSB system. Instead, the attending nurses selected the bandages (e.g., the initial protective padding layer covered with two bandaging layers) depending on a participant&#x02019;s leg circumferences. Whenever possible, SSB bandages (e.g., Comprilan&#x000ae;, Beiersdorf-Jobst, Inc.) were washed by the participants and reused.</p></sec><sec><title>Resources used</title><p>Resources utilization data were collected from baseline to healing or 12 months whichever came first. In the CBT, visit schedule (at least once a week) was not dictated by the trial protocol but rather determined by the visiting nurse. At each visit, nursing staff completed a clinical sheet detailing the care given (e.g. dressings, skin treatments), the approximate visit time, and also documented on a supply log all newly opened supplies provided by the community care authority (e.g., compression bandages, wound contact layers, cohesive bandages).</p><p>Monthly and at the time of healing, participants filled out expense forms for resources consumed or expenses incurred <italic>because</italic> of leg ulcers, including health services used (i.e., visits to hospitals, family physicians, specialists, and emergency rooms), out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., taxi fares, parking fees, and preventive supplies (e.g., stocking, alternate shoes)), hire help (e.g., cleaning, meal preparation, gardening, and snow shovelling) and lost work days.</p><p>We assumed that other resources unrelated to leg ulcers had been unchanged with treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Unit costs</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> displays unit costs of the resources used for leg ulcer care. The site-specific unit costs of treatment supplies were obtained from the participant centres. The average cost of the 4LB kit was approximately $30 (range: $23, $41). The cost of SSB depends on how the system is assembled for a participant&#x02019;s leg circumferences (e.g., 6- and 8-centimeter bandages and padding). Its cost was participant-dependent, ranging on average from $29 to $35 (overall range: $20, $42).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Unit prices used to

The effects of the two high compression systems were similar. Relative to the SSB system, the 4LB system was associated with a very small health benefit (approximately 3 quality-adjusted life-days gained over one year), and with a small cost increase (an average increase of $420 per individual per year), or equivalently, a cost of approximately $47,000 per QALY gained. For willingness-to-pay values between $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY, the probability that 4LB is more cost effective than SSB ranged from 51% to 63%, indicating that the decision about value for money is finely balanced. Our results are different from recently published studies and therefore suggest another perspective on high compression practice.</p><p>Existing clinical and economic evidence supports high compression therapy with 4LB for venous leg ulcers. Results from a meta-analysis including individual patient data from 90% of known randomized patients (or 5 trials) show that relative to SSB, 4LB is associated with significantly shorter healing time of approximately 30% and the treatment effect is consistent across patients with different prognostic profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Similar results are also reported in a related Cochrane systematic review (6 randomized trials, a total of 847 participants), but care setting remains an important factor for variation in clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A cost-effectiveness analysis using individual patient data from the largest trial in the review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the VenUS I randomized trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;387 participants) also shows that 4LB is more effective and less costly than SSB for community care of venous leg ulcers in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. On the other hand, results from the CBT (424 participants) show that in the practice context of trained RNs using an evidence-informed protocol, the choice of high compression bandage system does not materially affect healing times, recurrence rates, health-related quality of life, or pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Using CBT data, our results show that SSB is as economically attractive as 4LB. Within the right organization of care, the choice of high compression bandaging systems appears to be less important. If delivery of only one, or the other, is possible because of local factors and resources, the CBT results suggest that the expected health benefits and costs would not be compromised whichever is selected.</p><p>O&#x02019;Meara et al. conducted a systematic review (and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials with data from individual patients) evaluating 4LB and SSB for venous leg ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. They identified seven eligible trials (887 patients, and patient level data were retrieved for 5 trials, including 797 patients) and reported that 4LB was associated with significantly shorter time to healing: adjusted hazard ratio 1.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.58). The CBT increases the information available by approximately 50%. Adding the CBT data to the existing evidence in a meta-analysis conducted by CBT members (Drs. Andrea Nelson and Margaret Harrison, Journal of Community Nursing, manuscript submitted), the hazard ratio estimate is 1.14 (0.98, 1.32). The updated evidence suggests that high compression is the key to venous leg ulcer care and the method of delivery is less important than indicated in some earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are a number of important limitations. First, the CBT was open-labelled. Blinding the nurse to the compression therapy was not feasible and once bandage were applied it would have been excessively intrusive to remove them solely for the purpose of an outcome assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Healing assessment however was validated by photos assessed by an expert who was located remotely from the site of care and blinded to treatment allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We expected minimal bias potentially introduced by the open-label manoeuvre since i) the primary analysis was based upon time to healing and ii) the choice of bandage system did not seem to materially affect healing times, recurrence rates, health-related quality of life, or pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In mid 2011, we analyzed our EQ-5D data using preference values of EQ-5D health states derived for the US public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In February 2012, the preference valuation for the Canadian public became available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. According to Bansback et al. 2012, the correlation between the US and Canadian tariffs is high (i.e., 0.96), although the maximum absolute difference could be large (i.e., 0.06). This is primarily because i) compared to US participants, Canadian participants revealed lower preference values for severe health states and ii) different transformations were applied to values of worse-than-dead states (a linear and monotonic transformation was used for the US and Canadian valuation, respectively so that these values are bounded between &#x02212;1 and 0). While these are important measurement issues, they would be far less important for the average results in our cost-effectiveness analysis. This was partially because CBT participants 1) were relatively young (i.e., 65 years of age, relative to for example, approximately 71 for a similar trial, the VenUS I trial), 2) were relatively mobile (i.e., 80% relative to 61% for VenUS I), and 3) were with relatively high average EQ-5D valuation at baseline (i.e., 0.77 versus 0.60 for VenUS I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In addition, because the health-related quality of life profiles (i.e., EQ-5D, SF-12 mental and physical component scores) were not markedly different between treatment groups, we did not anticipate any major impacts of this limitation on the results of our analysis.</p><p>We valued collected resources that were deemed attributable to leg ulcers, according to the participants. We did not assess the reliability of this attribution although according to our collective experience with conducting the VenUS I and CBT trials, participants would recall most high-value items associated with their leg ulcers.</p><p>Last but not least, we only evaluated two frequently used high compression systems (4LB and SSB) although there are a large number of systems available, including newer systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings differ from the emerging clinical and economic evidence that supports high compression therapy with 4LB, and therefore suggest another perspective on high compression practice. Namely when delivered by trained registered nurses using an evidence-informed protocol, both 4LB and SSB bandages offer comparable effectiveness and value for money.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors wish to declare that to the best of our knowledge, no conflict of interest, financial or other, exists.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BP developed the analysis plan for the cost-effectiveness analysis, coordinated the project, wrote the manuscript, and was responsible for the cost-effectiveness analysis and interpretation of the results. MBH was the principal investigator of the Canadian Bandaging Trial (CBT) and responsible for the conceptualization, ethical approval, conduct and management of the CBT. She contributed to the conceptualization of the cost-effectiveness analysis and interpretation of the results. MHC conducted the cost-effectiveness analysis, and assisted with the interpretation of the results. MEC was responsible for data management of the CBT, contributed to the conceptualization of the cost-effectiveness analysis, assisted with the analysis, and contributed to the interpretation of the results. The &#x02018;Canadian Bandaging Trial Group&#x02019; members served as site investigators, contributed to the feasibility and conduct of the trial protocol, and contributed to the interpretation of the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis.
