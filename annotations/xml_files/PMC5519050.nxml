Both vaccines produce virus-like particles presenting membrane-bound Env.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Four US sites randomized 48 participants to receiving 1/10<sup>th</sup> the DNA dose as DgDgMMM given at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 months, or full dose DgDgM_M or DgDgMM_M regimens, given at 0, 2, 4, and 8 months, and 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 months, respectively. Peak immunogenicity was measured 2 weeks post-last vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>All regimens were well tolerated and safe. Full dose DgDgM_M and DgDgMM_M regimens generated Env-specific IgG to HIV-1 Env in &#x0003e;90%, IgG3 in &#x0003e;80%, and IgA in &#x0003c;20% of participants. Responses to gp140 and gp41 targets were more common and of higher magnitude than to gp120 and V1V2. The gp41 antibody included reactivity to the conserved immunodominant region with specificities known to mediate virus capture and phagocytosis and did not cross-react with a panel of intestinal flora antigens. The 3<sup>rd</sup> dose of MVA increased the avidity of elicited antibody (7.5% to 39%), the ADCC response to Bal gp120 (14% to 64%), and the one-year durability of the IgG3 responses to gp41 by 4-fold (13% vs. 3.5% retention of peak response).

It is the only one of the six preventive HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials conducted to date [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that has demonstrated protection against HIV acquisition, albeit of modest efficacy and durability [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Immune correlates analyses identified IgG antibodies to the V1V2 region of HIV-1 envelope as a significant correlate with decreased HIV-1 acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; the results from a virus sieve analysis were consistent with immune pressure on the V2 site [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the V1V2 IgG antibodies did not broadly neutralize panels of globally circulating tier 2 viruses, they did have other functional attributes, mediating antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tier 1 and 2 viruses [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, IgG3 responses correlated with functional antibody-mediated responses and decreased HIV-1 risk of infection [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, HIV-1 Env IgA responses recognizing the Env C1 region were associated with increased risk of infection and appeared to interfere with protective immune responses, possibly through binding that blocked ADCC function [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. New vaccine regimens that elicit stronger and more durable protective responses, possibly including ADCC, IgG and IgG3 to Env, with low serum IgA, may be able to protect against sexual HIV-1 transmission, and should be evaluated.</p><p>The Clade B HIV-1 vaccines furthest along in development are the GeoVax (Smyrna, GA) DNA (pGA2/JS7) vaccine and recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara poxvirus (MVA/HIV62B) vaccine. A unique property of these vaccines is that both produce non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying trimeric membrane-bound forms of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. A previous Phase 2 study of these vaccines demonstrated a predominant gp41 IgG response when two DNA priming doses were followed by two MVA boosting doses; giving three MVA doses without the DNA prime improved the gp120 IgG response [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, this earlier trial did not evaluate IgG subclasses, fine specificity of the IgG response or ADCC, immune responses found to be associated with reduced HIV acquisition in RV144. Non-human primate SIV prototypes of the JS7 DNA and MVA vaccines in a prime-boost regimen of two DNA immunizations followed by two MVA immunizations (DDMM) resulted in 81% and 76% reductions in the per challenge risk of intra-rectal infection over the first 6 and 12 weekly challenges, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p><p>Therefore, the HVTN launched a novel Phase 1 trial of the GeoVax DNA prime, MVA boost regimen, to advance understanding and enhance immunogenicity of these two vaccines used in combination. The trial compared 2 vs. 3 MVA boosts after 2 DNA primes, and a 2- vs. 4-month pause prior to the final MVA dose based on improved immunogenicity with this pause in influenza vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because of preclinical data suggesting improved protection with co-expression of GM-CSF in the JS7 DNA pGA2/JS7 vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the HVTN 094 trial substituted a GM-CSF co-expressing JS7 DNA vaccine, GEO- D03 (Dg), in these prime-boost regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study volunteers</title><p>Forty-eight HIV-uninfected adult male and female vaccinia-na&#x000ef;ve participants were enrolled at HVTN Clinical Research Sites in 4 US cities (Birmingham, Boston, Rochester, and San Francisco) from May through November 2012.

The institutional review boards or ethics committees for each site provided initial and ongoing approvals and review of the research, as did the coordinating Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center IRB. All participants provided written informed consent. Initially 12 participants (10 vaccinees; 2 placebo recipients) were randomized and enrolled into Group 1, receiving low dose GEO-D03 DNA (0.3mg), and sequentially 36 (30 vaccinees; 6 placebo recipients) were randomized in blocks of 6 and enrolled into Group 2, receiving full dose GEO-D03 DNA (3mg). Each Group was to receive GEO-D03 DNA vaccine at months 0 and 2 and three doses of MVA62B at months 4, 6 and 8. After the study was fully enrolled and prior to any Group 2 participants receiving the second MVA62B/placebo injection, the original Group 2 was divided into 2 new groups of 18 participants each: new Group 2 received full-dose DgDgMM_M at months 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10, and Group 3 received full-dose DgDgM_M at months 0, 2, 4, and 8, to evaluate immunogenicity with a 4-month pause before the final MVA dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179597.s002">S1 CONSORT checklist</xref>). To maintain the integrity of the randomization and blinding within the new groups, the first 18 of the original 36 Group 2 participants were placed into the revised Group 2, while the last 18 participants who enrolled into the original Group 2 were placed into Group 3. Due to the proximity of timing of enrollments along the split line of the original Group 2 participants, the vaccinee: placebo assignment ratio became 16:2 in the new Group 2 and 14:4 in Group 3. Follow-up for the 1/10<sup>th</sup> dose group and for each full-dose group was 6 months and 12 months, respectively after their last vaccination: month 14 for Group 1, month 22 for new Group 2 and month 20 for Group 3 during the main study.

The randomization allocation sequence was obtained by computer-generated random numbers and provided to each clinical site through the HVTN statistics and data monitoring center&#x02019;s web-based randomization system. At each site, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for dispensing study products was charged with maintaining security of the treatment assignments. Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) were blinded as to participant treatment arm assignments. All randomized participants were included in the safety analyses. The number and percentage of participants experiencing each adverse event or reactogenicity symptom were tabulated by severity and vaccination regimens. All randomized participants with reliable assay data based on blood draw dates within the allowable visit window were included in the immunogenicity analysis. Fisher&#x02019;s exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare the response rates and magnitudes, respectively, between two groups. For the comparison of two visits within a group, McNemar&#x02019;s and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare the response rates and magnitudes among responders, respectively. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binomial proportions were calculated using the Wilson score method [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. All tests were two-sided, and differences were considered statistically significant if the p-value &#x0003c;0 .05.

To assess the relationship between different assay readouts and the groups of observations in a reduced dimensionality, principal component analysis (PCA) biplot was used. PCA was performed on scaled, centered data. In PCA, the original assay readouts were algebraically converted and combined into a new set of uncorrelated composite variables, ranked in order of their contribution to explaining the variation in the data. These new variables were termed &#x0201c;principal components&#x0201d; (PCs).

B cell repertoire analysis of Env-reactive memory B cells from recipients of the DNA/recombinant Ad5 HIV-1 vaccine regimen found to be non-efficacious in the HVTN 505 trial isolated conformational gp41 mAbs that were cross-reactive with intestinal microbial antigens. These gp41-reactive antibodies were unable to neutralize HIV or mediate ADCC. Notably, the IDR was deleted in that vaccine immunogen, whereas the HVTN 094 vaccines elicited functional gp41 antibodies to the IDR. Moreover, the HVTN 094 vaccine products did not elicit circulating gp41 IgG cross-reactive with intestinal microflora. Thus, the HVTN 094 vaccine regimen explores a novel immunologic space by eliciting functional antibodies with a different but promising target antigen than was seen in RV144. Differences in the target antigen may also explain improved durability of antibodies in HVTN 094 compared with RV 144. The extent to which humoral responses to gp41, either conformational or linear, contribute to protection will be important to study in future HIV-1 vaccine efficacy studies.</p><p>Virtually all of the IgG produced by participants in the HVTN 094 trial were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes, with almost no IgG2 or IgG4 responses. In RV144, HIV-1 Env IgG3 correlated with decreased HIV-1 risk [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and has been shown to have favorable functional features, such as the ability to fix complement, neutralize HIV-1 [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and mediate ADCC and ADCP [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As in HVTN 094, IgG1 and IgG3 responses predominated in the RV144 trial; in the VAX003 trial showing no efficacy, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 were predominant [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further studies are needed to examine the full functional attributes of the antibody specificities elicited in this study.</p><p>On the other hand, IgA blocked ADCC-mediating antibodies to envelope in the RV144 trial, and ADCC was only associated decreased risk of HIV-1 infection in the absence of IgA [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Because of this competition for envelope binding between IgA and IgG, having a low IgA to IgG ratio may be important in protection, particularly if they block a functional IgG-mediated response. In HVTN 094, few participants developed envelope-specific IgA and those who did only generated low response titers.</p><p>The third MVA dose appeared to improve both the quality and longevity of the antibody response. ADCC responses were substantially improved after the third MVA dose, and the magnitude of IgG to gp140 remained stable from 6 to 12 months post-vaccination, in contrast to waning values in the two-dose MVA arm. Response rates and titers of neutralizing antibody, also increased for MN3, the virus with the most substantial neutralizing antibody responses, with the 3<sup>rd</sup> MVA dose. A previous study demonstrated improved antibody responses to an influenza DNA/monovalent inactivated vaccine prime-boost regimen if the pause between immunizations was at least 12 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we found trends but no significant difference if the second MVA was given with a 4- versus 2-month window based on the limited sample sizes. Because this comparison was made before a third MVA boost in one study arm, we cannot assess any effects of the pause on the longevity of the immune response.</p><p>A non-human primate study using an earlier HIV prototype vaccine demonstrated greater protection when the GM-CSF co-expressing DNA was used as the prime [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This increased protection correlated with an increased avidity of the Env-specific Ab response in the GM-CSF adjuvanted group. However, a subsequent non-human primate trial using a DNA prime updated to be an SIV analogue of JS7 DNA co-expressing GM-CSF generated neither improved antibody avidity nor improved protection against SHIV challenge. Although the GEO-D03 vaccine appeared safe in the HVTN 094 study, the co-expressed GM- CSF did not enhance the avidity of antibody responses (K. Seaton, personal communication), nor binding antibody or T cell responses [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Future studies will include the DNA product without inclusion of co-expressed GM-CSF.</p><p>This study is limited by its small size, calling for confirmation of the findings of this study using a DDMM_M regimen moving forward. In addition, in RV144, certain class I and class II HLA genotypes have been found to be associated with immune responses and protection [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179597.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], as was a single nucleotide polymorphism in an Fc-&#x003b3; receptor gene [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Only ADCC directed at gp120 was measured in the HVTN 094 study; gp41-mediated responses may have been missed. These may be areas to explore in future trials of these products. Finally, results of this trial in four US cities may not reflect the immune responses from participants in other clade B regions, and the cross-clade applicability of this regimen is not known.</p><p>The Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise has called for a rational approach to moving forward vaccine candidates, particularly those that build upon previous evidence of protection while exploring a novel immune space [<xref rid="pone.0179597.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The DNA prime, MVA boost HIV-1 vaccine combination has been protective in non- human primate models, and in this study, generated durable IgG and IgG3 to envelope proteins, high antibody avidity, and ADCC, with low to absent IgA responses. Future studies will explore whether adding a gp120 protein boost will improve the breadth, magnitude, or durability of the immune response..
