This disease is also called seasonal allergic rhinitis. Due to the recent worldwide increase in the number of patients with pollinosis, this condition has become a current issue<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In Japan, the increase in the number of patients with cedar pollinosis has become a social problem. During the pollen season, the airborne cedar pollen concentration is high and has a wide dispersion, resulting in a high nationwide prevalence of cedar pollinosis and marked discomfort in patients<sup><xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Cedar pollinosis occurs annually from February to April in Japan. The prevalence of nasal allergies has increased each year and has reached 39.6% according to epidemiological surveys carried out in 2006 and 2007<sup><xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Nasal allergy greatly affects the daily activities of the sufferer and the development of an effective treatment is needed.</p><p>Pranlukast is the first CysLT<sub>1</sub> (cysteinyl leukotriene) receptor antagonist discovered in Japan<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and the first to be introduced as a clinical leukotriene receptor antagonist. Efficacy of pranlukast for adult bronchial asthma<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, pediatric bronchial asthma<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and allergic rhinitis<sup><xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> has been demonstrated. In the otorhinolaryngological field, Okuda <italic>et al</italic>. was able to demonstrate the usefulness of pranlukast in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in a double-blind controlled study using epinastine hydrochloride as a control. Efficacy of pranlukast for nasal congestion has especially gained attention<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The clinical effect of pranlukast on cedar pollinosis has been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, but not fully investigated, despite the prevalence of pollinosis in Japan.</p><p>Treatment of pollinosis with antihistamines is generally recommended according to international standard guidelines such as ARIA<sup><xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, but these guidelines differ slightly from those in Japan<sup><xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. According to international guidelines, pollinosis is classified only by severity, whereas in the Japanese guideline, the importance of symptom type, in addition to severity, is emphasized for drug selection. Consequently pollinosis with aggravated congestion type is often treated with anti-leukotrienes in combination with other drugs in Japan. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of anti-leukotrienes without other drugs for congestion due to pollinosis has not been demonstrated. There are also a few reports which show that the effect of anti-leukotrienes in a challenge chamber is weaker than that of antihistamines<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Under such a background, we decided to investigate the effect of pranlukast without other drugs on pollinosis symptoms induced by cedar pollen exposure in an OHIO Chamber<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, a standardized pollen challenge chamber, as compared with a placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="S0008-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 39 adult patients with congestion-type or combined-type cedar pollinosis were targeted.

This chamber can accommodate 13 persons and provides consistent cedar pollen exposure, so changes in subjective symptoms and objective data can be investigated<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Our results showed that development of nasal symptoms was significantly inhibited by pranlukast compared to the placebo. In particular, congestion during pollen exposure was markedly inhibited by pranlukast. Antihistamines are generally thought to be effective for histamine-induced sneezing and runny nose, but no apparent effect on congestion has been reported. Pranlukast significantly improved congestion in a double-blind study performed on perennial allergic rhinitis patients, using epinastine hydrochloride as a control, and in a placebo-controlled clinical pharmacology study with antigen sensitization<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The effect of pranlukast on congestion in pollinosis as shown in this study, suggests that pranlukast inhibits LTs produced by mast cells or eosinophils in the immediate phase, and LTs produced by eosinophils in the late phase. The effect on sneezing and runny nose in the late phase may be the result of improved nasal mucosal hypersensitivity through the inhibition of LT action by migrating cells, especially eosinophils.</p><p>Efficacy of pranlukast on allergic rhinitis appears 1&#x02013;2 weeks after oral administration<sup><xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. In this study, patients treated with pranlukast after dinner on the day before cedar pollen exposure and after breakfast on the day of exposure had reduced congestion and lower nasal symptom scores during pollen exposure. Furthermore, continuous treatment with pranlukast on the night after exposure and on the following morning significantly inhibited nasal symptoms, including congestion at night on the exposure day until noon on the following day. This suggests that treatment with pranlukast before cedar pollen season may inhibit symptoms, in other words demonstrate efficacy by preventive administration. These results also suggest the need for continuous medication.</p><p>Patients with cedar pollinosis were treated with pranlukast after dinner on the day before cedar pollen exposure in the OHIO Chamber and after breakfast on the day of exposure. As a result, cedar pollen-induced development of symptoms could be inhibited. In addition, continuous treatment after dinner following exposure and after breakfast on the following morning could inhibit recurrence of nasal and eye symptoms after cedar pollen exposure. In a pollen exposure study using a different anti-leukotriene agent, montelukast, efficacy could be noted but at an inferior level to that of antihistamines<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Patients with pollinosis and congestion symptoms were selected according to PG-MARJ recommendations, and the effect of pranlukast on congestion and inhibition of nonspecific hypersensitivity in the late phase could be demonstrated. Thus, in addition to the severity, diagnosis of symptom type is considered important in the selection of the appropriate drug for pollinosis. A similar effect between pranlukast and montelukast could also be seen<sup><xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, suggesting that the difference in results between the two challenge chamber studies could have been due to methodological differences.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Anti-leukotrienes exhibit a marked therapeutic effect on congestion. These drugs are safe and cause no adverse events, whereas antihistamines may cause central sedation. Anti-leukotrienes also improve allergic inflammation caused by eosinophil release<sup><xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, airway secretion<sup><xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and lower airway remodeling<sup><xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In this study, pranlukast showed a rapid effect on cedar pollinosis, especially for congestion, and continuous treatment was also effective for nasal symptoms including congestion. It is unclear whether the fast action of pranlukast is superior to antihistamines or not, and this may depend on the type of nasal symptoms. However, results at this time show that pranlukast is a useful drug for congestion in pollinosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>None</p></ack><sec id="S12"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>There was no funding for this study.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Declaration of financial/other relationships</title><p>There are no relationships to be declared for any of the authors.</p><p>The peer reviewers on this manuscript have disclosed that they have no relevant financial relationships.</p></sec></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="C1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Worldwide variation in the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema: ISAAC</collab></person-group>
