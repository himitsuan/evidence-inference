Alongside this randomised controlled trial, an economic evaluation was conducted consisting of a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis, using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome, with willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY set at &#x020ac;50,000 (based on Dutch guidelines for moderate severe to severe illnesses).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The economic evaluation showed that ESM-I is an optimal strategy only when willingness to pay is around &#x020ac;3000 per unit HDRS and around &#x020ac;40,500 per QALY.

In the Netherlands, twelve-month prevalence of a depressive disorder is 5.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], health care costs are estimated at 1592 million euros (1.8% of the total health care costs in 2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and disability days are eight times higher compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Because of the high disease burden of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], non-pharmacological interventions that can enhance (psychopharmacological) treatment effects have the potential to be cost-effective. Although clear evidence exists for the effectiveness of combined pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy in the treatment of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], face-to-face psychological treatment is cost-intensive and may, unfortunately, not be routinely available.

The present paper presents a trial-based economic evaluation using data from a randomised controlled trial. The purpose is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of ESM-I as add-on intervention to psychopharmacological treatment as usual, from a societal perspective.

These six sessions were held at the participating mental health institutions or at Maastricht University. In these sessions, the researcher provided the participant verbal, graphical, and written feedback using the participant&#x02019;s ESM data, delivered according to a fixed format, in a fixed order. Feedback showed actual levels of positive affect in the context of daily life activities, events, and social situations. In addition, changes in positive affect level and depressive feelings over the course of the ESM intervention were visualized (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for examples).

Using this Excel file, 5000 replications were generated. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental effects (HDRS scores); by dividing the incremental costs by the differences in QALYs, we calculated incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR).

The results suggest that ESM-I is more expensive, but also more clinically effective than both treatment as usual and pseudo-intervention.</p><p id="Par53">In the cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis, ESM-I was the most optimal strategy when willingness to pay was over &#x020ac;3000 and &#x020ac;40,500, respectively. All sensitivity analyses except one were similar to the base-case analysis. That one exception, that is the analysis unadjusted for baseline costs, had lower willingness to pay, and a probability of cost-effectiveness at &#x020ac;50,000 of 58%. In addition, CEAC showed that ESM-I cost-effectiveness probability increased rapidly towards the most favourable treatment.</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, although costs are below the threshold set for a QALY (&#x020ac;50,000), such a threshold could not be defined for the HDRS. Therefore, we can only tentatively conclude that ESM-I is cost-effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Cost-effectiveness of ESM-I in real life major depression treatment</title><p id="Par55">The present trial shows that ESM-I consisting of protocolled feedback delivered by a researcher has the potential to be cost-effective. When implementing ESM-I in real life treatment, feedback can be delivered directly to the patient and professional caregiver. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness are hypothesized to increase when the option of feedback provided by a third person (the researcher) is replaced with ESM-I feedback that forms an integral part of the treatment. ESM-I could then also be used to enrich psychological treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] with daily life contextual information and to bring that therapy out of the mental health care setting into daily life. Our six-week ESM intervention has been shown feasible in outpatients with major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but the feasibility of implementation in routine clinical practise is not yet established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Web-based feedback systems for ESM-I applications are under development. If such a web-based system allows individuals to navigate through their own feedback, this may facilitate implementation of the current ESM intervention by promoting easy access to and flexible use of feedback for patients as well as professional caregivers. This should be backed up by appropriate resources for professional caregivers including training, monitoring, and technical support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In addition, withdrawal of the professional caregiver and patient disengagement may be an important issue, requiring research to improve sustained use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Effects of ESM-I on depressive symptoms</title><p id="Par57">The ESM-I group showed lower HDRS scores at 32-weeks than the two control groups, suggesting that ESM-I reduced depressive symptoms. However, although the economic evaluation showed that ESM-I may be cost-effective, in the accompanying regression analyses (HDRS and QALYs; Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the difference between the ESM-I and the pseudo-intervention group was not statistically significant while the difference between ESM-I and control group was statistically imprecise by conventional alpha. The effect study, accompanying the present economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], did show that allocation to ESM-I was associated with a statistically significant linear decrease in HDRS depressive symptoms over time that lasted throughout the study. This decrease was significantly stronger than in the control group to a degree that can be considered clinically relevant (difference&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 HDRS units; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]). The difference with the pseudo-experimental group was clinically relevant and borderline significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For the regression analysis results accompanying the cost effectiveness results in the present paper, less data were used than in the original analyses which included all follow-up assessments. In addition, the original paper analysed subjects as randomized with available data while the present paper imputed data (using last observation carried forward).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Cost-effectiveness and severity of depression</title><p id="Par58">The study sample consisted of patients with a major depression with current symptoms in the mild to severe range, including residual depressive states. Given that meta-analytic evidence suggests that the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions may be larger in patients with higher levels of pre-treatment depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], a subgroup analysis only including patients with severe or very severe depressive symptoms was warranted. However, in the present data, the number of patients in subgroups (e.g. only 20 patients with HDRS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;19) was too low to obtain valid results. Future economic evaluations of ESM-I should include sufficient numbers of patients at each level of severity to enable subgroup analysis in patients with mild/moderate and with severe/very severe symptoms separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p id="Par59">The present study was limited to patients aged between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years (mean age 48&#x000a0;years) and more than 90% of the sample was from Dutch origin. ESM-I is designed to obtain insights in everyday life and, therefore, we recruited outpatients that could engage in ESM self-monitoring in their home environment. Outpatients were included in the study if they scored above remission level (HDRS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7) at study entrance. This mild inclusion criterion, coupled with the time intensive nature of the study protocol (multiple visits to the researcher on top of an intensive intervention consisting of 6&#x000a0;weeks of self-monitoring), may have led to recruiting mainly participants in a mild to moderate depressive state. However, this may be a rather accurate representation of the population of patients with major depression, of which the majority experiences mild to moderate symptoms, and using higher HDRS cut-offs would compromise the external validity of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. On the other hand, our sample was mostly recruited from specialised mental health care settings (approximately 20% was treated in primary care only), and had a diagnosis of major depression as well as current symptoms for which they were using antidepressants. Although the results may not be generalizable to all outpatients with major depression, they may be generalizable to outpatients with complex mental problems who are using antidepressants.</p><p id="Par60">The present paper has several limitations. First, owing to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind participants and the use of envelopes could potentially have led to biased allocation. However, given that care-providers were not involved in the randomization process and most envelopes were drawn from a distance, with one researcher drawing an envelope for another researcher, it is unlikely that subversions to the procedure took place. Researchers conducting the post-intervention assessments were also not blind to treatment allocation due to resource constraints. Thus findings may reflect a placebo response. However, the effect study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed that directly after the six-week intervention, the decrease in HDRS ratings was similar in the ESM-I group and the pseudo-intervention group, while in the pseudo-intervention group effects did not appear to persist during the full 32-weeks of the trial. It is often assumed that placebo effects in depression do not persist in the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although, this belief has been falsified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], the difference in persistence between the pseudo-intervention group and the ESM-I group may evidence that it is unlikely that our findings are completely attributable to a placebo effect. The improvement in the ESM-I group showed a persistent, steady and clinically relevant growth over time in the full 32&#x000a0;weeks, further making the possibility of a placebo effect even more unlikely.</p><p id="Par61">Second, all three treatment arms were embedded in an extensive research protocol, including regular assessment of depressive symptoms and two five-day ESM assessments. Besides treatment effects, patients may have had non-specific benefits from self-monitoring. Therefore, what has been called treatment as usual in the present paper, strictly is not. ESM-I may be even more cost-effective when compared with true treatment as usual.</p><p id="Par62">Third, we used the human capital method rather than the friction costs method to calculate work absence costs, because the PRODISQ absenteeism module only asked number of absent days during a period of 3&#x000a0;months, while friction period was longer at the time of data collection (approximately 5&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, end of the friction period could not be identified.</p><p id="Par63">Fourth, sampling uncertainty was estimated using the non-parametric bootstrapping approach. Alternatively, another common approach for the handling of trial-based data would have been to estimate the mean total costs per treatment condition using a GLM that assumes a Gamma distribution for costs (i.e., to accommodate the skewness in the distribution of costs). This would also allow for the regression-based adjustment of cost estimates through the inclusion of possible covariates in the GLM. It could therefore be considered a limitation that non-adjusted costs were reported.</p><p id="Par64">Fifth, sample sizes for the present study were rather small. Results need to be replicated in studies with larger sample sizes. However, other economic evaluations are also performed using small sample sizes. Sensitivity analyses and bootstrapping are required to correct for sampling uncertainty and to prevent chance findings. As expected, costs were not normally distributed and, therefore, a condition for regression was not met (normal distribution of the residuals). We therefore performed non-parametric bootstrap resampling. However, baseline costs were also skewed and had outliers, and regressing baseline costs onto total costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] resulted in non-normal distribution of residuals, even after transformation to the natural logarithm. Several methods to deal with the problem of outliers have been advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, removing various percentages (2, 5, 10, 20, or 30%) of observations at the extremes, resulted in non-normally distributed residuals and in inconsistent regression coefficients of baseline costs (B&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84, 0.82, 0.79, 0.72, 0.66, respectively; base-case analyses: B&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86). Therefore, the best option to correct for baseline costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] was impossible in the present data, and it is most prudent to perform the delta method to control for baseline costs rather than regression-based adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] (see also <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="Par65">Furthermore, we chose for easy methods to deal with missing data because the number of missings was limited. The proportion of missing values was not significantly associated with treatment allocation, nor with baseline and previous observed depression scores or baseline demographics. Last observation carried forward, next observation carried backward, and mean imputation have been shown to perform as good as multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">Finally, of all parameters that we varied in the sensitivity analyses, correction for baseline costs was the only factor that changed the willingness to pay, but probability of cost-effectiveness at the a priori threshold of &#x020ac;50,000 remained similar to the base-case analysis. Correction for baseline costs is relatively new in economic evaluations, in contrast to epidemiology and statistics, were controlling for baseline differences is standard practise to get valid results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The present results show that the impact of controlling for baseline may be considerable and suggest that, as in other fields of research, results without baseline correction may be invalid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par67">We may tentatively conclude that ESM-I is cost-effective in outpatients with major depression. Only tentatively because the probability that ESM-I was cost effective was only 44% at the predefined threshold of &#x020ac;50,000, while no threshold for the HDRS could be defined.</p><p id="Par68">Future studies are needed to replicate the present findings and to study patients with severe depressive symptoms separately. If future research replicates effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, we would recommend ESM-I as an addition to psychopharmacological treatment as usual. Integration of ESM-I in psychological treatment is also a possibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
