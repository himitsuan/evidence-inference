In prospective cohort studies cereal fiber intake is associated with improved insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and reduced risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes, after correction for confounders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In randomized controlled interventions several [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] previous studies show improved whole-body insulin sensitivity with HCF diets, with the effects likely being dose dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, most cereal fibers are fermented only moderately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since reduced risk of diabetes is most consistently observed with a high intake of cereal fibers, as opposed to more readily fermentable sources of fiber such as fruit and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], it is not clear whether changes in the gut microbiota and/or colonic fermentation are indeed key factors involved in conveying improved insulin sensitivity with a HCF intake.</p><p>In rodent models highly fermentable fibers such as oligofructose and resistant starch have been shown to lead to short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-induced up-regulation of pro-glucagon mRNA, resulting in increased glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and other factors that are assumed to have beneficial metabolic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, results in human studies are controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]: as an example, exposure to highly fermentable resistant starch did not result in any detectable changes in circulating GLP-1 concentrations, despite significant improvement of insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that measurable changes of circulating GLP-1 concentrations due to a high intake of cereal fiber may need as long as 9 months of continued ingestion in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>No previous studies in humans are available that performed parallel investigation of diet induced changes in dominant groups of the human gut microbiota, markers of colonic carbohydrate fermentation, and state of the art measurement of insulin sensitivity. We have recently shown that the here used isoenergetic HCF diet significantly improves whole-body insulin sensitivity by 16% from 6-weeks of dietary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We here investigated whether improved insulin sensitivity in response to the HCF diet is associated with changes in markers of colonic carbohydrate fermentation and/or in the composition of dominant groups of the human gut microbiota, concepts that could further contribute explaining the consistently observed beneficial metabolic effects of a HCF intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study had been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Potsdam (BMBF FKZ 0313826).

In brief, 111 overweight adults with features of the metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to one of four two-phased, 18-weeks isoenergetic diets, by group-matching; the percentages of energy derived from protein and carbohydrates, and intake of cereal fiber per day were 17%/52%/14 g (control); 17%/52%/43g (HCF); 28%/43%/13g (HP); and 23%/44%/26g (MIX) after 6-weeks, and 17%/51%/15g (control); 17%/51%/41g (HCF); 26%/45%/14g (HP); and 22%/46%/26g (MIX) after 18-weeks, according to 3-day food protocols. Fat-intake was aimed to be 30% of energy in all groups. Adherence was supported by intense dietary advice and the provision of tailored dietary supplements twice daily in all groups.</p><p>Out of the n = 111 participants that were randomised to their respective diets, n = 84 participants fulfilled the all inclusion criteria after 18-weeks of dietary intervention (i.e. no relevant changes in body weight during this isoenergetic intervention, no intake of drugs known to influence insulin sensitivity, such as cortisone and antibiotics, and no major problems with dietary adherance), as detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Analyses in the present study were focused on potential changes of markers of colonic carbohydrate fermentation and dominant groups of the human gut microbiota in the HCF group, which could contribute explaining the observed HCF diet-induced improvement of insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Sufficient fecal samples (correctly sampled fecal material on all 3 study days) were available in n = 69 of these participants.

All here presented analyses were performed in all participants. Diet-induced changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity were re-calculated in this subset and analysed using a mixed-model analysis for repeated measures, including the 4 dietary treatments and 3 time points (weeks 0, 6, and18) into one model. For separate investigation of dietary effects at weeks 0, 6 and 18, respectively, one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni adjustment for post hoc comparisons was performed. Not normally distributed data were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test with Mann-Whitney U-tests for comparisons in subgroups. In order to detect potentially present smaller differences in markers of colonic fermentation and dominant groups of the gut microbiota between dietary intervention groups, we additionally performed uncorrected subgroup analyses for these parameters even if there was no significant effect in the full model. Longitudinal changes within groups were addressed by two-tailed Students' T-test for paired samples. p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.

We here present results from sub-group analyses, including all participants that were not excluded according to the study protocol and provided sufficient fecal samples on all study days (n = 69). The isoenergetic dietary intervention significantly influenced whole-body insulin sensitivity (mixed-model analysis for repeated measures, treatment &#x000d7; time interaction, 0-18 weeks: p = 0.046; absolute values: M-value 3.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 (week-0) vs 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1 </sup>(week-6), p = 0.015; and M-value 3.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 (week-0) vs 4.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1 </sup>(week-18), p = 0.065). Diet induced effects on insulin sensitivity expressed as percentage of the baseline value after 6 and 18 weeks were comparable to the results in the entire study group (ANOVA, week-6, p = 0.034; week-18, p = 0.27). Therefore the subgroup described here showed similar changes in insulin sensitivity as the entire study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Further outcomes</title><p>Effects of the here investigated isoenergetic diets on body fat distribution and liver fat content have been published and showed no differences between groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Colonic fermentation of undigested dietary fibers with the production of SCFA has been proposed as one of the potential mechanisms that may explain improved insulin sensitivity and reduced diabetes risk in subjects consuming high fiber diets including diets high in cereal fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>We here show that implementation over a period of 18 weeks of a supplemented diet high in cereal fibers (&#x0003e; 40 g/day) markedly and significantly improved whole-body insulin sensitivity in the full model, but no differences between dietary groups in various markers of colonic carbohydrate fermentation including fecal SCFA, breath hydrogen concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and several of their proposed targets were detected. In subgroup analyses, the only detected diet-induced effect was an increase of fecal valerate concentrations in the HP group which was expected in agreement with the also observed increase in fecal isovalerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that has been proposed as a biomarker for dietary protein intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We further investigated diet-induced effects on dominant groups of the gut microbiota that are known to be involved in carbohydrate fermentation and again found no significant changes in the here investigated microbiota groups. <italic>Roseburia </italic>tended to increase in the HCF and to decrease in the HP group which was in agreement with a previous study showing decreased <italic>Roseburia </italic>with a lower carbohydrate intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The dietary supplements of the HCF and MIX groups also showed no <italic>in vitro </italic>fermentation, and changes in hydrogen breath tests were comparable between groups, probably explained by the fact that all four diets including the control diet were based on plant rich foods.</p><p>Therefore, the HCF diet-induced effects on whole-body insulin sensitivity were not matched by changes in markers of colonic fermentation and/or the composition of the gut microbiota, neither in the full model nor in additionally performed uncorrected subgroup analyses, and there was also no tendency to more pronounced effects after 18 versus 6 weeks of dietary intervention. The magnitude of improvement of insulin sensitivity with the HCF diet was comparable to results obtained from previous short-term (24 hours and 72 hours) randomized controlled cross-over studies from our laboratory, using the same cereal fiber extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and independent from the ability of various insoluble fibers to change markers of colonic fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, effects of cereal fiber intake on markers of glucose metabolism have been shown as short as 75 min after its intake, an interval that is likely too short to induce relevant changes on the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the few available long term studies in rodents that investigated otherwise comparable high fiber diets differing in their fermentation rate the short term beneficial effects of highly fermentable dietary fibers were abolished after prolonged intake, resulting in increased body weight and higher insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This was likely explained by a contribution of higher SCFA production to total energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], an effect that has been suggested to be relevant also in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Most importantly, data from large prospective cohort studies consistently indicate that a high cereal fiber intake reduces diabetes risk as much as 30%, whereas more readily fermentable sorts of dietary fibers from fruit and vegetables show inconclusive results on this outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We therefore suggest that improved insulin sensitivity with cereal fibers may not depend on the concept of colonic carbohydrate fermentation.</p><p>Strengths of our study included the state-of-the-art measurement of insulin sensitivity, the provision of isoenergetic diets, the provision of supplements to enhance discrimination between diets, and the use of biomarkers to assess compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Limitations were: an 18-weeks intervention might have been too short to detect changes in the gut microbiota and/or fecal SCFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and other here not measured factors (such as bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]) might have been influenced by the HCF diet. Furthermore, when FISH is used only selected bacterial groups are targeted depending on the selected probes. With a probe set covering essentially the same bacterial groups, coverage of 80% of the total human microbiota was shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; however, complete coverage would require a non-targeted 16S rRNA gene-sequencing approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] that has not been available in this study.</p><p>Finally, we investigated changes of SCFA in fecal samples and the fraction of SCFA that was potentially absorbed by the host was not measured; analysis of SCFA in portal blood samples would be desirable but is not feasible in dietary intervention studies in humans, whereas the measurement of SCFA in peripheral blood faces various limitations, due to interference with endogenous production of acetate and butyrate by fat oxidation, and changes in propionate due to amino acid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since we did not observe any HCF induced increase of SCFA at the anatomical site of production (fecal samples from the colon), it is unlikely that changes in peripheral (and/or portal) blood in the HCF group would have been detected, and if so, these were unlikely to be explained by HCF-induced increases in colonic fermentation since colonic/fecal SCFA were unchanged in this group.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the combination of results including lack of <italic>in vitro </italic>fermentation of the cereal fiber extract as used for preparation of the dietary supplements in the HCF and MIX groups, no diet-induced changes in breath hydrogen concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], no changes in the composition of dominant groups of the gut microbiota, and unchanged fecal SCFA concentrations including the measurement of several of their proposed targets (serum ghrelin, several inflammatory markers) did not support the hypothesis that cereal fiber induced production of SCFA was a key driver in the here observed rapid onset improvement of whole-body insulin sensitivity with the HCF diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Potential changes in SCFA and dominant groups of the gut microbiota in longer-term interventions may further contribute to beneficial effects of HCF diets. However, our here provided data do not lend support to the hypothesis that colonic carbohydrate fermentation with the production of SCFA was one of the key mechanisms mediating the observed rapid onset and significant improvement of whole-body insulin sensitivity in overweight subjects consuming a supplemented HCF-diet.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>HCF: high cereal fiber; HP: high protein; SCFA: short chain fatty acids; BMI: body mass index; FISH: fluorescence in situ hybridization; S6K1: serine kinase 6-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MOW and AFHP were responsible for the design of the study.
