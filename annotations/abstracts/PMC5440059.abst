Objective: To test the effect of a follow-up clinic on urinary incontinence (UI) and nocturia among older adults with hip fracture. Method: Fifty-three older adults (â‰¥65 years) 3 to 12 months following hip fracture were enrolled and randomized to receive usual care plus the intervention (B4), or usual care (UC) only. The B4 group received management by health professionals, with need-based referrals. UI, nocturia, and quality of life were measured with questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Results: There were 48 participants included in this analysis, and at baseline, 44% of study participants self-reported UI. At final assessment, six out of 24 B4 participants and 12 out of 24 UC participants reported UI. Four out of five study participants reported nocturia at baseline; this did not decrease during the study. Discussion: Following hip fracture, many older adults report UI and most report nocturia. Health professionals should be aware of the high occurrence of urinary symptoms among older adults post hip fracture.
