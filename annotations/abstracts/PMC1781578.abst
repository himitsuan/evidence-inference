No effects of ozonated autohemotherapy on inflammation response in hemodialyzed patients.



ABSTRACT.
BACKGROUND: Ozone as a strong oxidant may induce an inflammatory response. AIM: The hypothesis was verified as to whether ozonated autohemotherapy using an ozone dose in therapeutic range changes the plasma concentration of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, markers of inflammation. METHODS: In a controlled, single-blind, cross-over study, 12 chronically hemodialyzed patients with peripheral arterial disease were exposed to nine sessions of autohemotherapy with blood exposure to oxygen as a control followed by nine sessions of ozonated autohemotherapy with an ozone concentration of 50 microg/ml. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between C-reactive protein levels at baseline (1.53 +/- 1.01 mg/l), after nine sessions of control autohemotherapy (1.48 +/- 0.96 mg/l), and after nine sessions of ozonated autohemotherapy (1.55 +/- 0.84 mg/l). There was also no statistical difference between the interleukin-6 serum concentration at baseline (438 +/- 118 pg/ml), after nine sessions of control autohemotherapy (444 +/- 120 pg/ml), and after nine sessions of ozonated autohemotherapy (466 +/- 152 pg/ml). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that ozonated autohemotherapy using an ozone concentration of 50 microg/ml does not induce an inflammatory response.
