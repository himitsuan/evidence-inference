Background A ‘Patient-Reported Outcome Measure, Inquiry into Side Effects’ (PROMISE) instrument was developed for patients to report common symptoms in clinical medication reviews. Objective To determine changes in patient-reported drug-associated symptoms collected by PROMISE before and after community pharmacist-led clinical medication reviews compared with usual care. Setting Community pharmacies in the Netherlands. Methods Patients were randomised into an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). PROMISE was used to collect symptoms experienced during the previous month, and any suspected drug-associated symptoms from both groups at baseline and at follow-up after 3 months. IG patients received a one-time clinical medication review, while CG patients received usual care. Main outcome measure Mean number of drug-associated symptoms at follow-up. Results Measurements were completed by 78 IG and 67 CG patients from 15 community pharmacies. Mean numbers of drug-associated symptoms per patient at follow-up were 4.0 in the IG and 5.0 in the CG, with an incident rate ratio between the groups of 0.90 (95% CI 0.62–1.33). Mean numbers of drug-associated symptoms per patient reported at follow-up and persisting since baseline were 2.1 in the IG and 2.6 in the CG, with an incident rate ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.43–1.42). The lowest percentages of persisting drug-associated symptoms detected in the IG were ‘palpitations’ and ‘stomach pain, dyspepsia’ while in the CG they were ‘stomach pain, dyspepsia’ and ‘trembling, shivering’. Conclusion PROMISE provided meaningful information on drug-associated symptoms in clinical medication reviews, however the number of drug-associated symptoms was not reduced by performing clinical medication reviews compared with usual care.
