Aims
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), but their use is limited by hyperkalaemia and/or worsening renal function (WRF). BAY 94-8862 is a highly selective and strongly potent non-steroidal MRA. We investigated its safety and tolerability in patients with HFrEF associated with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods and results
This randomized, controlled, phase II trial consisted of two parts. In part A, the safety and tolerability of oral BAY 94-8862 [2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily (q.d.)] was assessed in 65 patients with HFrEF and mild CKD. In part B, BAY 94-8862 (2.5, 5, or 10 mg q.d., or 5 mg twice daily) was compared with placebo and open-label spironolactone (25 or 50 mg/day) in 392 patients with HFrEF and moderate CKD. BAY 94-8862 was associated with significantly smaller mean increases in serum potassium concentration than spironolactone (0.04–0.30 and 0.45 mmol/L, respectively, P < 0.0001–0.0107) and lower incidences of hyperkalaemia (5.3 and 12.7%, respectively, P = 0.048) and WRF. BAY 94-8862 decreased the levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), amino-terminal proBNP, and albuminuria at least as much as spironolactone. Adverse events related to BAY 94-8862 were infrequent and mostly mild.

Conclusion
In patients with HFrEF and moderate CKD, BAY 94-8862 5–10 mg/day was at least as effective as spironolactone 25 or 50 mg/day in decreasing biomarkers of haemodynamic stress, but it was associated with lower incidences of hyperkalaemia and WRF.
