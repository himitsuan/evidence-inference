Introduction. Periodontitis is an inflammatory process in response to dental biofilm and leads to periodontal tissue destruction. The aim of this study was the comparison of outcomes using either an enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (NHA) in regenerative periodontal therapy after 6 and 12 months. Methods. Using a parallel group, prospective randomized study design, we enrolled 19 patients in each group. The primary outcome was bone fill after 12 months. Attachment gain, probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction, and recession were secondary variables. Additionally, early wound healing and adverse events were assessed. Data analysis included test of noninferiority of NHA group (test) compared to EMD group (reference) in bone fill. Differences in means of secondary variables were compared by paired t-test, frequency data by exact Ï‡
2 test. Results. Both groups showed significant bone fill, reduction of PPD, increase in recession, and gain of attachment after 6 and 12 months. No significant differences between groups were found at any time point. Adverse events were comparable between both groups with a tendency of more complaints in the NHA group. Conclusion. The clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. EMD could have some advantage compared to NHA regarding patients comfort and adverse events. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00757159.
