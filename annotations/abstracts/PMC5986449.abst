The green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivar “Sunrouge” contains anthocyanins, catechins and flavonols. To determine whether ingesting green tea containing anthocyanins improves visual function and blood pressure (BP) in healthy adults, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed. A total of 120 healthy subjects, aged between 20 and 60 years and with a systolic BP (SBP) value of ≤125 and <155 and a diastolic BP (DBP) value <95, or a DBP of ≤75 mmHg and <95 mmHg and a SBP <155 mmHg, were randomly assigned to one of three groups. For 12 weeks, the placebo group received barley extract without catechin; another group received “Sunrouge” extract containing 11.2 mg anthocyanin and 323.6 mg epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG); and a third group received “Yabukita” extract containing 322.2 mg EGCG. Home BP, accommodation ability, visual analog scale questionnaires for eyestrain, and metabolic-associated markers were analyzed at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the intake period. The ingestion of “Sunrouge” tea significantly improved accommodation ability and eyestrain in subjects younger than 45 years and in subjects who operated visual display terminals every day. It also elevated BP. “Yabukita” tea ingestion significantly increased serum adiponectin levels. No adverse effects were observed. We conclude that long-term intake of “Sunrouge” tea containing anthocyanins and flavonols might improve visual function.
