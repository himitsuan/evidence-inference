The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics (paired t-test, independent t-test, Chi-square, and Mann–Whitney) in SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc: Chicago),

RESULTS:
The mean age of the mothers in intervention and control groups was 33.3 ± 6.3 and 33.5 ± 5.8 years, respectively. The mean age of the children in the intervention and control groups was 6.34 ± 3.37 and 5.03 ± 3.36 years. Independent t-test indicated a significant difference in self-esteem mean score after training in the intervention and control groups. Moreover, paired t-test indicated a significant difference in self-esteem mean score between before and after training in the intervention group.
