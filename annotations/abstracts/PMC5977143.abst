Postoperative ileus is one of the most important and common complications after abdominal surgery. This single-blind randomized clinical trial study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of oral pyridostigmine (60 mg) on the duration and frequency of response to the treatment of ileus after abdominal surgery on 40 patients in two 20-subject groups of oral pyridostigmine (interventional) and starch (control) in 2015. All 40 people completed the study process and entered the final analysis. In the oral Pyridostigmin group (60 mg) the mean response time for the disposal of gas and stool were 5.4 ± 4.7 h and 4.9 ± 3.4 h, respectively. Most of the participants 10 (50%) (Disposal of stool) responded to treatment 4 h after the administration of oral pyridostigmine. In the starch group, the mean response time for the disposal of gas and stool were 32.4 ± 9.9 h and 36.2 ± 10.3 h, respectively. The mean treatment response time in two groups showed a significant difference between both groups (p = 0.001). Regarding the frequency of response to treatment (disposal of gas or stool) in the 24-h period after the initiation of treatment in the oral pyridostigmine group, 95% (n = 19) of the subjects responded to the treatment in the first 24 h. However, in the starch group, only 50% (n = 10) responded to treatment in the first 24 h, the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.001). The results indicate that oral pyridostigmine can be used as a simple and effective treatment for gastrointestinal ileus.
