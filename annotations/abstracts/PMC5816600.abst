The ATTEMPT-CVD study was prospective randomized active-controlled trial and the main findings had been reported. According to baseline GFR and albuminuria categories, we divided the patients of the ATTEMPT-CVD study into 2 subgroups: (Group 1) the patients with at least one of eGFR of <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR of ≥300 mg/g creatinine, defined as G3b and/or A3; (Group 2) the patients except for Group 1, defined as the other patients. In patients with G3b and/or A3, the incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly less in ARB group than in non-ARB group (11 vs 22, respectively) (HR = 0.465: 95%CI = 0.224–0.965; P = 0.040). UACR was significantly less in ARB group than in non-ARB group during follow-up period in patients with G3b and/or A3 (P = 0.0003), while eGFR, plasma BNP levels, and blood pressure were comparable between ARB and non-ARB groups. Allocation to ARB therapy was a significant independent prognostic factor for cardiovascular events in patients with G3b and/or A3 (P = 0.0268). On the other hand, in the other patients, the occurrence of cardiovascular events was comparable between ARB and non-ARB groups. In patients with advanced CKD, ARB-based therapy may confer greater benefit in prevention of cardiovascular events than non-ARB therapy.
